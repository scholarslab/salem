<p>Bridget Bishop has developed into a colorful character in the
legendary history of Salem Village. As the first woman tried and
executed as a witch during the Salem witchcraft trials, she has
attracted a lot of imaginative speculation about her character and
behavior.</p>

<p>The Bridget Bishop that is most commonly portrayed is one who kept a
house of refreshment for travelers, and a shuffle board for the
entertainment of her guests. She generally seemed to have exhibited
certain behaviors and appearances that exposed her to some scandal. She
wore a showy costume for the austere Puritan times -- a red bodice. Her
freedom from the severity of Puritan manners and disregard of
conventional decorum in her conversation and conduct brought her into
disrepute, so the tongue of gossip was generally loosened against her.
She is portrayed as a folk heroine in Salem's story. A spirited, feisty,
buxom, and lusty woman who flaunted Puritan morals with a happy public
house where drinking and gambling occurred. Many say that it was her
flashy taste in dress, her smooth and flattering manner with men, and
the questionable gaieties that had gone on in her two taverns, which led
to people gossiping about her as a witch as far back as King Philips
War.</p>

<p>This, however, is not the same Bridget Bishop of history. Research
done by historian David Green indicates that scholars and writers have
confused Bridget Bishop of Salem with Sarah Bishop, a tavern keeper in
Salem Village. Bridget Bishop lived on a small piece of property in
Salem Town and was between fifty-five and sixty-five in 1692, when she
was accused of witchcraft. The account below follows the more
historically accurate description of Bridget Bishop's life, taken from
Bernard Rosenthal's book Salem Story.</p>

<p>In 1666, the widow Bridget Wasselbe married Thomas Oliver and had a
daughter named Christian. This marriage was less than idyllic. In 1678,
Bridget was accused of calling her husband names on the Sabbath, and
both she and her husband were sentenced to stand gagged in the market
place for their offenses. In January 1679, Bridget and Thomas were both
sentenced to be whipped for fighting. It was not unusual for Bridget's
face to be battered during her marriage to Thomas Oliver. In 1680, she
was accused of witchcraft. This accusation could have been facilitated
by Thomas' claim that "she was a bad wife . . .the devil had come bodily
to her . . . and she sat up all night with the devil." (Charles Upham,
Salem Witchcraft). This accusation occurred after her husband died
without leaving a will, and seems to be the classic case of a
vulnerable, propertied woman being accused of witchcraft. She posted
bond, and there is no record of any punishment. In 1687, she was charged
with stealing brass objects. Her record then remains clean until she is
brought up on witchcraft charges again in April 1692.</p>

<p>On April 19, 1692 at her examination, Bridget Bishop began her
testimony with courtesy and deference. This deferential attitude soon
gave way to anger as she realized that denying her involvement was not
an effective strategy. The afflicted girls were in the courtroom
swooning in response to the imagined spectral advances of Bridget
Bishop. Magistrate John Hawthorne unleashed his loaded questions,
asking, "How is it that your specter hurts those in this room?" Bridget
replied, "I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch is."
Hawthorne turned this answer to his advantage by asking, "How can you
know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch is." She replied,
"I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it." Although it
is not clear what Bridget meant by this comment, Hawthorne clearly took
it as a veiled threat and replied, "You may threaten, but you may do no
more than you are permitted" (Salem Witchcraft papers). No one can know
for certain if this bold interchange earned Bridget Bishop the
distinction of being the first hanged on the gallows.</p>

<p>On May 27, Phips established a special court of Oyer and Terminer to
try those accused of witchcraft. On June 2, Bridget Bishop was the first
person tried in the new court, perhaps because her previous witchcraft
accusation made her a likely candidate. In her trial, spectral evidence
was given an unprecedented status. She was charged with "tortur[ing],
afflict[ing], pin[ing], consum[ing], wast[ing]: &amp; torment[ing] her
victims," Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott,
and Elizabeth Hubbard. Bridget vehemently denied the charges at her
trial, believing that to be the only way to avoid execution. She did not
realize that her only hope lay in confessing to witchcraft. When Cotton
Mather wrote of the evidence against her in his book Wonders of the
Invisible World, he included preposterous stories that could best be
called gossip. One such story recounts that Bishop cast a glance upon
Salem meeting house, while walking under guard. This "look" caused a
board, which had been fastened with nails, to be removed to another
portion of the house. Her case served as a model for future cases to
come, following a very predictable pattern. The "afflicted" persons made
their accusations, which were denied by the accused; members of the
community told of past acts of witchcraft by the accused; and one or
more confessors validated the claim of the accusers. The court used
spectral evidence as the primary legal basis to convict Bridget Bishop.
Hanged on June 10, her death warrant emphasizes only the harm done to
her accusers, primarily on the day of her examination, as the legal
justification for the execution.</p>

<p>"On June 10, 1692, High Sheriff George Corwin took [Bridget Bishop]
to the top of Gallows Hill and hanged her alone from the branches of a
great oak tree. Now the honest men of Salem could sleep in peace, sure
that the Shape of Bridget would trouble them no more" (Upham). Bridget
Bishop was the first person to be hanged as a result of the infamous
Salem witchcraft trials. </p>

<head><name>Thomas Brattle</name></head>

<p>Written By Mathew Madden</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>Thomas Brattle, born in 1658, was "an opulent and cultivated Boston
merchant" and a generous Harvard alumnus. Made treasurer in 1693, a post
that he held for twenty years, the college grew in fiscal strength.
Brattle was also a noted amateur astronomer and mathematician, and a
member of the Royal Society. In 1699, following the principles of
religious toleration established by the new royal charter, he quietly
organized the Brattle Street Church, which tended toward the teachings
of the Church of England instead of staunchly Puritan doctrine.</p>

<p>Brattle's significance to the Salem witchcraft outbreak stems mainly
from his authorship on October 8, 1692 of a widely read Letter sent to
an unknown "clerical correspondent," which denounced the foundations on
which the accusations, arrests, trials, and executions were conducted in
Salem. It was sent only five days after the circulation of Increase
Mather's book Cases of Conscience that denied the theological validity
of spectral evidence. Brattle, a liberal in both politics and religion,
provided a secularized perspective on the trials. According to Perry
Miller, Brattle's letter was "the first treatment of the disaster that
step[ped] outside the scheme of the jeremiad" (New England Mind). Due to
the "highly literate and satirical tone" of Brattle's Letter, Perry
Miller refers to it as "a milestone in American literature." While
Brattle makes very clear his complete agreement with Mather's Cases, a
comparison of the tone and focus of these two works is exemplary of the
developing departure from Puritanism then underway in the Massachusetts
Bay Colony.</p>

<p>In his Letter Brattle focuses most of his account on the method of
the madness. He describes to his English correspondent the nature of the
accusations, examinations, and trials, and he brings to the attention of
the "Salem Gentlemen" some of the public criticism against the trials.
First, the method of proving guilt by requiring the accused to relieve
the suffering of the afflicted in court by a touch of the hand was of
special concern to Brattle. "I cannot but condemn this method of the
Justices, of making this touch of the hand a rule to discover
witchcraft; because I am fully persuaded that it is sorcery, and a
superstitious method, and that which we have no rule for, either from
reason or religion." Here, the place of reason before religion was more
than a stylistic device, but a method of analysis. Brattle further
writes that this kind of "sorcery" and "superstition" is not fit to be
named a new philosophy "in a land of such light as New England" and that
"the reasonable part of the world, when acquainted herewith, will laugh
at the demonstration, and conclude that the said [Salem Gentlemen] are
actually possessed, at least with ignorance and folly."</p>

<p>Second, Brattle turns his attention to the nature and validity of
confessing witches. In a methodical argument, Brattle finds that these
confessors are "unfit to be evidence either against themselves, or any
one else" and that they "do very often contradict themselves, as
inconsistently as is usual for any crazed, distempered person to do."
Hoping that the people of the colony will join him in rationally
appreciating the desperate situation the confessed "witches" are in,
Brattle argues that "his neighbors" will "be soon convinced that there
is nothing at all in these arguings, if they would but duly consider of
the premises."</p>

<p>Finally, he looks at the indictments and trials themselves. He
assails the use of spectral evidence by the Magistrates and Jury, but
does so on legal rather than theological grounds. He finds that despite
the denials made by the Salem supporters of the trials, spectral
evidence is the basis on which innocent people are convicted. Therefore,
Brattle writes that the most recently executed "went out of this world
not only with as great protestations, but also with as good shews of
innocency, as men could do."</p>

<p>After excoriating the substance and basis of the trials, Brattle
continued to denounce a number of associated practices. He noted the
ability of some accused to escape arrest and persecution by virtue of
their high social position or family relationships. Many were allowed to
escape while others were hounded into the jails. Additionally, Brattle
attacked the practice of recruiting the advice of the afflicted girls in
rooting out witchcraft, pointing specifically to the circumstances in
Andover that does "now rue the day that ever the afflicted [girls from
Salem Village] went among them". However, Brattle aimed his most
scathing criticism at the effect of this hysteria on the liberties and
freedoms enjoyed among men in the colony. "Liberty was evermore
accounted the great privilege of an Englishman; but certainly if the
devil will be heard against us, and his testimony taken to the seizing
and apprehending of us, our liberty vanishes, and we are fools if we
boast of our liberty."</p>

<p>Brattle concludes his account with what Perry Miller regards as "one
of the greatest sentences of the time, which, eschewing the jargon of
the covenant, reveals how much the theme of the jeremiads had become, if
only through the discipline of disillusion, a secular patriotism."
Brattle states, "I am afraid that ages will not wear off that reproach
and those stains which these things leave behind them upon our land."
The focus here on the effects the episode will have on "our land" was
significant for a Puritan world accustomed to viewing itself as the
domain of God.</p>

<p>Thomas Brattle's Letter pried opened a chink in the armor of the
Puritan jeremiad and the logic of the covenant by the use of reason to
combat hysteria. Miller writes that "[b]y strictly and conscientiously
applying the doctrine of the jeremiad, the court created a situation in
which meretricious confession went free and sincere denial automatically
became guilt." Whereas the Puritan covenant with God placed high value
upon confession and repentance as a cure for social ills, these became
evasive maneuvers which "did not heal the grievance, but compounded the
evil."</p>

<p>While Thomas Brattle's vision Letter of October 8, 1692 did not
contribute to ending the Salem witchcraft hysteria, it provides a
brilliant example of a growing sentiment in late-17th Century New
England that the strictures of the jeremiad and framework of the
covenant may not be the omnipotent force which many a Puritan minister
admonished his flock from the pulpits of Boston. The Letter shows,
instead, how the extreme events that occurred in Salem revealed clearly
to some the extremism and danger inherent in the reigning theology of
the day.</p>

<p>Burroughs has often been portrayed in popular accounts
of the trials mainly because some of his accusers claimed that he was
the "ring leader" of the witches and also because of the especially
dramatic nature of his execution in the presence of the Rev. Cotton
Mather.  Recent research by Mary Beth Norton has revealed that in order
to understand George Burroughs' role in the Salem witch trials, it is
necessary to see the connection between the witchcraft episode in Salem
Village and the war that was taking place in Maine's northeastern
frontier. In her book, In the Devil's Snare, Norton writes, "Burroughs,
in many ways the key figure in the entire affair, linked Salem Village
and Falmouth, Essex County and Maine, the Wabanakis and the witches."</p>

<p>George Burroughs was born to a rather well to do family in Suffolk,
England in about 1652. At a young age he left England for Massachusetts
Bay Colony and was raised by his mother in the town of Roxbury. He later
attended Harvard College and graduated in 1670.  He then moved to Maine
and started preaching in Falmouth (now Portland) until Indians attacked
the town in 1676 forcing him to leave. Eventually, in 1680 he was called
to Salem Village to be the new minister.</p>

<p>Ann Putnam, Jr., Burroughs'
initial accuser, was not personally acquainted with him, but she had
most likely heard about him from Mercy Lewis, a 17 year-old servant in
the Putnam family.  Lewis was a refugee from the Indian attacks in Maine
and knew Burroughs as a child.  Ann Putnam, like many other accusers,
probably turned gossip into a formal accusation.</p>

<p> Ann claimed that
Burroughs, was the leader of the witches and had sided with the Wabanaki
Indians and, moreover, that he bewitched Sir Edmond Andros's troops.  In
the eyes of the local gossips, Burroughs' perceived ties to the Indians
and Satan were seen as one and the same in.  Norton explains that he was
described as "black," a term that suggests a connection both to the
"black" Indians and to Satan, known as the "black man."  Word spread
that Burroughs had survived several brutal attacks by the Indians when
nearly all the other defenders at the fort where he was stationed were
murdered, people became suspicious  --  did Burroughs survive by
witchcraft?.</p>

<p>Ann had probably heard through a chain of gossip that
Burroughs was jealous that Andros employed Deodat Lawson in a position
that Burroughs had wanted.  Soon after, Lawson's daughter and wife died.
 Ann told the grand jury that she had seen the ghost of Mrs. Lawson, who
told her that Burroughs had killed her and her daughter because of a
disagreement between him and her husband. </p>

<p>Another factor working against
Burroughs was the fact that his first two wives had died.  Members of
the Putnam family testified that he was cruel to his wives, one of whom
was related to Judge Hathorne.  Ann Putnam claimed that the two wives
came to her as visions and told her that Burroughs had killed them and
that he was indeed working for the Devil. Burroughs was also known for
his superhuman strength. Men at the trial testified that they had seen
him "put his fingers into the Bung Barrall and lifted it up, and carried
it round him and set it downe again." Others claimed that he was able to
effortlessly lift up a six-foot gun using one hand. His brute strength
was more proof of his allegiance with the devil.</p>

<p>All this testimony led
the court to conclude that Burroughs was indeed a sorcerer and was in
fact the leader of the witchcraft-related events.  On April 30, 1692,
Burroughs, together with several others, was accused of witchcraft.
Thomas Putnam and Jonathan Walcott signed the original document of
complaint stating the charges. Burroughs was charged with "high
suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft done or committed by then upon
the bodies of Mary Walcot Marcy Lewis Abigail Williams Ann Putnam and
Eliz. Hubbard and Susan Sheldon." On May 4, 1692, he was forcefully
taken from his home in Wells, Maine, to Salem, and put in jail.</p>

<p>Boyer and Nissenbaum suggest that Burroughs was used as a scapegoat. By
attributing to him the role of the ringleader, the witchcraft problem
was no longer associated with the community of Salem Village but was put
upon the shoulders of one man, George Burroughs.</p>

<p>Bernard Rosenthal has also pointed to Burroughs' reputation for having 
unconventional religious beliefs. In Salem Story, Rosenthal, stresses the 
significanceof the fact that the Rev. Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather,
both prominent ministers in Boston, did not agree with Burroughs'
religious convictions. Rosenthal concludes that the Mathers approval of
Burroughs' conviction as a witch may have concealed suspicions that he
was in fact a Baptist and a witch. </p>

<p>Cotton Mather was at this time known
for his cautionary writings on the use of spectral evidence in the
trials. However, as Rosenthal suggests, in Burroughs' case Mather put
aside his views on the unreliability of spectral evidence, further
suggesting that Mather's hatred of Burroughs was based on Burroughs'
role as a religious dissident. </p>

<p>For this reason, scholars have
traditionally seen Burroughs as the one person executed for witchcraft
for his religious beliefs. On August 3, 1692, many testified against
Burroughs.  Elizabeth Hubbard, Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon, Mary
Walcott and Ann Putnam all claimed that he had come to them and tried to
force them to sign his book which Elizabeth said was written in words
"as red as blood." Accused witches such as Abigail Hobbs and Mary Warren
also charged him with bringing them into the world of Satan. He was the
"ring leader of them all" holding the meetings in Salem.</p>

<p> Burroughs' trial was the only one attended by Increase Mather.  
Mather believed that if someone could perfectly recite the Lord's Prayer 
then he or she was not a witch. However, as Robert Calef writes in his book 
More Wonders of the Invisible World, "Mr. Burroughs was carried, through the
streets of Salem to Execution; when he was upon the Ladder, he made a
Speech for the clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious
Expressions, as were to the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which
he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well worded, and
uttered with such composedness, and such (at least seeming) fervency of
Spirit, as was very affecting, and drew Tears from many ( so that is
seemed to some that the Spectators would hinder the Execution)".</p>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne describes this scene in his powerful story Main
Street and refers to Burroughs as going to a "martyr's death". Hawthorne
depicts Burroughs as an innocent victim of the terrible trials. When the
crowd calls for the execution to be stopped Hawthorne continues "Ah no;
for listen to the wise Cotton Mather, who, as he sits there on his
horse, speaks comfortable to the perplexed multitude, and tells them
that all had been religiously and justly done, and that Satan's power
shall this day receive its death-blow in New England".  Calef recorded
that, "Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse, addressed himself
to the People, partly to declare, that he [George Burroughs] was no
ordained minister, and partly to possess the People of his guilt;
saying, That the Devil has often been transformed into an Angel of
Light." In doing this he reassured the crowd of Burroughs' guilt and the
execution proceeded.</p>

<head><name>Martha Carrier</name></head>

<p>By Kate Murphy</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>Best remembered in popular lore as the 'rampant hag' described by
Cotton Mather, modern historical studies demonstrate that Martha Carrier
was a victim of Salem's outbreak of witchcraft accusations. Carrier was
accused of being in league with the devil by the circle of "afflicted"
girls, neighbors and even her own children, and hanged as a witch on
August 19, 1692. Like many of accused witches, Carrier was a poor,
disagreeable woman, for whom this was not the first accusation of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Born Martha Allen, daughter of one of the original founders of the
Massachusetts town of Andover, in 1674 Martha married below her station
to a young Welsh servant and father of her illegitimate child, Thomas
Carrier. Living for a few years in Billerica, the couple returned to
Andover in the 1680's with very little money and four children. Martha's
independent spirit and lack of deference seem to have quickly alienated
her from the rest of the community. The turning point came in 1690 when
a smallpox epidemic erupted in the town. Although her family,
particularly the men, accounted for 7 of the 13 who died of smallpox in
the town, the community of Andover blamed Martha for the tragedy.</p>

<p>Carrier's reputation as a witch found new expression two years later
when the outbreak in Salem began. As the testimony of the circle of
accusing girls reflected, the Salem community was well aware of
Andover's gossip. Susan Sheldon, Mary Walcot, Elizabeth Hubbard and Ann
Putnam screamed before the court that they could see the 13 ghosts of
Andover. Other neighbors accused her of maleficium, testifying that
after harsh words from her, evil things like sick or dead animals or
strange illnesses befell them. During her courtroom examination,
however, Carrier stood her ground and boldly asserted that those who
accused her lied. Asked if she could then look upon the girls, seemingly
possessed, without their writhing in pain, she said she would not, for
"they will dissemble if I look upon them." Later, she admonished the
magistrates, saying "it is a shamefull thing that you should mind these
folks that are out of their wits."</p>

<p>Accusations of witchcraft extended beyond Martha to the rest of her
family. Her sons Richard and Andrew, ages 18 and 15 respectively, were
tied neck to heels until blood was ready to come out of their noses.
Under such intense pressure, Martha's own children, including
seven-year-old Sarah and ten-year-old Thomas, Jr., testified against her
and confessed themselves to be witches. Young Sarah told the court that
she had been a "witch Ever Since She was Six years Old that her Moth'r
brought a red book to her and She touched it." The assistant minister
Thomas Barnard who was responsible for these confessions, managed to get
confessions from all but two of accused witches, including Martha, who
were also members of his congregation.</p>

<p>One explanation for the targeting of the Carrier family depends upon
a conspiracy theory that holds that the motive of the Andover
accusations was to punish and remove political power and social
influence from the founding families of Andover. According to the
originator of this theory, Enders Robinson, (see his book, Salem
Witchcraft) a group of ten accusers were in league with Andover's
assistant minister Rev. Thomas Barnard in order to gain control over the
town's affairs by discrediting the senior minister, Rev. Francis Dane,
and the leading families through witchcraft accusations. Robinson points
to the concentration of Andover accusations within families were either
related to Rev. Francis Dane or to the powerful founding families.
Although the correspondence he finds between these groups is
interesting, there is no strong evidence supporting such a
conspiracy.</p>

<p>An alternative explanation, put forward by Carol Karlsen in her book
,I The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, blames the disruption to the
existing socio-economic order that women inheriting a significant amount
of money or property would cause. Karlsen argues that a sizable group of
accused women were not the typical marginalized women, but wealthy and
prominent members of the community, who shared an unusual place within
society as primary heirs to money and property. Although Martha might
have inherited some property after the majority of her male relatives
died in the smallpox epidemic of 1690, such an inheritance would have
been minimal. More likely, Martha's established reputation as a witch
and as a disagreeable woman made her a target once the momentum of
accusations got out of control in Salem.</p>

<p>Born on Feb. 12th 1663 into a family of renown New England Puritan
ministers, including Rev. John Cotton and Rev. Richard Mather, Cotton
Mather seemed destined to achieve fame. His own father, Rev. Increase
Mather, also held a position of prominence as a well-admired political
leader, minister of the South Church in Boston, as well as the
presidency of Harvard College. Excelling in his entrance exams in Latin
and Greek, young Cotton began his schooling at Harvard at only 12 years
of age. After receiving his M.A. at age 18, he felt called to a life of
service in the clergy. A terrible stutter, however, forced him to delay
entering the ministry and the demands of preaching, and instead he
entertained the notion of becoming a doctor. Encouragement from a friend
eventually pulled him over this speech impediment and back to his
calling, although medicine remained a key interest throughout his life.
Mather preached his first sermon in August of 1680, and went on to be
ordained by 1685 at age 22. Besides his involvement with the witch
trials in Salem during the 1690s, Cotton Mather is remembered as one of
the most influential Puritan ministers of his day. Never achieving his
father's success as a political leader or president of Harvard, Cotton
made his mark through his efforts as a master of the pen. By the end of
his life, he had published over 400 of his works, ranging from the
subject of witchcraft to smallpox inoculation. His publication, Curiosa
Americana(1712-24), demonstrated his abilities as an accomplished
scientist, and earned him election to the prestigious Royal Society of
London, England. Although his efforts of encouragement in smallpox
inoculation were met with much resistance and nearly killed his own son,
he is recognized as having been a progressive medical advocate for his
day.</p>

<p>In regard to the Salem witch trials, however, it was Mather's
interest in the craft and actions of Satan that won him an audience with
the most powerful figures involved in the trial proceedings, several of
the judges and the local ministers in Salem. Before the outbreak of
accusations in Salem Village, Mather had already published his account,
Remarkable Providences (1684), describing in detail he possession of the
children of the Goodwin family of Boston. Mather actually took the
eldest of the children, 13-year-old Martha, into his home to make a more
intense study of the phenomenon. Later scholars have suggested that this
book in fact outlined the symptoms of clinical hysteria. It was this
same hysteria that provided the behavioral model for the circle of
"afflicted" girls during the trials in Salem. Mather, however, used his
experience with Goodwins to further his notion that New England was in
fact a battleground with Satan. Similar themes appear in his sermons and
in the Preface to one of his children's books, in which he warns young
readers: "They which lie, must go to their father, the devil, into
everlasting burning; they which never pray, God will pour out his wrath
upon them; and when they bed and pray in hell fire, God will not forgive
them, but there [they] must lie forever. Are you willing to go to hell
and burn with the devil and his angels?". Thus, the subject of eternal
damnation weighed constantly upon Mather's mind, and it resonates in his
own diary accounts. Scholars suggest that Mather's dramatic descriptions
the devil's activity upon the young Goodwin children may have led to the
first cry of witchcraft among the young girls in Salem Village.</p>

<p>Although Mather was not directly involved in the proceedings of the
Salem witch trials, he wrote a letter to one of the magistrates in the
trials, John Richards of Boston, urging caution in the use of spectral
evidence. Mather was also the author of the "Return of the Several
Ministers," a report sent to the judges of the Salem court. This
carefully-worded document advised caution in the use of spectral
evidence, saying that the devil could indeed assume the shape of an
innocent person, and decrying the use of spectral evidence in the
trials, their "noise, company, and openness", and the utilization of
witch tests such as the recitation of the Lord's Prayer. However, the
final paragraph of the document appears to undercut this cautionary
statement in recommending "the detection of witchcrafts". Thus, in
Bernard Rosenthal and Perry Miller's opinions, the courts interpreted
the letter as Mather's seal of approval for the trials to go on.</p>

<p>Accounts of eye-witnesses and historians paint a more contradictory
portrait of Mather's hand in the trials. Mather is haunted in history by
the account given in Robert Calef's book More Wonders of the Invisible
World (1700) of his conduct at the hanging of former Salem minister
George Burroughs. Calef reported that Burroughs recited a perfect
rendition of the Lord's Prayer while on the gallows, something Mather
himself thought impossible for anyone guilty of an alliance with the
devil. The crowd was so moved that some wanted to prevent the execution.
Mather, mounted on his horse, proclaimed that Burroughs was no ordained
minister, and that the "Devil has often been transformed into an Angel
of Light." With those words, under the tearful gaze of an ambivalent
crowd the George Burroughs was hanged.</p>

<p>Perhaps Cotton's most self-damning act within the public eye was his
publication of the volume The Wonders of the Invisible World, in
October, 1692, after the final executions. Although Cotton's words
describe, and to some degree justify the trials and deaths in Salem that
year, the book is anything but resolved with regards to Mather's true
feelings about the trials. Although Cotton insists the book is not
written in an evil spirit or with any prejudice, he writes of the trials
of accused witches such as Bridget Bishop saying there was "little
occasion to prove witchcraft, it being evident and notorious to all
beholders". He describes Susanna Martin as, "one of the most impudent,
scurrilous, wicked creatures in the world". And worst of all, he
condones the use of the spectral evidence to convict the witches of his
five cases outlined! In his own letter to William Stoughton, penned
during the trial of George Burroughs, Cotton also asserts the guilt of
this man, stating he is the ringleader of 10 other witches, a confession
received from five Andover witches that "refreshes his soul".</p>

<p>Careful analysis of the document, as well as Mather's own diaries,
reveals that he may not have been quite as convinced of the
righteousness of the trials as he describes in his book. A cautious
foreword to the manuscript reads, "I live by Neighbours that force me to
produce these undeserved lines". Perry Miller describes the whole work
as "utter confusion". Robert Calef, author of More Wonders of the
Invisible World, published a very different account than Mather's that
put Cotton on the defensive for the rest of his life. Mather cried libel
and threatened to sue, but the issue was never resolved and Cotton was
forced to bite his tongue and bear what would become a flood of
contemporary scorn for his witch-hunting labors. Near the end of his
life, his diary records a hint of regret for the thanklessness of the
groups he had spurned in his work. He is baffled by why "everybody
points at me, and speaks of me as by far the most afflicted minister in
all New England". Perry Miller describes Cotton's later years as a time
of intense regret and remorse about the trials. He points out that
Cotton's diary paints a picture of a man "panicky lest the Lord take
revenge upon his family 'for [Mather's] not appearing with Vigor enough
to stop the proceedings of the Judges'". Clearly Cotton could not see
his outside of his own world of expectations, reputations, and
contradictions. He died on Feb. 13th 1728 at age 66, survived by only
one of his three wives and two of his fifteen children.</p>

<head><name>Rev. Francis Dane</name></head>

<p>Written By Sara Jobe</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001 </p>

<p>Rev. Francis Dane was born around 1615 in England and died on
February 16, 1697 at the age of eighty-one in Andover, Massachusetts. He
is the son of John Dane, who settled in both Ipswich and Roxbury. Dane's
name is found among the early residents of Ipswich in 1641, and
according to Joseph Felt's History of Ipswich, Dane moved to Andover in
1648. Dane became the second pastor of the North Parish in 1649. He
remained in this position for forty-eight years until his death in 1697.
In regard to his education, Rev. Cotton Mather lists Dane as one of the
young men who finished his studies in the Colony before Harvard College
conferred degrees. In addition to his ministry, Dane founded school for
Andover youth. Dane had two sons, Nathaniel and Francis, and four
daughters, Elizabeth (Johnson), Hannah (Goodhue), Phebe (Robinson), and
Abigail (Faulkner). He himself was married three times: Elizabeth Ingals
(pre 1645-1676), Mary Thomas (1677-1689), and Hannah Abbot (1690-his
death 1697).</p>

<p>Abiel Abbot's History of Andover notes that there is no record of any
discord between Dane and his congregation from 1649 to 1680, although
historian Sarah L. Bailey calls the reality of such a situation into
question in her Historical Sketches of Andover. Whether flawless or not,
it is evident that Dane was a highly respected and powerful member of
the Andover community, comparable only to Dudley Bradstreet, former
Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Around 1680, church members
began to complain about the capabilities of Dane and requested a
younger, more vibrant minister for their church. In January of 1682, the
congregation called the young Rev. Thomas Barnard, a recent graduate of
Harvard and protege of Cotton Mather. Soon thereafter, the congregation
stopped paying Dane's salary and gave Barnard a full salary. Dane
petitioned the General Court in Boston, and the Andover church was
required to pay Dane thirty pounds a year to share pastoral duties with
Barnard. The church decided to pay Barnard fifty pounds a year, which
much less than Barnard expected, with the stipulation that when Dane
retired or died, Barnard would receive the full eighty pounds annual
salary.</p>

<p>Andover church politics were fairly stagnate for the next ten years,
although it appears that the tension between Dane and Barnard was
evident throughout this time. In 1692, however, things started to heat
up when the witch hunt broke out in near by Salem Village. By August,
the hunt had stretched to Andover with an invitation to two of the Salem
accusers to come and find witches in Andover. Rev. Barnard did much to
facilitate the witch hunt, holding prayer meetings in the church that
resulted in "touch tests" where the accusers could simply touch
community members who were then accused of witchery. Rev. Dane refused
to take part in the witch hunt from the outset, and perhaps because of
this as well as the tension between Dane, Bradstreet, and Barnard, more
members of Dane's family were accused than any other single family in
the entire episode. In addition to Dane's extended family, two of Dane's
daughters, his daughter in law, and five of his grandchildren were
accused.</p>

<p>Upham writes, "The Rev. Francis Dane deserves to be recognized
preeminent and for a time almost alone in bold denunciation and
courageous resistance of the expiable proceedings of that dark day."
Dane was the driving force behind ending the trials in Andover. He first
arranged for the Andover children to be let out of jail on bond in
October 1692. Husbands, brothers, and fathers of the accused witches
then joined Dane in petitioning the General Court for the release of the
Andover women on the grounds that they were needed at home and with the
coming of winter would not fare well in the prisons. On October 18,
1692, Dane wrote a petition addressing what he believed to be the forced
and false confessions of guilt made by women during the frenzy of the
"touch test," in order to save themselves from trial and possible
execution. Dane writes that there was, "reason to think that the extreme
urgency that was used with some of them by their friends and others who
privately examined them, and the fear they were then under, hath been an
inducement to them to admit such things." This was the first attempt to
explain the confessions of those who had been accused. Dane also wrote
letters to the courts and his fellow ministers condemning spectral
evidence using such strong language as, "I believe the reports have been
scandalous and unjust, neither will bear y light." Slander charges filed
by Dane and members of his family, particularly Abigail Dane Faulkner,
did much to deter a resurgence of accusations in Andover as well.</p>

<p>Local historian Enders Robinson in his book Salem Witchcraft
concluded from the above facts that the Andover incident was a direct
conspiracy of Barnard against Dane. Although this theory cannot be
proven, and Dane was responsible for halting the Andover proceedings,
Robinson makes an unfounded assumption. Barnard was highly respected and
had studied with Cotton Mather at Harvard. Mather was one of the top
proponents of the trials and the necessity of purging the colony of
witches. Barnard was not the only minister at the time to be lured to
Mather's convincing theological arguments. In Barnard's mind, promoting
the witch trials could very well have been the best thing he could do
for his congregation. One must also note that as Dane's resistance
movement gained momentum, Barnard sided with Dane over the courts.
Robinson believes this to be indicative of Barnard's manipulative
nature. Although this is possible, there is no evidence for Barnard's
motive in changing sides on the witchcraft issue. Regardless of the
social motives behind what occurred in Andover in 1692, Dane immerged as
a fearless and effective leader. He suffered under the accusations of
numerous members of his family, yet found the strength to guide an
entire community through an irrationality that could have lead to many
more innocent deaths had he not taken such an outspoken, controversial,
and admirable stand.</p>

<p>Ann Dolliver was the daughter of Rev. John Higginson of Salem Town
and was unhappily married to Willliam Dolliver of Gloucester. Court
records of 1683 show that complaints were made against William Dolliver
for being idle and neglecting his family. In fact, he left the
Massachusetts Bay Colony, abandoning Ann and her children with no means
of support. Ann was forced to leave Gloucester with her children to
return to her father's home in Salem where he and the town supported
them. She retained her title of respect (Mrs.), but her social standing
was compromised and her mental state soon declined.</p>

<p>Before June 1692 her situation was already on shaky grounds. But on
June 6, when she was about 45 years old, she was arrested for
"Witchcraft on the Bodys of Mary Warren and Susannah Sheldon." Only the
warrant for Dolliver's arrest, the testimony of Elizabeth Nicholson
against Dolliver, and the newly discovered pre-trial examination are
known to scholars today. During her examination, Warren and Sheldon were
present along with Mary Walcott. The examination was conducted on June 6
before Magistgrates Gedney, Hawthorne, and Corwin. Ann Dolliver's
specter was portrayed as a particularly nasty one. The accusers reported
that Dolliver's specter wanted to kill her own father out of spite. They
also said that the specter of a dead child blamed Ann Dolliver for its
murder. When the judges asked Ann if she possessed wax puppets, an
indication of magic that the Puritans regarded as witchcraft, she
replied that she did fourteen years ago, but only "because she thought
she was bewitched and she read in a book: that told her; that that: was
[the] way to afflict: them [that] had afflicted her." In other words,
Ann Dolliver pleaded self-defense. When answering the question, "Mrs
Dolliver did you never act witchcraft," she defended herself and
implicitly confessed at the same time: "not with the intent to hurt
anybody with it." She admitted to having done witchcraft in 1678 to
protect herself and her family, but denied that she afflicted her
accusers in 1692. Lack of further documentation makes determinations
difficult, but it appears that Dolliver was released due to insufficient
evidence or because of her questionable mental condition.</p>

<p>Her life did not improve after the trials ended. In a letter to her
brother written in August 1693 (which, strangely, did not mention the
witch trials), her father, Rev. Higginson, described her as suffering
from "overbaring malloncolly, crazed in her understanding." As of 1705,
she had been declared to be mentally incompetent (non compos mentis) and
remained a dependent of her father.</p>

<p>Scholars do not address Ann Dolliver's case as often as others in the
trials. Carol Karlsen's feminist study, however, examines her case.
According to her analysis, which is based on gender roles in Puritan
society, Ann Dolliver fits a socio-economic profile. While her father
was prominent and wealthy, she was a deserted wife and was utterly
dependent on her father. Caught between being single and being a widow,
her situation was precarious. As such, Dolliver was practically
impoverished at the time of her accusation. Her condition made her
vulnerable to attack because, as a poor woman, the officials would be
less likely to overlook charges launched against her. Also, she did not
have a husband to deflect the charges. Basically, she was a poor and
therefore vulnerable woman. Marshall Swan continues in this vein when he
observes that mentally unstable women were often vulnerable to
accusations of witchcraft at this time.</p>

<p>Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissembaum have a different place for Ann
Dolliver. While she is not explicitly treated in their study, she
cleanly fits their paradigm. They argue that the trials were based on
the Village's anxieties. The more rural Salem Village was engaged in a
struggle to obtain its independence from the prosperous seaport, Salem
Town. Loyalty to the Town church or connections to the emerging
capitalism in the Town represented opposition to this cause. Boyer and
Nissenbaum find that the majority of accusers were connected to the
Village and that the majority of the accused associated with the Town.
Ann Dolliver fits into this scheme because her father was a minister in
Salem Town. Her father had also defended one of the accused witches,
sarah Buckley, thus contradicting the girls' testimony. Ann Dolliver may
therefore hve been targeted as a way of hitting back at her father. Her
strong connections to the Town made her an adequate scapegoat for what
her father represented.</p>

<head><name>Mary Easty</name></head>

<p>Written By Anne Taite Austin</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>Considering the assumption that witchcraft was hereditary, Mary
(Towne) Easty was certain to be accused of witchcraft after her sister,
Rebecca (Towne) Nurse, was condemned for her unwavering appeal of
innocence. Mary Easty was not a member of Salem Town or Village, but a
resident of Topsfield, a settlement just north of the Village. Animosity
had festered between members of Salem Village and Topsfield since 1639
when the General Court of Massachusetts granted Salem permission to
expand northward in the direction of the Ipswich River, but then only
four years later the same court authorized inhabitants of another
Village, Ipswich, to found a settlement there. As land became scarcer,
quarrels regarding boundaries between the settlement to become known as
Topsfield and Salem went on for a century. The Putnams of Salem Village
embodied this battle in their quarrels with the Nurse family, Mary
Easty's brother-in-law. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum in Salem
Possessed, considering the bitterness between these families, it can be
seen as no coincidence that the three Towne sisters, Rebecca Nurse,
Sarah Cloyce and Mary Easty, were all daughters and wives of Topsfield
men eventually to be persecuted by Putnam women in 1692 on behalf of
Putnam men.</p>

<p>More interesting than the accusations against Easty is her experience
during the trials. She was accused on April 21, examined on the 22nd,
and imprisoned after denying her guilt. During her examination,
Magistrate John Hathorne aggressively questioned Easty, or more
accurately, tried to lead her to a confession by the following line of
questioning:</p>

<p>"How can you say you know nothing when you see these tormented
[girls], &amp; accuse you that you know nothing?" "Would you have me
accuse myself?"</p>

<p>"Yes if you be guilty."</p>

<p>"Sir, I never complied but prayed against [the devil] all my dayes...
I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this sin." (SWPI
120)</p>

<p>In a surprising moment, Hathorne, clearly affected by the convincing
manner with which Easty spoke, turned to the accusers and asked, "Are
you certain this is the woman?" This question acted as a symbol for the
accusers to release their full energy into tormented fits. Hathorne was
now convinced and imprisoned Easty. The girls, however, seemed not to be
fully convinced of their own accusations. Perhaps due to pressure from
community around Easty, all of the accusers, except Mercy Lewis, began
to back off their claims and Easty was released from jail on May 18.</p>

<p>The details of what happened next provide undeniable clues about the
power of the accusers and the impossibility of conducting a fair
juridical process. After Easty's release, Mercy Lewis fell into violent
fits and appeared to be approaching death. Mercy Lewis later explained
that Easty was tormenting her, and "said [Easty] would kill [Lewis]
before midnight because she did not cleare hir so as the Rest did."
(Salem Witchcraft Papers, I: 124) Mary Walcott, Abigail Williams and Ann
Putnam were brought to her bedside in an effort to discover who was
tormenting Mercy. Along the path to the Mercy's house, Ann and Abigail
explained that they saw Easty's specter tormenting Mercy, strongly
suggesting a collaboration effort had already taken place before Mercy
began her torments. Frances Hill in A Delusion of Satan calls this
episode a propaganda scheme to show doubting Villagers the dire
consequences of freeing witches from jail. Mercy and four others cried
out against Easty on May 20. Mercy's fits did not cease until Easty was
back in prison in irons demonstrating the effective power of the
accusers.</p>

<p>While Easty remained in jail awaiting her September 9 trial, she and
her sister, Sarah Cloyce, composed a petition to the magistrates in
which they asked, in essence, for a fair trial. They complained that
they were "neither able to plead our owne cause, nor is councell
allowed." They suggested that the judges ought to serve as their counsel
and that they be allowed persons to testify on their behalf. Easty hoped
her good reputation in Topsfield and the words of her minister might aid
her case in Salem, a town of strangers. Lastly, the sisters asked that
the testimony of accusers and other "witches" be dismissed considering
it was predominantly spectral evidence that lacked legality. (Salem
Witchcraft Papers, I: 303) The sisters hoped that the judges would be
forced to weigh solid character testimony against ambiguous spectral
evidence. The petition did not change the outcome of Easty's trial, for
she was condemned to hang on September 17th. But together with her
second petition, Easty had forced the court to consider its flaws.</p>

<p>Easty's second petition was written not as a last attempt to save her
own life but as a plea that "no more innocent blood may be shed." (SWP I
:304) She concedes saying that the court had the best of intentions, but
only more innocent deaths would occur if the court continued its
practices, for she like many others could not "belie [their] own soul."
She proposes two strategies for the court in to use when determining
witchcraft: First, she asks that the accusers be kept apart to see if
under such circumstances they would all tell the same experiences. If
they were able to give similar credible accounts of their spectral
experiences then any doubt would be removed as to the guilt or innocence
of the person on trial. This proposal brings to mind Thomas Brattle's
observation in his famous Letter of October 8, 1692 that the accusers,
when not claiming to be attacked by specters, were otherwise in good
health. Easty was obviously not the only skeptic of the accusers'
spectral torments. Secondly, Easty proposed that all confessing witches
be brought to trial as well as those confessing innocence. Rosenthal
writes in A Salem Story that in an atmosphere of rising doubt, "for the
court to ignore Easty's challenge would be to acknowledge to the critics
that the proceedings were fatally flawed - that the hunt was not really
for witches after all but for validating the court."</p>

<p>Easty was hanged on September 22, 1692. Her demeanor at Gallows Hill
is documented by Calef: "when she took her last farewell of her husband,
children and friends, was, as is reported by them present, as serious,
religious, distinct, and affectionate as could well be exprest, drawing
tears from the eyes of almost all present." Easty challenged the court
to no personal avail, but she exposed the weakness of the court for the
benefit of others.</p>

<head><name>Philip English</name></head>

<p>Philip English is an interesting figure in the Salem witch trials
because his prominence in the community raises questions about the
pattern of accusations; his escape from jail and the gallows provides
insight about the politics behind the trials; and his post-trials
experience highlights how the Colony attempted to rectify the fiscal
wrongs committed against the victims of the trials.</p>

<p>A warrant was issued for English's arrest on April 30 1692, but he
was nowhere to be found, and another warrant had to be issued on May 6.
His wife, Mary, had been taken into custody one week earlier. Facing
indictments from Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon and William Beale, in
late May, Philip finally surfaced from hiding and joined his wife in
John Arnold's jail in Boston, perhaps because his avoidance of the law
was hurting their legal situation. Philip and Mary stayed in Boston for
nine weeks under lenient supervision until the eve of their expected
return to their August trial in Salem. But instead of returning, the
couple escaped to New York where they stayed throughout the duration of
the trials. Men of prominence including Rev. Joshua Moody of Boston,
Governor Phips of Massachusetts and Governor Fletcher of New York
apparently aided the Englishs' escape into safe hands. New York was a
predominantly Dutch settlement, and it was known for its religious
tolerance and disapproval of the proceedings in Salem.</p>

<p>After Governor Phips officially ended the trials in May 1693, Philip
English returned to Salem with his wife in good spirits. But he soon
became disheartened by the pillaging of his wealthy estate at the hands
of Sheriff Corwin and the death of his wife Mary by consumption during
childbirth a year later. English fought through several petitions for
restitution of his estate (which in 1692 included 14 buildings, 21 sail
vessels, a wharf, and a warehouse). He estimated damages of 1,183 pounds
of which he was only awarded 60 during his lifetime and another 200 at
his death. The legality of such land and estate seizures is complex, but
it remains that several authorities including Phips, English's ally,
knew that Essex County Sheriff George Corwin was not forwarding the
money to the colony or the Crown as he claimed. This brief sketch of
Philip English's involvement in the trial raises many questions - one of
course being the reason he was accused - especially considering the fact
that he was allowed to disappear.</p>

<p>The biography of Philip English, born Philippe d'Anglois in 1651,
begins hazily as historians have had little luck discerning his past
before he came to Salem in 1670. Of French Huguenot descent, he
immigrated from the Isle of Jersey into the mercantile class of Salem
town. From this point, historians have had little trouble keeping track
of him because quickly upon his arrival, he established himself as a
successful trading merchant. His success increased when he married Mary,
the only daughter of William Hollingsworth, the head of a prominent
shipping legacy and longstanding family in Salem and Massachusetts. This
brief introduction sets up several characteristics that have been argued
as the root of English's involvement with the witch trials: 1) English
was an immigrant 2) with Protestant tendencies who 3) was successful in
the changing economy of Massachusetts. In sum, English was an outsider
to the community. Despite his involvement within the community on
economic, political and social realms, he existed as an outside threat
to the harmony of the Salem community.</p>

<p>First, he was French, and a Huguenot at that. Bryan F. Le Beau's
essay, "Philip English and the witchcraft hysteria," emphasizes
English's non-Puritan religious background even though he and Mary
attended services and baptized their children at Salem's First Church.
His wife was even admitted into full communion in 1681. Many legends
report English to have been hostile towards the Puritan faith, but
conflict did not arise until long after the trials in 1714 when he gave
money to help erect an Anglican church in a nearby town. At this point
tension arose as English refused to pay his church taxes and as Le
Beau's essay cites, he spoke out feverishly against Rev Noyes, one of
the Puritans ministers during the trials, as having "murdered" John
Proctor and Rebecca Nurse. Although English later rebels against the
Puritan religion, there is no documented basis to believe that he his
religion was an outright problem with the Puritans at the time of the
accusations. Nonetheless, his French Protestant descent made him
different and consequently vulnerable.</p>

<p>English's personal character probably caused more discontent than his
Anglicanism. Having many land parcels in various locations made him
liable to frequent episodes of litigation. The lawsuit brought against
him by William Beale involved a heated debate about the boundaries of a
piece of land in Marblehead. English's open hostility against Beale
would come back to haunt him when Beale accused English's specter of
witchcraft two years later during the trials. English's consistent land
disputes when coupled with the town's prejudice against the superior
style in which his family lived exposed English to a volatile
hostility.</p>

<p>The rich lifestyle of the English's may caused resentment among Salem
villagers, but more accurately, the fact that an Anglican immigrant
merchant could find such spectacular financial success in Salem was
especially disturbing. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum in Salem
Possessed, "if one had to choose the single person most representative
of the economic and social transformations which were overtaking Salem -
and Massachusetts as a whole - in the late seventeenth century, Philip
English might as well be that person." Boyer and Nissenbaum that claim
factions had arisen between Salem Village and Salem based on economic
and political relationship. English was incredibly successful in the
young mercantile industry rather than in farming, and was thus
representative of the new economy that many farmers perceived as a
political threat to the Villagers' desire for independence from Salem
and its accompanying social style. Infuriating the farmers, perhaps,
merchants in Salem were taking prominence in local politics. Philip
English had been appointed as a town's selectman in March of 1692 - one
month before he was accused of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Indeed, English fits into Boyer and Nissenbaum's analysis of the
witch trials as an outgrowth of pre-existing tensions along economic and
political lines, but more broadly, English became a representative of
all that Salem Villagers distrusted: he lived a lavish lifestyle, he was
Anglican, he was an immigrant, he sympathized with other French Huguenot
immigrants, and he was becoming politically active. English would not be
able to escape the accusation, but he was able to escape the gallows.
Historians do know that higher political authorities such as Governor
Phips was an ally of English in his escape and in the restitution of his
estate, so perhaps his powerful allies made it futile to go after
English. Since I believe English was targeted as a threat to the
agrarian community, perhaps the stripping of his lucrative estate and
his complete absence from the town were sufficient to satisfy the
accusers' goals.</p>

<p>Elizabeth (Betty) Parris was nine years old when the witchcraft
epidemic broke out in Salem, and she actively participated in its
beginning. Elizabeth, a sweet girl, had difficulty facing the stark
realities of predestination and damnation that her father, Reverend
Samuel Parris, preached to her. Elizabeth Parris lived in a period of
economic uncertainty and yearned to know what lay in her future.</p>

<p>In the dark winter days of 1691, Elizabeth Parris and her cousin
Abigail Williams began to undertake experiments in fortune telling,
using a device known as a "venus glass." A venus glass consists of an
egg white suspended in water in which one could see shapes and figures.
The girls mainly focused on their future social status, and specifically
on the trade in which their husbands would be employed. These fortune
telling secrets were shared with other young girls in the area. On one
occasion, the glass revealed the horrendous specter of a coffin, which,
as Rev. John Hale reported in A Modest Inquiry into the Nature of
Witchcraft, (1702) led to "diabolical molestation.". And it is out of
these childish beginnings that the Salem witchcraft outbreak began.</p>

<p>Betty Parris' afflictions started innocently in January when she
began to forget errands, was unable to concentrate, and seemed rapt in
secret preoccupation. She could not concentrate at prayer time and
barked like a dog when her father would rebuke her. She screamed wildly
when she heard the "Our Father" prayer and once hurled a Bible across
the room. After these episodes, she sobbed distractedly and spoke of
being damned. She seemed to see damnation as inevitable, perhaps because
of her practicing fortune telling, which was regarded as a demonic
activity.. Reverend Samuel Parris believed that prayer could cure her
odd behavior, but his efforts were ineffective.</p>

<p>Nobody knows precisely what the Betty Parris and her girls friends
were experiencing, but it manifested itself as odd postures, foolish and
ridiculous speech, distempers, and fits. John Hale in A Modest Inquiry
described the affliction that the girls suffered by saying they looked
as if they "were bitten and pinched by invisible agents; their arms,
necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back again,
so as it was impossible for them to do of themselves, and beyond the
power of Epileptick fits, or natural disease to effect. Sometimes they
were taken dumb, their mouths stopped, their throats choked, their limbs
wracked and tormented so as might move a heart of stone to sympathize
with them." The local physician, William Griggs, diagnosed Elizabeth
Parris as being afflicted by the "Evil Hand," commonly known as
witchcraft. Rev. Samuel Parris thought it was "a very sore rebuke and
humbling providence that the Lord ordered the horrid calamity to break
out first in [his] family." Since the sufferers of witchcraft were
believed to be the victims of a crime, the community set out to find the
perpetrators.</p>

<p>On February 29, 1692, under intense adult questioning, the afflicted
girls named Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba as their tormentors.
Elizabeth Parris testified at these trials that she was tormented by
spectral visions of these women. During their trials, Elizabeth would
cry out when the accused moved her arms, legs, or head, as if the
accused was injuring her from across the room. Elizabeth Parris was also
involved in the conviction of Martha Corey. At Martha Corey's trial, the
afflicted girls sat together, and what Martha did, they all did. If she
shifted her feet they did so too, and fell to stamping their feet. If
she bit her lips, they yelled that she had bitten theirs, and showed the
magistrates tht they bled." .</p>

<p>Understandably, Mrs. Parris was worried about the health of her
daughter and she protested against using her as a witch finder. At the
end of March, Betty was sent to live with Rev. Samuel Parris' distant
cousin, Stephen Sewall, in Salem. This technique of isolation stopped
most of her symptoms, but she still had visions after leaving the Parris
household. On March 25, Elizabeth "related that the great Black Man came
to her, and told her, if she would be ruled by him, she should have
whatsoever she desired, and go to a Golden City" (Lawson). Mrs. Sewall
told Elizabeth that it had been the Devil who had approached her "and he
was a Lyar from the Beginning, and bid her tell him so, if he came
again: which she did" (Lawson).</p>

<p>In 1710, Elizabeth Parris finally found the answer to the question
she had been searching for in her homemade crystal ball. She married
Benjamin Baron, a yeoman, trader, cordwainer, and shoemaker, in Sudbury
and led a very ordinary existence. She and Benjamin bore four children,
Thomas, Elizabeth Jr., Catherine, and Susanna. Elizabeth Parris survived
her husband by six years, succumbing to illness in their Concord home on
March 21, 1760 (Marilyn Roach).</p>

<head><name>Giles Corey</name></head>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Born in England about 1611, Giles Corey was one of the six men to be
executed during the Salem witch trials of 1692. John Proctor, George
Burroughs, George Jacobs Sr., John Willard, and Samuel Wardwell were all
hanged after being convicted of witchcraft, while Giles Corey was
pressed to death with stones for refusing to "put himself on the
country," that is, to allow himself to be put on trial. He emigrated
from England to Salem and remained there until 1659 when he relocated to
Salem Farms, just south of Salem Village. There he owned an extensive
plot of land, which resulted in the appearance of his being a prosperous
farmer. His personality, reputation and relationships with others
however tainted that picture. Although he had become a full member of
the Village church and had close ties with the Porter faction in the
Village, his reputation as one who lacked consideration for others in
the community and as one who lead a "scandalous life," quite possibly
had a significant impact on his being accused as a witch. Because of
Corey's previous encounters with the law, there was further suspicion of
his guilt during the witch trials. In 1675, Corey pummeled and killed a
farm worker named Jacob Goodale. He was found guilty of the murder and
ordered to pay a substantial fine.</p>

<p>By the time of the trials, Giles Corey was already 80, and was
married to Martha, his third wife. On March 19, 1692, Martha was
arrested for witchcraft. Giles, for reasons unknown to others, decided
to testify against his wife, but eventually tried to recant his
deposition, which lead to greater suspicion of his involvement in
witchcraft because of the stigma surrounding perjury. One month later,
on April 19, 1692, Giles Corey was accused of witchcraft and there was a
warrant out for his arrest. There were two primary accusations, one from
Abigail Hobbs who during her own confession to witchcraft named Giles
and Martha Corey as fellow witches, and one from Exekiell Chevers and
John Putnam, Jr., who filed an accusation on behalf of Ann Putnam, Marcy
Lewis, Abigail Williams, Mary Walcott and Elizabeth Hubbard.</p>

<p>After his arrest, Giles Corey remained in jail with his wife until
his trial on September 16, 1692. He went to the trial and pleaded "not
guilty" but simultaneously refused to "put himself on the court" because
of his contempt for the court. Corey was not willing to submit himself
to a trial by jury that, he believed, had already determined his guilt.
Because the court had accepted the testimony of the same accusers in a
trial on September 9, and in all previous trials, Giles understood that
there was no chance of being found not guilty and that a conviction
would be inevitable. In every previous trial when an accused individual
had plead not guilty, not a single person was cleared so Giles preferred
to undergo "what Death they would put him to" rather than be found
guilty of witchcraft and thus put to death. According to English law,
Giles was ruled as "standing mute" because he would not be tried by "God
and my country." The Court of Oyer and Terminer strictly adhered to the
requirement that a defendant "put himself on the country". Because Giles
stood mute, he was given the dreaded sentence of peine forte et dure
even though this procedure had been determined to be illegal by the
government of Massachusetts. It was illegal for two reasons: there was
no law permitting pressing, and it violated the Puritan provisions of
the Body of Liberties regarding the end of barbarous punishment. In the
entire history of the United States, Giles Corey is the only person ever
to be pressed to death by order of a court.</p>

<p>There is a strong local tradition Giles Corey refused trial in order
to avoid a conviction that would result in the forfeiture of his
property to the government. Under English and Massachusetts law,
however, conviction could not result in the forfeiture of an estate.
However, the George Corwin, the Sheriff of Essex Country illegally
seized the property of some of those arrested for witchcraft. Before his
arrest, Corey himself was clearly concerned about his extensive estate,
and he wrote a will that deeded his land to his sons-in-law William
Cleeves and John Moulton. The laws clearly stated that landowners
retained the right to give their land to their heirs rather than forfeit
it because of a conviction, and apparently Corey knew it. Thus it does
not seem likely that Corey refused to go on trial to save his
property.</p>

<p>On or before September 18, 1692, Giles Corey was slowly pressed to
death in the field next to the jail. In the literature about Giles
Corey's tortuous death, there is reference to his famous last words,
"more weight." These words were uttered as a final attempt to expedite
his death while also showing that not even imminent death could convince
him to go to trial. It is even told that the Sheriff took his cane and
pressed Giles' tongue back into his mouth just before he died at the end
of the two days of being slowly crushed. On September 18, 1692, Giles
Corey was ex-communicated from the Village church so that he would not
die as a member of the church. On September 21, 1692, Martha, his wife,
was hanged on Gallows Hill. It has been speculated that the publicity
surrounding the pressing of Giles may have in fact helped to build
public opposition to the witchcraft trials.</p>

<p>In Arthur Miller's, The Crucible, Giles Corey is a prominent
character in part because of his unique role in the witch trials. Giles'
colorful past, his willingness to be tortured before compromising his
own values, and his role in his wife's conviction are the factors which
make him such a vibrant character. Although Millers' presentation of
Giles Corey in The Crucibleis not purely historical, his place in the
witch trials will never be forgotten. Giles Corey did in fact testify
against his wife in front of the court, and he seems to have stood mute
as an act of dramatic defiance. Henry W. Longfellow's Giles Corey of
Salem Farms is another piece of literature that portrays Giles Corey in
a strong and powerful manner. In his play, Corey's character is defined
by his last conversation with his friend Capt. Richard Gardner. In the
play, Giles Corey says: "I will not plead. If I deny, I am condemned
already, in courts where ghosts appear as witnesses, and swear men's
lives away. If I confess, then I confess to a lie, to buy a life which
is not a life, but only death in life. I will not bear false witness
against any, Not even against myself, whom I count least...I come! Here
is my body; ye may torture it, but the immortal soul ye cannot
crush!"</p>

<p>This passage shows why the character of Giles Corey attracts
attention not only when examining court documents from 1692 but also the
present day literature. Giles Corey will be remembered unambiguously in
literature and history because of his act of supreme defiance to the
Salem witch trials.</p>

<head><name>Sarah Good</name></head>

<p>Written By Sara Jobe</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Sarah Good was born in 1653 to a well off innkeeper named John
Solart. However, her father's estate was tied up in litigation that left
Good virtually nothing. Her first marriage was to a poor indentured
servant named Daniel Poole who died in debt in 1686. Her second marriage
to William Good was doomed from the outset because the couple had to pay
for the debts of first husband Poole. The Goods were homeless, renting
rooms in other people's houses, and they had two young children. William
worked as a laborer around Salem Village in exchange for food and
lodging, but it became increasingly difficult for the family to find a
place to stay as Sarah's reputation for and being socially unpleasant
spread throughout the town. The family was regarded as a nuisance to the
town, and by 1692 they were virtually beggars.</p>

<p>Good's position as a disreputable and marginal member of society made
her a perfect candidate for witchcraft accusations. On February 29,
1692, the first warrant was issued for the arrest of Sarah Good, Sarah
Osborne, and Tituba. The three were accused initially of afflicting
Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, and later many other accusers came
forward to testify about injurious actions and spectral evidence against
Good. Good was the first to testify in the Salem Witchcraft trials, and
Bernard Rosenthal in Salem Story asserts that Good was specifically
chosen to start the trials off because most people were in support of
ridding Salem Village of her presence. Even her six-year-old daughter
Dorcas was frightened into testifying against her, and although her
husband did not call her a witch, he said that he, too, had reason to
believe she was close to becoming one, thus, perhaps, protecting himself
from accusation. One of Good's trial records quotes William Good as
saying, "it was her bad carriage to [me] and indeed say I with tears
that she is enemy to all good." Despite the overwhelming sentiment
against her, Good adamantly denied Magistrate John Hathorne's
accusations. When Hathorne in the pre-trial hearings asked, "Why do you
hurt these children?" Good responded, "I do not hurt them. I scorn it."
She also stated repeatedly, "I am falsely accused."</p>

<p>Although Good never confessed, she did accuse Sarah Osborne of
afflicting the girls after witnessing the accusers fall down in fits in
the courtroom. Historians generally agree that this accusation by Good
was one of the first and strongest legitimizations of the witchcraft
trials. Only one person came forth to defend Good. When one of the girls
accused Good of stabbing her with a knife and produced a broken knife
tip to prove it, a man came forward showing that it was his knife from
which the tip had been broken in the presence of the accusing girl. Far
from invalidating the girl's testimony against Good, Judge Stoughton
simply asked the girl to continue with her accusations with a reminder
to stick to the facts.</p>

<p>Good was condemned to hang but was pardoned until the birth of her
child. Her daughter Dorcas was accused of witchery and was imprisoned
for over seven months. Although the child of six years was eventually
released on bond, she was psychologically damaged for the rest of her
life. Good's infant died in prison with her before Good was hanged. Her
execution occurred on Tuesday July 19, 1692. According to local
tradition, when Good stood at the gallows prepared to die she was asked
once more by Rev. Nicholas Noyes, assistant minister in the Salem
church, to confess and thus save her immortal soul. Far from confessing,
Good is said to have screamed, "You're a liar! I'm no more a witch than
you are a wizard! If you take my life away, God will give you blood to
drink!" It was this constant refusal to confess that Bernard Rosenthal
believes led Good to the Gallows, even more so than all of the
accusations against her.</p>

<p>The way in which Good has been portrayed in literature is worth
mentioning because it sheds light upon how the Salem Witch Trials have
been popularly imagined and how the accused witches were and are viewed
today. Good is always depicted as an old hag with white hair and
wrinkled skin. She is often said to be sixty or seventy years of age by
the same writers who clearly state that she was pregnant and had a
six-year-old daughter. Even accounts from Salem Villagers and
magistrates at the time refer to her as an old nuisance, hag, and
bed-ridden. How did such a misconception arise? Perhaps her hard life
did have such a physical effect on Good that she did appear extremely
aged. On the other hand, witches are described in literature then and
now as being old wicked women. If Good was to represent the typical
witch worthy of execution, then it is not surprising that all of the
stereotypes would be accordingly attached. Good was a marginal woman and
no doubt a nuisance to her neighbors. However, the Salem trials were
conducted unfairly, with a presumption of guilt, and little evidence.
Marginality is not worthy of hanging, and Good was never proved to be
nor did she confess to be a witch.</p>

<p>Written By Kristin Buckstad</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was born ca. 1620. Not much is known about when he
came to Massachusetts Bay Colony, or about his first wife. He had three
children from his first marriage, all born in Salem. George Jr. (b. ca.
1649), Mary (b. ca. 1650), and Ann (b. ca. 1655). He bought land in
Salem around 1658 and married his second wife, Mary, about 1673. He had
lived in Salem for a little over thirty years when he was accused of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was arrested on May 10, 1692, along with his
granddaughter Margaret Jacobs. He was examined twice, on the day of his
arrest and on the following day. His trial took place in early August,
and he remained in prison from the time of his arrest until his
execution on August 19.</p>

<p>His primary accuser was Sarah Churchill, who was a servant in his
home. She came from a wealthy family of English gentry in Maine but was
most likely orphaned in Indian Wars. She, like Margaret, had been
accused of witchcraft and, in her confession, accused others. George
Jacobs granddaughter Margaret herself confessed to witchcraft and
accused her grandfather among others who had already been accused in
order, she wrote, "to save my life and to have my liberty." The list of
accusers against Jacobs did not end there. It swelled to include Abigail
Williams, Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis, Elizabeth Hubbard, Mary Walcott,
Sarah Bibber, Mary Warren, Joseph Flint, Thomas Putnam, John Putnam,
Jr., and John DeRich.</p>

<p>The women accused his Jacobs' specter of beating them with his
walking stick and other physical abuses. Not only did the women testify
that Jacobs afflicted them, they also testified to witnessing the
afflictions of the others. During his testimony, John DeRich, a
sixteen-year old boy, was the only person to claim that Jacobs afflicted
him. The Putnam men testified that they witnessed the afflictions that
Mary Walcott and the other women suffered on May 11 at the hands of
Jacobs' specter.</p>

<p>The Puritans believed that witches and wizards had proof of their
covenants with the Devil on their bodies. Doctor George Herrick was sent
to examine Jacobs' body for the witch's "teat," and found one on his
right shoulder. This slight protuberance on his skin combined with the
spectral evidence made the case strong enough for indictment.</p>

<p>George Jacobs, Sr. emerges as an interesting person from the records
of his examinations on May 10 and 11. He was incredulous from the moment
the first accuser, Abigail Williams, cried out against him. He laughed
in court, always a risky response and said: "Because I am falsely
accused.-Your worships all of you do think this is true?" One of his
most famous protest was the defiant assertion, "You tax me for a wizard,
you may as well tax me for a buzzard I have done no harm." Emphatically
portraying his unwavering Christian faith, he declared, "Well: burn me,
or hang me, I will stand in the truth of Christ, I know nothing of it."
Several times he argued that "The Devill can go in any shape" or "can
take any likeness." This was sound theological doctrine at the time,
warning the court that it was doing the Devil's work by accusing
innocent people. The judges, however, believed that the Devil cannot
take a person's form "without [his] consent."</p>

<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was then indicted, tried, and found guilty of
witchcraft. He was hanged on August 19, 1692 with George Burroughs, John
Proctor, John Willard, and Martha Carrier. This was the first time men
were executed as witches in Salem. Meanwhile, Jacobs' granddaughter
Margaret Jacobs was free from danger after confessing and accusing her
grandfather but remained in jail. Her father, George Jacobs, Jr., was
also accused but fled from Salem Town. When he did so, he left behind
his wife, Rebecca, in jail facing witchcraft charges. She became
severely emotionally disturbed and was most likely ruled mentally
incompetent and escaped conviction. George Sr.'s second wife, Mary,
survived him and remarried on June 23, 1693 to John Wilds whose wife had
been hanged as a witch on July 19, 1692. Jacobs body was retrieved from
Gallows Hill by his family and buried on his land. In the 1980's his
body had to be moved quickly, due to the sale of the Jacobs family
property,. His bones were kept in storage in the Danvers Archive until
1992 when he was finally put to rest in the Rebecca Nurse Cemetery.</p>

<p>George Jacobs, Sr.'s role in the witch trials has been interpreted in
several ways. Bernard Rosenthal views him as the victim of fabrication.
For example, Ann Putnam and Abigail Williams knowingly put pins in their
hands and accused his specter of putting them there to add to evidence
against him (Salem Story). He was also a victim of the life-saving
strategy that the accused learned during the early course of the trials:
confess and your life will be spared. Two of his primary accusers were
among the accused who confessed to save themselves..</p>

<p>Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum interpret the trials in
socio-economic and political terms. They argue that many members of the
more rural and agricultural Salem Village (e.g. the Putnam family) were
threatened by those with economic and political connections to Salem
Town (e.g. the Porter family), the seaport and center of emerging
capitalism. Salem Village had been trying to assert its independence
from the Town by establishing its own church, and inhabitants of the
Village with ties to the Town were seen as threats to the cause of
Village independence. As such, the majority of accusers was from the
Village and the majority of the accused who lived on the western side of
the Village nearer to the Town. George Jacobs, Sr.'s son, George, was
good friend of the Porters, making the family vulnerable to accusations,
particularly from the Putnams. The phenomenon of the accused becoming
accusers was due, they argue, to the swarm of accusations made in the
heat of politics and economics. Eventually the confusion had to fall
back on itself.</p>

<p>Carol Karlsen offers a more gender-oriented analysis. The "possessed
accusers" were usually subordinate members of society such as servants.
Many of them, like Sarah Churchill, were orphans. Their prospects for
improving their social standings were virtually nonexistent since they
had no families and no dowries to support them. Totally dependent upon
the will of others, their discontent and anxiety would have been quite
marked. Puritan society, however, did not tolerate socially aggressive
and assertive women. Their fears were then converted, psychologically,
into the belief that they were either witches or were possessed. After
all, Carol Karlsen argues, a society that teaches the existence of
possession will invariably contain persons who think they are possessed
and are believed to be so by others. As for the specific reason that
Sarah Churchill accused George Jacobs, he may have been seen as a
tormentor or harsh master since most of the accusations contained
charges of physical abuse.</p>

<p>All of these explanations fall short, however. None of them explains
why Jacobs own granddaughter would accuse him of all people or why such
a large number of accusations flew at Jacobs, except for the fact that
he publicly denounced the circle of "afflicted" girls, thus opening them
to charges of fraud and compliance with the Devil. If modern students
and scholars find it hard to explain why so many people would spend
their time accusing a 70 year-old man, it is quite easy to see why
George Jacobs, Sr. laughed and told the judges that he could not believe
this was happening.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hubbard was one of the original girls to begin the
witchcraft accusations, and she continued to be a leading accuser
throughout the summer and fall of 1692. Although little is known about
Elizabeth, her name has stood out through history due to her violent
fits under the affliction of the "witches" and her active role as an
accuser.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, like most of the other afflicted girls, was detached from
her parents and family of birth. She went to Salem to live with her
great-aunt Rachel Hubbard Griggs and her husband, the town physician Dr.
William Griggs who diagnosed the original girls as being under the
affliction of an "Evil Hand". As a physician Dr. Griggs and his wife
were viewed as a family of social standing. But Elizabeth was known as a
servant to the household and not as an adopted daughter.</p>

<p>In 1692 Elizabeth was around 17 years old, making her one of the
oldest of the original set of afflicted girls. Along with Elizabeth
Parris, Abby Williams and Anne Putnam, Elizabeth started the accusations
with claims of being tortured by specters of certain members of the
community. The reasons behind the start of the accusations are somewhat
unclear. There are many theories of why the young girls accused people
of witchcraft ranging from the hysteria to the social and economic set
up of the village of the time. In The Devil in the Shape of a Woman,
Carol Karlsen researched some of the accusing girls and suggests that
they may have behaved as they did due to the fact that many of them felt
that their future was uncertain. As orphans, society looked at them in a
different light. Most of the girls had no monetary or emotional support
from direct family members. As Karlsen states, that the frontier wars,
"had left their father's estates considerably diminished, if not
virtually destroyed. Little if anything remained for their dowries. With
few men interested in women without dowries, the marriage prospects of
these women, and thus their long-term material well being, looked
especially grim (227)". Elizabeth Hubbard, like most of the other
accusing girls, was a servant with very dismal if any prospects for the
future. Karlsen goes on to suggest the afflicted were able to use their
dramatic possession performances to "focus the communities' concern on
their difficulties". This was the one situation in which Elizabeth
Hubbard and the others accusing girls had the respect and attention of
the community. Karlsen thinks that this was the girls way of dealing
with the oppression they felt as orphans within Puritan society
(226-230). We can never know exactly why Elizabeth Hubbard accused so
many people of witchcraft but from the documents we can read some of her
testimony and draw conclusions about the kind of girl she was.</p>

<p>By the end of the trial Elizabeth Hubbard had testified against
twenty-nine people, seventeen of whom were arrested, thirteen of those
were hanged and two died in jail. As a strong force behind the trials,
she was able to manipulate both people and the court into believing her.
One way she and the other girls did this was through their outrageous
fits in the courtroom. The fits, they would claim, were brought on by
the accused. Elizabeth was especially known for her trances. She spent
the whole of Elizabeth Procter's trial in a deep trance and was unable
to speak. The original documents state that Elizabeth testified that in
April 1692 "I saw the Apperishtion of Elizabeth procktor the wife of
john procktor sen'r and she immediately tortor me most greviously all
most redy to choak me to death....and so she continewed afflecting of me
by times till the day of hir examination being the IIth of April and
then also I was tortured most greviously during the time of hir
examination I could not spake a word and also severall times sence the
Apperishtion of Elizabeth procktor has tortured me most greviously by
biting pinching and allmost choaking me to death urging me dreadfully to
writ in hir [devil's] book" (Salem Witchcraft Papers). At the trials in
which she was able to speak, she usually charged the accused with pretty
much the same thing. An example is the case of Sarah Good. She testified
"I saw the apprehension of Sarah Good who did most greviously afflect me
by pinching and pricking me and so she continuewed and then she did also
most greviously afflecct and tortor me also during the time of her
examination and also severall times sence hath afflected me and urged me
to writ in her book." This type of spectral accusation was typical of
all the girls. Elizabeth's used it against the twenty-nine people.</p>

<p>However, some witnesses came forward and testified against the
character of aggressive Elizabeth. She was not charged as a witch but
James Kettle and Clement Coldum both took the stand and attempted to
show that Elizabeth was religiously deviant. Coldum stated that one
night when he was taking Elizabeth home form church on his horse "she
desired me to ride faster, I asked why; she said the woods were full of
Devils, &amp; said ther &amp; there they be, but I could se none; then I
put on my horse, &amp; after I had rid a while, she told me I might ride
softer, for we had out rid them. I asked her is she was not afraid of
the Devil, she answered me no, she could discourse with the Devil as
well as with me, &amp; further saith not; this I am ready to testifie on
Oath if called thereto, as witness my hand." Elizabeth was a girl with a
vivid and powerful imagination. However, the fact that she was not
afraid to speak about her relationship with devil is also intriguing
since by May 29th (the date Coldum claimed the event took place) she had
already begun to help to condemn people for committing witchcraft and
conspiring with the Devil. Another member of the village, James Kettle,
stated that Elizabeth "speack severall untruths in denying the sabath
day and saying she had not ben to [church] meeting that day but had only
bean up to James houltons this I can testifie to if called: as witnes my
hand." He seems to be trying to infer that Elizabeth may not be as pious
as others had seen her. However, statements such as this did not
discredit Elizabeth as a truthful witness to the court. She continued
throughout the entire trials to be a leading accuser.</p>

<p>The combination of a lonely upbringing in which there was little hope
for a future and Elizabeth's vivid imagination and fascination with the
devil contributed to her actions which lead to the unjustified
executions of many. Nothing is known of what happened to Elizabeth
Hubbard after the trials were over.</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>Increase Mather was born on June 21, 1639 to Richard and Katherine
Mather. He and four of his five brothers would follow Richard's call to
guide the morality and spirituality of their fellow man, even as the
family ventured with other Puritans to New England in the seventeenth
century. There the Mathers settled, as Richard took up his ministry in
Dorchester just south of Boston.</p>

<p>Increase graduated from Harvard College in 1656, an institution to
which he would return as its President. His son, Cotton Mather was born
into the third generation of Puritan Mather ministers, and after
following in father's footsteps by studying at Harvard, Cotton would
join his father as a leader in the Boston religious establishment.</p>

<p>In February 1674, Increase Mather delivered a sermon, entitled "The
Day of Trouble is Near", the first of many great speeches to the
faithful that would make him an influential Puritan leader in Boston and
across the growing Massachusetts Bay Colony. By 1680-1681, Increase
Mather had "established himself as the conservative champion of the New
England church." His predominant role in Puritan society would call him
across the ocean, as turbulent events in England led to the revocation
of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's charter. Between 1688 and 1692,
Increase Mather was in England advocating on behalf of the colony.</p>

<p>Mather returned to New England on May 14, 1692 with not simply a new
charter, but also a new Governor, Sir William Phips. Increase Mather
played a crucial role in securing Phips' appointment by the Crown, and
therefore the Governor was indebted to him for his position.</p>

<p>When Mather and Phips arrived in Boston, events in Salem Village had
already begun to swirl beyond the confines of that small community. The
jails were beginning to fill with the accused witches, and interim
Governor Bradstreet had kept courts from sitting in trial. The new
Governor, empowered by a new charter, looked to clear the judicial
backlog and established the special Court of Oyer and Terminer to "hear
and determine" the witchcraft cases. On May 27, 1692 the Court was
established, and Bridget Bishop was the first to be executed on Gallows
Hill in Salem exactly two weeks later on June 10.</p>

<p>Governor Phips, apparently surprised at the speed and force which his
actions had begun to unleash, looked to Increase Mather and other
notable Boston ministers for guidance. Increase signed onto "The Return
of Several Ministers," written by his son, Cotton Mather, which put the
Boston ministers on record urging caution in the use of spectral
evidence in the Salem court. Pre-occupied with preparations for an
expedition to fight Indian forces in Maine, Phips did not pay sufficient
attention to the mounting number of arrests and executions ordered by
the Salem court, before he left Boston for Maine in mid-August 1692.
With Phips went Increase Mather's highest patron in civil government and
any hopes he might have had of restraining the court in Salem.</p>

<p>As June stretched into July, the pace of arrests, examinations, and
imprisonments only quickened leading to the execution of five women on
July 19. On July 31, Increase delivered a sermon at Simon Willard's
Third Church in Boston in which he posed the question to the
congregation: "O what makes the difference between the devils in hell
and the angels of heaven?" Mather answered that the quality of holiness
distinguished an angel in heaven from the devils below, and in doing so
he "focused responsibility on the people of New England at large, and
yet looked to individuals for the means to solve the problem. It
encouraged the individual believer to attend to the state of his or her
own soul regardless of what might be happening in the world." (Peterson,
93). The impact of such words from a Boston pulpit on views of the
witchcraft problem is indirect, but clear nonetheless. Mather advised
the congregation that they should focus their attention on their own
shortcomings and not those that they saw in their neighbors and friends.
Still, this was not a clear message to halt the trials, and they
continued unabated in Salem.</p>

<p>Increase Mather attended only one trial in Salem, that of George
Burroughs, Jr., and he seems to have fully agreed with the result.
Bernard Rosenthal in his Salem Story focuses attention on the seeming
contradiction between Increase Mather's overall opposition to the
Court's methods and his support for the same methods in the case of Mr.
Burroughs. Rosenthal writes that, "Burroughs, as a dissenting minister,
offered so powerful a symbol of lost Puritan power that such moderate
and influential ministers as Increase and Cotton Mather lost their way
in confronting his case." Contradictions such as this continue to haunt
comments on Mather by scholars of the period.</p>

<p>By late September 1692, the witchcraft trials had truly reached an
hysterical pitch. Nineteen had been hanged, and Giles Cory had been
tortured to death for refusing to enter a plea. Scores of people
languished in the jails awaiting trial on the charges against them.</p>

<p>In Cases of Conscience Increase Mather forcefully related his
distrust of spectral evidence to convict witches. He argued that it
would be better that ten witches go free than the blood of a single
innocent be shed. One Mather biographer wrote that, "No zeal to stamp
out crimes ever drove him from his belief that, whatever the fate of the
guilty, the innocent must never be in peril." His strong words of
disapproval for spectral evidence so prominently used by the Court of
Oyer and Terminer ended the trials after the directive from Governor
Phips at the end of October, recently returned from his expedition in
Maine.</p>

<p>Cases of Conscience, however, is not without its flaws, the chief one
being Mather's attempt to absolve the judges of Salem of any wrongdoing
and to praise them for their work. Bernard Rosenthal writes that,
"Indeed, when the witch trials ended, he damned the prosecution and
justified the prosecutors." Perry Miller, more forcefully, writes that
"Without the postscript, Cases of Conscience would be a bold stroke;
with it, the book is a miserable species of double-talk." Kenneth
Murdock offers a more balanced approach when he writes of Mather's
postscript, "Less could hardly be said in fairness. More approval of the
trials Mather never expressed."</p>

<p>Increase Mather has been criticized for his delay in putting his
considerable moral authority against the trials, but it would seem that
from his endorsement of "The Return of the Ministers" through his own
Cases of Conscience, Mather was continually seeking to lend caution to
the hysteria without undermining the tenuous framework of the Puritan
government in Boston and Salem. Others have criticized Mather for his
seeming duplicity, in excoriating the trials in general but supporting
that of Burroughs or in deriding the conduct of the Court but praising
its overseers. It is important to note, as many have done, that Increase
Mather very much believed in the evils and dangers of witchcraft and had
no doubt that if the handiwork of the devil was proven, a Puritan
society should "suffer no witch to live." Mather may very well have
thought George Burroughs was a witch and been satisfied to hear of his
hanging in August 1692. He likely admired to some degree the tenacity
with which the Court of Oyer and Terminer took to the task of defending
the covenanted community of the Massachusetts Bay from the devil.</p>

<p>Increase Mather, however, understood that innocent blood was being
shed, and that the Salem court ran rampant without concern for the
advice of the clerical guides, an unprecedented development in the
Puritan Colony. In the witchcraft trials that grew out of the supposed
afflictions of young girls in Salem Village, Mather may also have seen
the symptoms of a fundamentally changing Puritan world. He was caught in
the middle of it, along with the rest of New England, and no doubt
agreed with his friend Thomas Brattle that, "ages will not wear off that
reproach and those stains which these things will leave behind them upon
our land."</p>

<head><name>John Hathorne</name></head>

<p>By Devan Kirk</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>On August 5, 1641, John Hathorne was born into a community that could
have little suspected his future role in the condemnation and death of
so many people. His prominent ancestry in Salem led him to acquire
positions of justice of the peace and county judge. As a religious man
in a highly religious community, Hathorne, like others, believed that
the devil had the power to influence people to do harm in the community
and in the church. Hathorne allowed his strong, unexamined, beliefs to
influence him during his time as judge in the Salem Witchcraft Trials,
thus making him take on an avid prosecutorial style and an assumption of
guilt of most of those who answered his questions.</p>

<p>Usually, Hathorne began his questioning in an accusatory tone, and he
would then proceed to badger the accused in an attempt to drive out a
confession and, better yet, more accusations. Although these methods
were a departure from tradition, Hathorne used them throughout the
trials. One classic example of Hathorne at work as a judge is the
examination of Rebecca Nurse. He begins not by asking Nurse if she is
guilty or innocent, but by asking the afflicted if Nurse afflicts them.
He then asks Rebecca, "here are two An: Putman the child &amp; Abigail
Williams complains of your hurting them What do you say to it" and Nurse
replies that she is innocent." Hathorne, of course, does not let it rest
at that. He continues, "Here is never a one in the Assembly but desires
it, but if you be guilty Pray God discover you" and then allows the
people in the room to stand and testify as to how Nurse afflicted each
of them, relentlessly asking Rebecca after each how and if she denies
them. He persists, asking, "You see these accuse you, is it true?" in
response to which Nurse states "No," but, not being the answer that
Hathorne desired he asks again, "Are you an innocent person relating to
this Witchcraft." Hathorne then continued to allow the accusations of
others to be heard until Rebecca Nurse cried, "Oh Lord help me, &amp;
spread out her hands, &amp; the afflicted were grievously vexed" to
which Hathorne replies in his usual accusatory manner, "Do you not see
what a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are loose the
persons are afflicted." Frustrated by her continued claim of innocence,
Hathorne states, "It is very awful to all to see these agonies &amp; you
an old Professor [believer] thus charged with contracting with the Devil
by the [a] effects of it &amp; yet to see you stand with dry eyes when
there are so many whet" to which Rebecca Nurse courageously asserts "You
do not know my heart." It is here that Hathorne slips in his composure
and openly states, "You would do well if you are guilty to confess &amp;
give Glory to God" - thus showing his already formed opinion as to her
guilt and his preference for confessions. The questioning then continues
and Hathorne switches into a new mode and attempts to trick Nurse into
confessing, "Possibly you [Nurse] may apprehend you are no witch, but
have you not been led aside by temptations that way" for, if Nurse
confessed to either, she would be confessing at least to the practice of
witchcraft still, and could still be punished. Again the badgering by
Hathorne continued until finally Nurse asked a revealing question to
which she received no answer, "Would you [Hathorne] have me belie my
self." This questioned posed to Hathorne shows that Nurse suspected that
Hathorne desired her to confess even though she was innocent, and her
brave questioning of him ended the examination.</p>

<p>Hathorne's role in the trials leaves room for questioning his motives
for participating. Prior to Governor Phip's arrival in Massachusetts,
both Hathorne and Corwin had actively jailed many who were suspected of
witchcraft, thus setting the scene for each man to be biased toward the
guilt of those accused. Hathorne also appeared strangely calm while
questioning those accused of acting in the devil's name. Even Bridget
Bishop wondered why he did not fear that she would harm him if she was a
witch: Hathorne: How can you [Bridget Bishop] know, you are no Witch,
&amp; yet not know what a Witch is. Bridget Bishop: I am clear: if I
were any such person you should know it. (SWP I: 84, emphasis added)</p>

<p>If Hathorne believed that God protected him or if he knew that those
he questioned could be innocent cannot be proven either way. Bernard
Rosenthal suggests in Salem Story the possibility that Hathorne might
have also stood to have some financial gain from the trials from the
seizure of property that took place, and the same with the other judges.
Whatever his motives for such aggressive prosecution, however, Hathorne
put many innocent people to death and became the shame of his family
even down to his great-grandson, Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<p>Maintaining her innocence up until the moment of her execution,
Susannah North Martin was hanged with four other women on July 19, 1692
during the outbreak of witchcraft accusations in Salem. At the time of
her execution Martin was 67 and a widow. She arrived in Massachusetts in
1621 from Buckinghamshire, England, married the blacksmith George Martin
in Salisbury, in 1646 and had eight children. During the course of her
examination and trial 15 of Martin's neighbors accused her of afflicting
them through her specter, by pinching them or causing their farm animals
to die. The Reverend Cotton Mather believed her to be "one of the most
impudent, scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the World" Brave and
outspoken, Martin refused to allow her accusers to shake her
convictions. Standing in the courtroom, confronted by girls seemingly
writhing from "afflictions" they blamed on her, Martin maintained that
she only "desire[d] to lead my self according to the word of God." Asked
what she then made of the afflicted girls, she courageously suggested
that they might be the ones under the devil's influence, reminding the
judges that, "He [the devil] that appeared in the sam[e] shape a
glorifyed saint can appear in any ones shape." Her vehement denials made
no difference; the court only took her defiance as proof of her
reprobate character.</p>

<p>Martin was no stranger to witchcraft accusations, having been accused
two decades earlier. Her husband, deceased by the time of the Salem
outbreak, had countered the charges of witchcraft and infanticide with
slander suites. Although he did not win decisively, Susannah was
acquitted in the criminal courts. In public gossip, however, her
reputation as a witch appears to have continued irrespective of the
court's findings.</p>

<p>At the same time as the first accusations of witchcraft Susannah and
her husband were involved in a series of legal battles over her
inheritance. In 1688 her father, Richard North, died leaving two
daughters, a granddaughter and his second wife to share his sizable
estate. To the surprise of Susannah and her sister, they received only a
tiny portion while the bulk of the estate passed to his second wife, who
died soon after her husband. Susannah's stepmother left the majority of
North's estate to his granddaughter, continuing the exclusion of
Susannah and her sister. From 1671 to 1674 Susannah's husband and her
sister pursued a series of appeals, all of which were ultimately
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>These familial disputes over inheritance were incorporated by
historian Carol Karlsen in The Devil in the Shape of a Woman into her
interpretation of the Salem outbreak in socio-economic terms. Karlsen
postulated that accused witches were not only poor, disagreeable old
women, but also women of social and economic standing within their
community. Specifically, Karlsen believes there is a correlation between
witchcraft accusations and aberrations in the traditional line of
property transmission. She notes that property, particularly land,
typically went to the male relatives after the death of a parent. In the
cases of many of the accused women, however, Karlsen discovered a
pattern of women standing to inherit in the absence of male heirs. She
develops this theme, and Martin's place within her theory, in chapter
three of her book. Although Karlsen's book offers invaluable insights in
the role of gender in the Salem outbreak, in the case of Susannah Martin
her theory stretches a bit too thin. The inheritance debate, which
Karlsen cites as motivational for Martin's accusation, is separated from
the Salem outbreak by twenty years. Much fresher in the minds of her
accusers would be the outspokenness demonstrated by her comments during
her courtroom examination. In this case, the accused fits very well with
the stereotype of the accused witch as a disagreeable old woman.</p>

<p>Martin's descendant, John Greenleaf Whittier, immortalized her
innocence and bravery in his poem The Witches Daughter, published in
1857. Referring to Martin's refusal to lie to save her life, Whittier
wrote, "she whose speech was always truth's pure gold/Heard, not
unpleased, its simple legends told." Painting the scene of a pious
woman, ancient for her day at 67, passing the days in jail, Whittier
imagined Martin "who turned, in Salem's dreary jail/Her worn old Bible
o'er and o'er/When her dim eyes could read no more." This theme of
upright innocence also characterizes the multiple web sites dedicated to
the memory of Susannah Martin and maintained by her modern descendants
(see www.rootsweb.com/~nwa/sm.html and

<p>Sixteen year-old Margaret Jacobs was the daughter of George Jacobs,
Jr. After her father was accused of witchcraft and fled arrest from
Salem Village, Margaret Jacobs was left in the care of her mentally
unbalanced mother and had to fight Judge Hawthorne and his infamous
court alone. Abandoned both by her father and by uncle, Daniel Andrews,
who had also fled arrest, she confessed to having participated in
witchcraft in order to save herself from a trial. To strengthen her
confession, she named her own grandfather, George Jacobs, Sr. as a
witch, knowing that he had already been accused by others -- Marcy
Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Sarah Churchill. Later, stricken by her
conscience, she recanted her confession. According to Marion Starkey in
the Devil in Massachusetts , Margaret "confessed only under pressure of
fright when she had seen the accusing girls tumble down before her, and
out of terror of hanging." This statement emphasizes not only the guilt
of Margaret's conscience, but her knowledge and the knowledge of all
accusers, as to the nature of the trials at this stage. If you confessed
and named other people as witches, you would not be tried or executed.
Even at the price of her freedom, Jacobs could not lie. In Starkey's
words, she preferred a "death with a quiet conscience than to live in
such horror." The document in which she repudiated her confession and
accusations was produced in court but had no effect on the judges, who
wished to believe her confession. Margaret was, however, allowed to
visit her grandfather in jail the day before his death and seek his
forgiveness. George Jacobs, Sr. did hear of Margaret's courageous act
before he was put to death and added a special provision for her in his
will.</p>

<p>On August 20, the day after her grandfather was executed, Margaret
wrote a moving letter to her father. She stated, "The reason of my
Confinement [in jail] is this, I having, through the magistrates
Threatenings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed several
things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding of my
own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! The terrors of a wounded
Conscience who can bear and God knows how soon I shall be put to
death"(Salem Witchcraft Papers.</p>

<p>Bernard Rosenthal in Salem Story puts it best when he says, "One does
not often find people with the strength of Margaret Jacobs," especially
at such a young age. He is absolutely right. It is rare to find someone
willing to die for truth alone. Margaret was not the only woman accusing
her grandfather of witchcraft. He could have been executed on the
testimony of Sara Churchill and Mary Walcott alone. Margaret's
accusations did not lead directly to her grandfather's death. She could
have easily stuck to her story and avoided prison and the possibility of
death. Her retraction of her accusation could not save her grandfather's
life. The only thing that came out of her appeal to the magistrates was
her own imprisonment and death sentence, both of which she accepted in
order to live and die with the truth. Jacobs demonstrated at the age of
seventeen a virtue that many people never acquire, moral integrity. Her
story is a story of conscience and contrition which finds her alive in
the end.</p>

<p>She remained in prison after her grandfather's death, awaiting her
own fate. Her trial was temporarily postponed because of a boil on her
head, which proved fortunate for her, because the witchcraft court was
subsequently abolished, and she escaped the gallows. On January, 1693
she was brought before the newly established Superior Court of
Judicature and found innocent.</p>

 <p>"I veryly believe in my heart," began 19 -year-old Mercy Lewis on April 19,
1692, "that Giles Corey is a dreadful wizzard." Lewis's confidence in
herself was not unique to her accusation of Corey during the Salem
Witchcraft Trials. Throughout the months plagued by chaos and confusion
in Salem Village, Mercy Lewis acted as a member of the core group of
accusing young women in the Village, blatantly accusing several persons
of afflicting herself and her friends. Besides Giles Cory, Mercy Lewis
accused Bridget Bishop, Mary Lacey, Sr., Susannah Martin, John Willard,
Nehemiah Abbot, Jr., Sarah Wilds, and her former guardian, George
Burroughs. </p>

<p>Mercy Lewis was born in Falmouth, Maine in 1675. The Lewis
family lived in Maine until an Indian attack killed all of Mercy's
extended family. In the Devil's Snare  historian Mary Beth Norton
suspects that Mercy's parents were killed in a later attack witnessed by
Mercy herself. This tragic event cemented Mercy's connection between the
Wabanaki Indians and Satan. The settlers came to fear death, captivity,
and torture by the Indians. "In light of the perceived alliance between
Satan and the Wabanakis, such suffused dread could easily have been
vocalized in what became the commonplace description of the devil's
threats to 'tear [the afflicted] to pieces' if they did not comply with
his demands." Mercy testified to one of the witch conventions and
reported that they were singing biblical passages regarding God's
judgment of the heathen.</p>

<p>As a result of being orphaned, Mercy was sent
to live as a servant with Reverend George Burroughs in Maine and then
later to the household of Thomas Putnam in Salem Village. At the Putnam
household, Lewis befriended Ann Putnam and her cousin Mary Walcott who
were among the first to make claims of affliction by specters of
witches. From her previous experience, Mercy was chief source of
information about George Burroughs and the Hobbs family in Maine. To
support their accusations, Mercy Lewis and the other girls continued to
display spectral "evidence" of affliction. In one notable incident,
Lewis is reported by Edward Putnam to have been drawn helplessly by an
unseen force across a room directly towards a burning hearth while in
the presence of an accused Martha Corey. Norton notes that Mercy
displayed her leadership in the core group of accusers at least two
times. She dismissed Ann Jr.'s claim against Nehemiah Abbott Jr. by
saying that Ann was mistaken and "essentially single-handedly...
prevented [Mary] Easty from being freed" when all other accusations had
been withdrawn.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the girls, including Mercy Lewis,
actually were afflicted? The position taken by Bernard Rosenthal in
Salem Story considers two possible explanations. Either the girls were
experiencing psychological disorders or they were simply frauds, and
decides in favor of fraud. Nineteenth century historian Charles Upham,
author of Salem Witchcraft, suggests a mixture of explanations
"credulity, hallucination, and the delirium of excitement" to account
for the girls' behavior.</p>

<p> Regardless of what may have fueled the
incessant accusations, the fact remains that the girls accused innocent
persons of witchcraft, costing many of them their lives. Historian Carol
Karlsen in her book Devil in the Shape of a Woman attempts to explain
the girls' afflictions as a response to their personal insecurities --
both economic and social. Mercy Lewis's case illustrates Karlsen's point
well. Lewis experienced a traumatized childhood and lived in relatively
insecure social and economic circumstances. As an orphan, she had no
money or dowry to offer in marriage, so the chances of obtaining a
husband and thus escaping her social position of servitude must have
seemed bleak. Indeed, Rev. John Hale noted in his Modest Inquiry, two of
the "afflicted" Salem girls were anxious about their marriage prospects.
Norton draws attention to the Indian attacks in many of the girls' pasts
and comments that the status of the accusers shifted from lowest to
highest in the family and community. Daily life changed because the
girls stopped doing their chores and neighbors constantly visited to see
them perform. This was especially prominent at the Putnam household
where Mercy lived because so many of the women living there were
afflicted. Boyer and Nissenbaum, who cite primarily socio-economic
causes for the witchcraft trials, might agree that these girls -- who
possessed essentially no social standing before the trials -- were
greatly empowered by their accusations. Moreover, many of the accused
persons are examples of people who managed to climb the social ladder or
become assertive women -- both feats that Mercy Lewis was unable to
accomplish. Furthermore, because Mercy Lewis was not involved in the
initial accusations but rather joined Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, and
Elizabeth Hubbard later in the game, it seems that perhaps a desperate
need for social empowerment and belonging were strong underlying
motives.</p>

<p> Finally, it may be asked, "What did an accuser hope to achieve
by naming a person as a witch?" No one's socio-economic status improved
as a result of the trials, and most of the accused suffered financial
losses. Mercy Lewis herself did not marry until late in life and then
only after she had given birth to her first child. Perhaps Bernard
Rosenthal's response to the question is most appropriate. He replies
with a quotation from Herman Melville who simply asks, "How much money
did the devil make by gulling Eve?."</p>

<p>Although eighteen year-old Mary Walcott was not the most notorious of
the accusers, her role in the Salem witch trials was by no means
minimal. She was one of the original girls to be afflicted; and it was
her aunt, Mary Sibley, who decided to try some white magic to fend off
the evil powers in the village. It was Sibley's idea to persuade Tituba
and John Indian, slaves of the Rev. Samuel Parris, to make the "witch
cake" to discover witches that resulted in Betty Parris and Abigail
Williams making their first accusations.</p>

<p>Walcott's mother died when she was young and her father, Joseph
Walcott, Captain of the Salem Village militia, married Deliverance
Putnam thus making him the brother-in-law of Thomas Putnam, one of the
most powerful men in the village. The family alliance made Mary Walcott
the niece of Thomas Putnam and cousin of his twelve year-old daughter
Ann Putnam, Jr., a household that also included Mercy Lewis, an orphaned
servant girl, who, with Ann Putnam, Jr., became one of the most active
accusers.</p>

<p>Mary Walcott was not an aggressive accuser. In her book, The Devil in
Massachusetts, Marion Starkey describes Walcott as "a girl who could
take possession calmly. Mary Walcott was to sit placidly knitting
through a Dionysiac frenzy on the part of her companions." During the
examination of Sarah Cloyce, Mary Walcott was calm. "She had brought her
knitting with her, and became so intent on it that she clicked her
needles no matter what devils rioted about her. Every so often she
glanced up to confirm someone else's story" (Starkey 82). Walcott was
always a passive accuser but she was occasionally afflicted with the
more physical manifestations of witchcraft. When Mary Clarke, who had
been accused by Mary Post on August 4, was obstinate in giving her
confession, what Rosenthal describes as a "flurry of pins" ensued. Mary
Warren appeared in court with one stuck one in her throat, and Susannah
Sheldon had four in her hand and even the quiet Mary Walcott had one pin
in her arm. When former minister of Salem Village, Deodat Lawson,
returned to preach in Salem Village, he encountered Walcott at the
tavern of Nathaniel Ingersoll. "Lawson by candlelight examined a
mysterious set of teeth marks on the arm of one of the troubled girls,
seventeen-year-old Mary Walcott."</p>

<p>In Salem Story, Bernard Rosenthal refers to Walcott as "an old
standby" and one of the "regulars," a title he reserves for Ann Putnam,
Sr., Elizabeth Hubbard, Mercy Lewis, Abigail Williams, Betty Parris, and
Ann Putnam, Jr. Although she lacked the melodramatic behavior of her
fellow accusers, Walcott is an interesting example in support of Carol
Karlsen's theory. In her book The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, Karlsen
suggests that many of these girls, being either orphaned or partially
orphaned, feared for their social and economic security. Walcott allied
herself with the interests of the influential Putnam family in Salem
Village. An alliance with such a powerful dynasty ensured economic
viability for the uncertain future she faced. Mary Walcott is an example
of how teenage anxiety about the future could manifest itself in the
form of socially destructive behavior.</p>

<head><name>Sarah Osborne</name></head>

<p>Written By Meghan Carroll</p>

<p>Born in Watertown, Massachusetts in about 1643, Sarah Warren married
Robert Prince, a Salem Villager who purchased a 150-acre farm next to
Captain John Putnam's. Putnam was Prince's neighbor and also his
brother-in-law and the executor (along with Thomas Putnam) of his will.
When Prince died prematurely in 1674, he left his land entrusted to his
wife Sarah with the provision that upon their coming of age, it be given
to his and Sarah's two sons -- James, who was six-years-old at the time,
and Joseph, who was two. However, soon after her husband's death, Sarah
hired an indentured Irish immigrant by the name of Alexander Osborne as
a farm hand and paid off his indenture. Rumors spread about Sarah and
Alexander's living together and eventually the two were married. Sarah,
then attempted to overtake her children's inheritance and seize control
of the estate for herself and her new husband, thus breaking her
deceased husband's will. Legal battles ensued between Osborne and her
children, who were the rightful heirs of Prince's land and were defended
by the Putnams. Such conflict continued until February of 1692 when
Sarah Osborne became one of the first three persons accused of
witchcraft in Salem.</p>

<p>Sarah was accused by Thomas and Edward Putnam, Joseph Hutchinson, and
Thomas Preston for afflicting Ann Putnam, Jr., Betty Parris, Abigail
Williams, and Elizabeth Hubbard. Unlike the other two women accused with
her, Tituba and Sarah Good, Osborne never confessed to witchcraft nor
attempted to accuse anyone else. In her own defense, she was the first
defendant to assert in her defense the theological claim that the devil
could take the shape of another person without their compliance -- a
view that eventually prevailed and brought the Salem trials to a halt.
Nonetheless, Osborne never came to trial because she died, shackled in
prison on May 10, 1692 at the age of 49.</p>

<p>Why was Sarah Osborne accused of witchcraft? To answer this question,
we must look closely at the society in which she lived and at her
reputation in it. Historians Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum argue
that many of the accused witches were perceived as upsetting established
"patterns of land tenure and inheritance." Sarah Osborne fits this
profile. Not only was Salem Village aware of her fornication with
Alexander (an obvious Puritan sin), but by endeavoring to gain full
ownership of her late husband's estate, she disregarded her society's
set practices of inheritance and land tenure, and challenged the
tradition of strong, extended family alliances. By aspiring to deny her
two sons of their wealth and social position, she threatened the growth
and stability of Putnam family alliances in Salem Village.</p>

<p>Is a woman who betrays her society's social and family conventions
worthy of an accusation of witchcraft? Not in today's society, but in
seventeenth century New England these offenses were socially and
economically serious, and a threat to the divinely sanctioned social
order. Specifically, the Putnam family's economic interests and
inheritance grew less secure by Sarah's attempt at social and economic
independence. Consequently, but not surprisingly, it was members of the
Putnam family who accused Osborne.</p>

<p>While such theories may offer explanations as to why Sarah Osborne,
as opposed to her husband Alexander, was accused of witchcraft, we might
also ask why she was actually convicted. If only 19 of the approximately
160 people accused were actually executed, what prevented Sarah Osborne
from surviving? Unlike Tituba and Sarah Good who both confessed to
witchcraft and falsely accused Osborne, Osborne did not confess nor did
she accuse anyone else, and hence unknowingly at this stage, she closed
an opportunity that might have saved her. Even though it later became
apparent that the way to survive an accusation was to confess and to
point fingers at others, Sarah Osborne repeatedly affirmed her
innocence. When asked by local officials why she practiced with the
devil, Osborne responded with bewilderment that she "was more like to be
bewitched than that she was a witch." Ultimately, it was her refusal to
compromise her integrity that cost Sarah Osborne her life.</p>

<head><name>Governor, Sir William Phips</name></head>

<p>William Phips was born in a small English community in coastal Maine,
now called Woolwich, on February 2, 1651. His father, James Phips,
operated a trading post, engaging in the fur trade and repair of
firearms with the Wabanaki Indians and local settlers. William spent
most of his childhood carrying out chores on his family's farm, leaving
little time for formal education. In fact, he did not learn to read or
write until later in life, and never with great ease. </p>

<p>At 18, Phips took
a four-year apprenticeship with a shipbuilder. In 1673, at the
culmination of the four years, Phips moved to Boston to work as a
shipwright. Shortly after, he married Mary Spencer Hull, the widow of
merchant John Hull of Boston. Boston afforded Phips greater social
status and he became a ship's captain. At this time, Phips was what
Daniel Defoe defined in Essay upon Projects (1697) as projector--an
"individual who sought wealth and advancement through money-making
schemes financed by others." In the summer of 1683, Phips traveled to
London to seek patronage for treasure hunting expeditions in the
Caribbean, which he received from several high-ranking naval officers
and the royal crown. In 1687, Phips discovered substantial treasure
aboard the sunken Spanish ship, Concepci&#243;n. Phips' crew recovered
between 205,000 and 210,000 English pounds of treasure. Phips' share
amounted to 11,000 pounds after the crews were paid and one tenth was
given to the king. </p>

<p>Phips' great discovery made him a celebrity in
England. In late June of 1687, Phips was knighted by King James II 'in
consideration of his Loyalty, and good services in a late Expedition.'
He returned to Boston as New England's provost marshal general, a legal
position for which he had no experience. He did not remain in Boston
long, and returned to England to give up his post. </p>

<p>While in Boston,
Phips had befriended the president of Harvard College, Rev. Increase
Mather and his son, the Rev. Cotton Mather. In 1689, Phips made a
profession of faith at North Church, the church of Rev. Cotton Mather,
and was baptized. It is unclear whether Phips really did discover a new
sense of spirituality, or whether he desired to initiate a relationship
with Mather and his father. Whatever his reason, Phips' relationship
with the Mathers proved politically successful, as they ensured that he
was chosen to command military expeditions against the French colonies
of Acadia and Canada. These expeditions proved disastrous, and Phips
spent the next two years in London with Increase Mather, petitioning for
the Massachusetts Charter. When the charter was granted in 1691, Mather
used his influence to nominate Phips as the first Royal Governor of the
colony. </p>

<p> Phips returned to Massachusetts on May 14, over two months after
the witchcraft accusations began in Salem Village. Phips established the
Court of Oyer and Terminer, to "hear and determine" the large backlog of
cases. Until recently, historians have failed to recognize the extent of
Governor William Phips' involvement in the Salem witch trials, probably
because Phips made a determined effort to distance himself from the
ordeal. Phips wrote letters to England in which he acknowledged the
existence of the trials but claimed to be fighting Indians during
"almost the whole time of the proceeding." Mary Beth Norton proves that
such claims were false and that Phips "had in fact been in Boston during
most of the court sessions." </p>

<p>According to Norton, Phips was well
informed about the trials and supported them while they lasted. Using
surviving council minutes as her basis, Norton asserts: "Phips met
regularly throughout June and July with the judges of the Court of Oyer
and Terminer." Therefore, he "must have been well informed about the
progress of the witchcraft trials." According to Norton, it is highly
unlikely, "if not wholly impossible" that they did not discuss the
trials during these meetings, since the subject was of such "pressing
importance to everyone." Both the governor and his wife met many of the
criteria that identified witches--i.e. engaging in treasure hunting,
consulting a fortune teller, employing a servant of Indian origins,
having extensive links to Maine--and Phips probably supported the trials
to protect himself and his wife from possible accusations.</p>

<p> In October,
Governor Phips permanently shut down the Court of Oyer and Terminer due
to both political and personal reasons. Much debate had been "roiling
the colony's political and religious elite" since Phips had partially
halted the proceedings on October 12 to wait for orders from England. A
"political and theological firestorm" erupted between supporters and
opponents of the trials. Supporters wanted the proceedings to continue
without delay. Opponents were upset that arrests and prosecutions would
continue during the many months it would take to receive word from the
monarch. Phips realized that the best way to quiet the discontent was to
dissolve the court entirely. On a personal level, Norton points out that
"in his letters to England, Phips stressed his growing realization that
apparitions could appear in the form of innocents." Such a realization
must have weighed heavily on Phips when he thought about the enormous
importance given to spectral evidence in the trials. Shortly after the
trials, in mid-November 1694, complaints by William's political
opponents caused the king to recall him to England. He died of fever in
London in February 1695.</p>

<p>When Ann was arrested on May 12th 1692, she was a twice-widowed woman
of property in Salem Town. Although her testimony is well-documented in
the transcripts of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, details of her
origins before the trials of 1692 are largely unknown. Ann is thought to
have been born in England sometime between 1622 and 1627. She married
her first husband, Thomas Greenslit (also spelled Greenslade) and had
five children with him sometime before 1677. Her name appears for the
first time in the public record of Salem Town on the certificate of
inventory for the his estate following his death in 1674.</p>

<p>The family had likely lived in Falmouth, Maine during the birth of
Ann's children, Thomas, Ruth, John, James, and Samuel, between 1650
&amp; 1660. Although the eventual whereabouts of each of her children
remains almost as unknown as Ann's own activities, her eldest son Thomas
Pudeator went on to play a central role in the trial of the Reverend
George Burroughs. He testified to the man's extraordinary feat of
strength in lifting a gun at arm's length with just one finger in the
barrel. In Salem Story, historian Bernard Rosenthal suggests that this
may have been a last-ditch effort by Thomas to save his own mother from
execution by appearing to join sides with the witch-hunters.</p>

<p>Ann was left destitute after her first husband died in 1674, probably
working in the paid profession of a midwife and nurse. Her name does not
appear again until March of 1678, when she is recorded as the wife of
her neighbor Jacob Pudeator, a man about 20 years her junior. This
unusual circumstance was calls attention to the fact that Ann had served
as nurse to Jacob's first wife Isabel during her illness, and married
Jacob less than a year after Isabel's unexplained death between
1675-1676. Jacob, too, passed away in 1682, leaving monetary bequests to
each of Ann's five children, as well as the remainder of his property to
Ann herself. Afterwards, Ann occupied the rather precarious position of
being a professional woman of property in a male-dominated society.</p>

<p>Historian Carol F. Karlsen suggests that Ann became a prime target
for allegations of witchcraft after she scolded John Best, Jr. for
returning her lost cow from his fold. Best claimed that "he did conclude
said Pudeator was a witch" because she "would chide me when I came home
from turning the cow back." In her book, The Devil in the Shape of a
Woman, Karlsen argues that women such as Ann who dared to defy the
Puritan gender standard of the unassertive and docile female put
themselves at great risk to be singled out for punishment through
witchcraft accusations. She also implies that Ann's occupation of
midwife, regardless of whether she earned money (for this is not
confirmed), may have threatened other male medical professionals in
Salem Town, leading to accusations. Birth was a risky act and filled
with apprehension in that time period, loss of life during the process
was often blamed on the malignant forces of the devil at work through
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Whatever the motivations for her accusers, a warrant for Ann Pudeator
and another woman, Alice Parker, was written on May 12th 1692. Pudeator
was brought to trial on July 2nd, 1692. Sarah Churchill was the first to
accuse Ann of having tormented her, by appearing with the book of the
devil and asking her to sign it. She also accused Ann of having
presented her with several images of accusing girls that she proceeded
to torture like voodoo dolls with thorns. Five more of the circle of
accusing girls confirmed these accusations - both Mary Warren and Ann
Putnam falling into fits during Pudeator's examination and then being
cured by a touch of Ann's hand. In addition to these displays, Elizabeth
Hubbard, Mary Walcott, and Sarah Bibber also presented testimony that
Pudeator had afflicted them through pinching, pressing and choking. The
constable Joseph Neal described his discovery of "curious containers of
various ointments" suspected to have been associated with Ann's alleged
witchcraft at her house upon her arrest, and asserted that she was an
"ill-carriaged woman" whom he was convinced had adversely affected his
wife in her service as midwife. During her examination Ann insisted that
these jars were simply filled with Neat's Foot Oil. Incriminating
evidence of Ann's relation to animal familiars was given by Samuel
Pickworth, who related seeing a bird fly by one night as he walked upon
Salem Street, and soon after noticing a woman coming out of Ann's home,
presumably the same entity as the bird. Going even farther, Mary Warren
said that Pudeator had caused John Turner to fall from a tree, and
accused Ann of killing her husband Jacob, Jacob's first wife Isabel, as
well as the wives of John Best and Joseph Neal.</p>

<p>Throughout the trials, Ann remained consistent but relatively
unassertive in her declrations of innocence. She insisted that she did
not know her accusers, nor anything of the art of witchcraft. In
response to curiosity about the ointments, she simply explained they
were containers of grease to make her soap. Although her testimony in
itself was not particularly noteworthy, her petition to the court,
written before her death, merits acknowledgement for its simple
denunciation of her accusers. Bernard Rosenthal brings this to light in
his book, Salem Story,, pointing out that Ann accused Mary Warren, Sarah
Churchill, John Best, Sr. and Jr., and Samuel Pickworth of bearing false
witness against her. Particularly of note was her scathing addition that
John Best Jr. was a known liar: "the abovesaid Jno Best hath been
formerly whipt and likewise is [recorded] for a Lyar". In retrospect,
this charge cast considerable doubt upon the validity of John's
accusations, as well as the credibility of any court that would admit
the testimony of a publicly acknowledged liar.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, not one of Ann's children came to her defense
during the trials. Widowed and abandoned by her remaining kinfolk, Ann
Pudeator, at that time somewhere between 70 and 75 years old, was hanged
upon Gallows Hill on Sept. 22nd 1692, in what would be the final set of
executions resulting from the Salem Witch trials.</p>

<p>Although described as a &quot;generous, compassionate. . . man of
conscience,&quot; the late-seventeenth-century New England Puritan
Samuel Sewall sat on the court of judges who condemned nineteen innocent
men and women to be hanged as witches during the Salem witchcraft trials
of 1692. Both Sewall's private diary and the books he published during
his lifetime depict his agony over the decisions and his lingering
personal distress. Fearful of God's judgment upon himself and his
family, he eventually proclaimed his humiliation to God and the Colony
in a confession of guilt read before the congregation of South Church in
Boston.</p>

<p>Born in England in 1652, Sewall immigrated to Newberry, Massachusetts
in 1667. At the age of fifteen, he began theological studies at Harvard
to obtain a Bachelors degree and he then continued to achieve a Masters
degree. The pursuit of a Masters degree for most people meant a calling
to the ministry. However, instead of preaching, in 1675 Sewall married
Hannah Hull, the daughter of John Hull, a wealthy mint master in Boston,
Massachusetts. With this marriage, Sewall inherited business
responsibilities, and thus he began the life, which he would continue
until his death, as a merchant in Boston. The choice of ministry or
merchandise troubled Sewall, but in reality, his decision to become an
active apprentice with Hull was inevitable. During this time period,
gradually power was moving away from the pulpit and into the hands of
the wealthy: the merchants.</p>

<p>With wealth and power came the opportunity, or rather commitment, to
public service. Sewall did not shy away from these duties, but rather
embraced them. In 1677 he became of member of the South Church in Boston
which enabled him to become a freeman of the colony in 1678. In 1684,
Sewall was elected to the Court of Assistants (the legislative body of
the Massachusetts Bay Colony), and in May of 1692, Governor Sir William
Phips appointed Sewall as a commissioner (judge) in the Oyer and
Terminer Court, a court established to bring to trial those accused of
witchcraft. Eventually Sewall would culminate his public life with a
seat on the governor's council and an appointment as a justice for the
Superior Court of Massachusetts in 1698.</p>

<p>During this era, the colony relied mostly on Biblical authority; thus
a judge needed to be instructed in the word of God over that of common
law. Hence when Governor Phips appointed he judges for the Court of Oyer
and Terminer, Sewall was an ideal choice. He had a strong theological
background and the contemporary belief in the devil and witches. As the
trials progressed during 1692, Sewall joined with the other judges
(Richards, Gedney, Winthrop, Sargent, Corwin, Stoughton) and condemned
nineteen people to death. Yet, an unanswered question remains. Did
Sewall feel remorse at the time for these decisions, or did he truly
believe that he was acting correctly and in line with Puritan and
biblical values? The answer remains unknown since Sewall's diary entries
during the trials primarily tell the facts, if even any of those, rather
than his thoughts and opinions.</p>

<p>Yet, Sewall's thoughts after the trials are known because of both his
diary and public voice. During the five years following the trials, two
daughters, Jane and Sarah, died, as did his beloved mother-in-law. In
combination with a stillborn child and the public humiliation he
sustained from the trials, Sewall experienced constant distress. He
truly believed that the witchcraft accusations and trials &quot;the
wrath of God visited upon him&quot; as he was a sinner and had not
repented (Lovejoy, 358). At this same time, New Englanders recognized
the need for reckoning with God. Thus, on January 14, 1697, all parties,
including ministers and government officials, agreed to a colony-wide
&quot;Day of Prayer and Fasting.&quot; On this famous day, the Reverend
Willard read to his Boston congregation a confession of guilt written by
Sewall himself:</p>

<p>&quot;...as to the Guilt contracted, upon the opening of the late
Commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order for this
Day relates) he is, upon many accounts, more concerned that any that he
knows of, Desires to take the Blame and Shame of it, Asking pardon of
Men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who has an Unlimited
Authority, would pardon that Sin and all other his Sins; personal and
Relative: And according to his infinite Benignity, and Sovereignty, Not
Visit the Sin of him, or of any other, upon himself or any of his, nor
upon the Land. . . &quot;</p>

<p>In his own words, Sewall begged God for forgiveness and asked that
that God &quot;cease visiting his sins upon him, his family, and upon
the land&quot; (Lovejoy, 360).</p>

<p>Sewall confessed because he believed he had made a &quot;grave error
in condemning those tried in the Salem proceedings&quot; and that his
belief in the covenant with God would save him (Graham, 45). In the
covenant, one enters into a bond with God, he sins, is afflicted,
repents, is forgiven, and enters back into the covenant (Miller, 197).
Sewall recognized his sins in condemning innocent people to the gallows.
Part of the community's hope with the &quot;Day of Pray and
Fasting&quot; was that others, too, would recognize their sins
throughout the trials and then repent for their actions. If the whole
community asked for forgiveness, perhaps God would shed peace on the
fragmented community that had faced crop failure, losses at sea,
epidemics, Indian raids, and the threat of the French. In the end, no
other judge offered a confession, but the Salem jurors and several
ministers did so throughout the year.</p>

<p>Although Samuel Sewall's name rarely appears in the actual court
documents, he was a prominent figure in the Salem witchcraft trials. Not
only do Sewall's diary entries recount the events and provide vital
information for scholars studying the trials, but his confession plays a
significant role since it is one few. He alone stood before society and
proclaimed that society had done wrong. He took responsibility for his
actions and thus his outstanding moral character does not diminish
because of his mistakes during 1692.</p>

<p>Samuel Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643 to Thomas Wardwell and
Elizabeth Hooper in Boston, Massachusetts. Samuel was the youngest of
three boys. Martha, the only girl, died in 1337 during childbirth.
Though little is known of the Wardwell family, they seem to have come
from a modest Quaker background, and each boy was not afforded a great
inheritance. Young Samuel took an interest in carpentry and was
finishing a apprenticeship in Boston in 1664, at the age of twenty-one,
when his life would take a different course toward the town of
Salem.</p>

<p>In 1664, Samuel's eldest brother, Eliakim, had moved to New Jersey
and became a leader among the large numbers of Quakers who had recently
moved there. At the same time, Samuel's other brother, Benjamin, moved
to Salem in search of a seaman's job in the town's thriving commercial
shipping business (Robinson 57). Young Samuel decided to follow his
brother to Salem in order to practice carpentry. At this time, Salem was
rapidly growing, as old houses were being enlarged, and many new ones
were being built .</p>

<p>Upon moving to Salem, Samuel met an unidentified woman whom he
married and they had a son named Thomas. Unfortunately, his wife died in
1671 and Samuel moved to nearby Andover with his young son in search of
a new life. There were several prominent men living in Andover at the
time. One of these was Simon Bradstreet, a magistrate, who had gotten
into a conflict with Eliakim Wardwell. Eliakim had called the
magistrate's daughter, a "dishonest woman." There is a good chance that
the bad blood between these two families would be a cause for Samuel's
indictment for witchcraft twenty years later. Another established
resident of Andover was Richard Barker. Barker's twenty-five year-old
daughter, Sarah, fell in love with Samuel Wardwell, and the couple
planned to marry. However, because Samuel was not a member of Andover's
leading families, the couple's plans were quickly halted.</p>

<p>Since moving to Andover, Samuel often amused his neighbors by telling
fortunes, a practice forbidden by the Puritan religion, because it was
regarded as a magical activity. It is likely that Samuel was simply
immature and practiced magic for sport. However, several members of
Andover knew of his pastime, and remembered them years later in 1692.
"He was fabled, for example to have the strange power of getting into
people's dreams, and regulating matters there to his own fancy (Robinson
62)." In addition, he prophesized in 1677 that a young couple in Andover
would have five daughters before they had a son. Amazingly, this turned
out to be true. Unfortunately for Wardwell, the boy was born just a few
years before the witch scare, furthering his link to the supernatural
and placing him as a suspect for witchcraft.</p>

<p>In the years prior to the witch trials, anyone dabbling in magic or
fortune telling was thought to be linked to the devil. Though the
practice of fortune telling was not uncommon among New Englanders in the
seventeenth century, Wardwell's well-known practice of magic, albeit for
sport, made him a prime target for witchcraft accusation in 1692.</p>

<p>The final reason for Wardwell's accusation of witchcraft, was due to
his neighbors' jealousy of his sudden wealth. As can be seen in cases of
other accused persons in Salem and Andover, those who gained or lost
wealth were more prone to be accused than others. To everyone surprise,
Sarah Hawkes, a young, beautiful, twenty-two year-old widow, with a
sizable inheritance, decided to marry Samuel Wardwell on January 9,
1673. Samuel was not a member of the gentry and had no dowry to offer
Sarah. Nevertheless, they married and preceded to have seven children.
Their three boys were Samuel, Jr., Eliakim, and William. Samuel and
Sarah's four girls were Mercy, Elizabeth (who died in three days),
another Elizabeth, and Rebecca. Due to Sarah's sizable inheritance and
Samuel's hard work as a carpenter, the couple lived a prosperous life
with a large farm in the south of Andover, and land in Lynn. (Robinson
62-63).</p>

<p>As the witchcraft scare rose in 1692, the Wardwells were living
comfortably on their farm. At the age of 49, Samuel was arrested on
August 15, 1692 and imprisoned in Salem Town. With him, wife Sarah and
daughters Sarah and Mercy were also accused of witchcraft. Though Samuel
was one of the last in the Salem area to be arrested, it was not
surprising that the witchcraft court tracked him down. Not only had
Wardwell dabbled in magic, but he had gained sizable wealth for a common
citizen. In addition, his brother's affront to Andover's leading
citizen, Simon Bradstreet, sealed his fate, as most of his accusers came
from Andover.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1692, Samuel confessed before magistrate John
Higginson, saying that he had indeed dabbled in the supernatural by
"telling of fortunes, which sometimes came to pass." Not only did he
confess this indiscretion, he also reported making a pact with the
devil. Wardwell confessed that the devil promised to make him "live
comfortably and be a sea captain." In return, Wardwell promised to
"honor" him, signing the devil's "book by making a mark like a square
with a black pen." Samuel Wardwell's claim seems absurd, yet he was
probably trying his best to save his life. He knew that many people
learned of his suspicious behavior as a young man, telling fortunes.
Like several others who had saved their lives by confessing, he made up
a grand tale, which included much more demonic activity than anyone else
had attributed to him.</p>

<p>Soon, however, Wardwell's conscience made him recant his confession.
Now, not only was he in a dangerous position pleading innocent before
the Court of Oyer and Terminer, but there was a written confession, and
two complaints against him. One simply stated his use of witchcraft,
another mentioned his compact with the devil. There were also seven
formal accusations which said that Wardwell afflicted people and other
statements which corroborated his use of witchcraft and fortune telling.
Not surprisingly, the court found Wardwell guilty on September 17th. He
was hanged on September 22, 1692, along with seven women.</p>

<head><name>Samuel Willard</name></head>

<p>Written By Dave Hendrick</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>In evaluating those Puritan ministers involved in the Salem witch
trials, we would certainly have to regard the Rev. Samuel Willard of
Boston as one of the virtuous clergymen, as he was opposed to the trials
and tried to influence public opinion against them in 1692. Undoubtedly,
great things had long been expected of Willard, as his family lineage
bespeaks that of a man destined to make an impact upon the
community.</p>

<p>Willard was born in the town Concord, Massachusetts Bay in 1640. His
place among the town's leaders was virtually assured from birth, as his
father, Simon Willard, was the founder of Concord. Willard soon set out
on the familiar course for young aspiring ministers, enrolling at
Harvard where he would study long enough to receive his Master's Degree
in 1659. Indeed, Samuel Willard could very well be remembered solely for
his fiery devotion to the Puritan church, as he was well known for his
vicious denunciations of any attempts to water down the Puritan tenets
of predestination, irresistible grace, total depravity, and perseverance
of the saints. Willard was also known for his staunch support for the
continued marriage between church and state, and held strong opposition
to the creeping Quaker and Baptist influences in the community. In these
ways, Willard's sermons were heavily influential to men who would take
up the Puritan cause after his death, Jonathan Edwards in particular.
Nevertheless, it is Willard's role in the witch trials that concerns us
here.</p>

<p>Willard's past experience seems to make him a fine candidate to speak
out about the trials of the 1690s, as he played a crucial role in
heading off a potential outbreak of hysteria some twenty years prior to
the Salem episode. In 1671, while ministering in the frontier town of
Groton, Massachusetts Bay, Willard was witness to a number of strange
acts that befell one of his servants, a young girl of sixteen by the
name of Elizabeth Knapp. Knapp seems to have exhibited a number of the
symptoms that would be made famous by the "afflicted" girls of Salem
village twenty years later. Indeed, Knapp was observed to act in a
"strange and unwonten" manner, and often fell into violent fits and
complained of being attacked. When Knapp eventually accused the specter
of a neighbor of attacking her, Willard insisted she put an end to such
accusations at once, for the neighbor was a person of "sincere
uprightness before God." Also, Willard seems to have exercised good
judgment in being hesitant to believe that the devil afflicted the girl,
writing that "Whither shee has covenanted with the Devill or noe, I
think this is a case unanswerable, her declarations have been soe
contradictorye. . . . ". Although Willard was yet to denounce the idea
of Satan using a person's image or specter to attack another person,
here he seems to have used impeccable judgment in not rushing to
conclusions about why his young woman appeared afflicted.</p>

<p>Willard's role in Salem also presents a man concerned that innocent
people must be protected from the misinformed and vicious elements in
the Puritan society. When Governor William Phips sought guidance from
some of the learned clergy in the area, Willard was one of the several
who signed "The Return of Several Ministers." This document acknowledged
that while the devil might be responsible for the afflictions found in
Salem, it urged the court to exercise great caution to prevent the
innocent from being convicted. The ministers further discounted the
reliability of spectral evidence by asserting that the devil could
impersonate the likeness of any person, even an "innocent" without that
person's permission. Although the court in Salem ignored this caution,
spectral evidence was eventually called into question the trials lost
their theological foundation. The work of Willard and his like minded
colleagues also shows that to whatever extent clergymen in Salem may
have contributed to the witchcraft outbreak, Willard and other Boston
ministers tried to quell its spread.</p>

<p>A level-headed moderate concerning witchcraft, Willard is thought to
have written a sixteen page fictional dialogue between two ministers who
hold opposed points of view on the Salem trials. One minister
represented the views of the Salem clergy, the other represented the
Boston ministers. The dialogue, entitled "Some Miscellany Observations
on our present debates respecting Witchcrafts: A Dialogue between 'S'
and 'B'" is clearly the work of one who saw great injustice in the
theological and legal aspects of the trials. Among Willard's chief
complaints is the fact that so often a confession coupled with further
accusations resulted in an acquittal, while a denial of guilt virtually
guaranteed one's conviction. Among the Boston minister's key arguments
in the dialogue is that "witches" who ultimately confess and accuse
other witches are not to be trusted, because, after all, they're
witches! When the Salem clergyman decries using too much caution,
allowing many witches to go free, Boston replies that "the more horrid
the crime is, the more cautious we ought to be in making any guilty of
it." Boston's point being that relying on the suspect spectral evidence
was no basis from which to ruin men and women's lives and cast a
permanent stigma upon their family name.</p>

<p>Samuel Willard continued to be a tireless anti-trial activist well
after the trials had passed. In 1694, he pushed for a reconciliation
between the pro and anti-Samuel Parris factions within Salem village.
Willard was also known to ask, in public ceremony and sermon, for God to
forgive the atrocities that had taken place in Salem at the hands of
overzealous townsfolk.</p>

<p>Born in 1653 as the younger son of a London cloth merchant, Samuel
Parris began his life in the shadow of others.  By his father's death in
1673 when Samuel was twenty years old, it was clear that he would need
to leave England for any chance at financial independence and success. 
Failing at business in a Caribbean sugar plantation and later in
business activities in Boston, Parris eventually decided to join the
ministry and look for an appropriate parish in New England.  His search
culminated at the little village of Salem where the local elders offered
the ministry church. </p>

<p>The position was ideally what Parris needed, but he
was aware  the past conflicts over the village minister and took nearly
a year to make his decision.  As he knew, the village had gone through
three other ministers in relatively quick succession, and no one before
Parris had been deemed worthy to be ordained.  During this year of
negotiations Parris wrangled for his salary and benefits, in the process
creating an exceptional amount of animosity towards him within certain
village factions.  By demanding more pay and benefits such as ownership
of the village minister's house, free firewood, and bonuses for any
outsiders preached to on Sundays, Parris indicated an important trait in
his personality.  He saw his position as something demanding and
deserving respect above all else.  In Parris' mind, by not deferring to
his needs and desires those who opposed him marked themselves as people
against traditional reverent attitudes towards the church.  This may
have contributed to his support and to the torrent of witchcraft
accusations throughout 1692.  He did not trust those who did not follow
the world order as he saw it, and was fearful of the influence of
outsiders on the village itself. </p>

<p>Parris' preaching had a major hand in
creating the divisions within the village that contributed to the
accusations of 1692.  During the crisis, he declared the church under
siege by the Devil, who was assisted by "Wicked &amp; Reprobate men." This
was during the last sermon his daughter Betty and niece Abigail heard
before they became "afflicted."  As Mary Beth Norton puts it in In the
Devil's Snare, almost undoubtedly those "wicked" men were among Parris'
detractors and opposition within the community. Parris believed in his
moral superiority and was determined to draw battle lines. Even as early
as November of 1691, the minister called on churchgoers to "Sit thou at
my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool." He intended to
have his supporters and the church unified against anyone that would
dare speak against him.</p>

<p> As some historians believe, Parris and other
adults around him may have had a major hand in "picking" some of the
accused. Through either direct order or indirect insinuation, Parris
may have chosen not only those who represented an unusual or disliked
position in the village, but also those who had supported his enemies
and critics. </p>

<p>Parris himself had a major part in the actual trials,
serving as a witness who submitted legal complaints about the girls'
sufferings.  Along with other prominent men, Parris testified about the
attacks of Rebecca Nurse against Ann Putnam Sr., Jr., Mary Walcot and
Abigail Williams.  He declared that at the trial when Nurse's hands were
freed, "some of the afflicted were pinched and upon the motion of
[Nurse's] head and fingers some of [the girls] were tortured and farther
that some of the afflicted then and there affirmed that they saw a black
man whispering into [Nurse's] ear."  As questionable as the girls claims
may have been to any observer, the support and testimony of such an
influential and educated man could not have done anything but strengthen
their claims.  Unlike the ministers in nearby Ipswich, Rowley, and
Beverly, who stepped forward to defend some of the accused, Parris was
clearly filled with "credulity and pitiless zeal," as Marion Starkey
aptly puts it. </p>

<p>While Parris' actions, or lack thereof, certainly
demonstrate a rather reprehensible character, it would be a mistake to
assume that contemporaries believed the same.  Indeed, in 1695, two
years after the end of the trials, Parris still garnered a majority of
town support. This demonstrates not only the ambiguity of the trials in
late 17th century imaginations, but also the influence that Parris held
within the community.  While much of the village did support him to a
certain degree, it should also be noted that Rebecca Nurse's family and
others directly accused the minister of providing names to the court,
and many people had strong misgivings about his place in the trials.  By
1696 village sentiment and growing irritation finally forced Parris out
of town in favor of Reverend Green, a man who genuinely wanted to heal
Salem and started the village on the long and uncertain road to
recovery. </p>

<p>While the trials eventually extended well outside Parris'
control and ability to predict, he undoubtedly holds a position of
importance regarding their genesis.  Historians Boyer and Nissenbaum in
their well-known history, Salem Possessed, define Parris as a "reference
point" from which to view the trials and their beginning. He was seen in
the village as a dividing line between two groups, in his mind the
believers and true Christians of his small congregation versus the
suspicious and dangerous people who would not join it.  He represented
the hatred in the village that enabled people to attack each other so
horribly.  By naming specific individuals and pushing certain
accusations, Parris earns responsibility as one of the most tarnished
characters in the history of Salem's story.  As Miller represented him
in The Crucible, the Rev. Samuel Parris was the embodiment of
self-serving and small-minded reactionary behavior.  If we are not
careful to guard against those like him, our freedom and the sanity of
society are in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Written By Alyssa Barillari</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>In late February of 1692, Reverend Samuel Parris called in a doctor
to examine his nine-year-old daughter, Betty, and eleven-year-old niece,
Abigail Williams-both of whom were suffering from spontaneous fits. The
children were soon diagnosed as victims of witchcraft, setting off an
outbreak of panic and hysteria, which would sweep throughout Salem
Village and its neighboring towns that year. Historians have long
pointed the collective finger of blame at the Parris's slave, Tituba,
one of the three women first accused of witchcraft, and the only member
of this unfortunate trio to survive the year.</p>

<p>Many interpretations of the Salem Trials acknowledge the pivotal role
Tituba's confession played in legitimizing the early suspicions and
subsequent investigations of witchcraft, seizing on the vivid
descriptions of the devil and his minions that she provided to the
examining justices. A number of sources also assert that Tituba also
introduced supernatural ideas to the "afflicted girls." These scholars
claim Reverend Parris had purchased her in Barbados, unaware of the
voodoo and witchcraft practices she would eventually undertake under the
roof of the Salem parsonage.</p>

<p>However, the mantle of guilt so eagerly thrust upon Tituba may not be
rightfully hers (and at the very least, not hers alone). Later
investigations have only raised more questions about the very little
verifiable information available on her. Most of the perceptions and
understandings of Tituba, today commonly accepted as fact, are actually
based on local tradition and fictional literature rather than actual
court documents or eye-witness accounts. Admittedly, the legend of
Tituba as the "Black Witch of Salem" (a posthumous appellation which
immediately suggests interesting racial and class connotations) may be
more mysterious and entertaining than the accurate historical extent of
her influence on the Salem trials; nevertheless, the ways in which this
myth has been constructed are fascinating as well.</p>

<p>In all of the court documents relating to the Witchcraft Trials,
Tituba's identity is listed as that of an "Indian Woman, servant" (for
example, Warrant vs. Tituba and Sarah Osborne -SWP 745). But as scholars
have recently pointed out, somewhere in the development of the Salem
lore, Tituba's racial heritage has been transformed and confused-thus
she appears in texts variously as "Negro," "half-breed," "colored," or
"half-Indian, half-Negro." Assumptions about her origins range from the
island of Barbados to Africa to Native American. This confusion
necessarily complicates any understanding of the consequential and
critical part traditionally assigned to Tituba; we must consider how
racial stereotypes and presumptions have contributed to the varying
amounts of blame she is forced to bear.</p>

<p>Truthfully, Tituba's story may never be clearly sorted out. Her
status as a slave constrains any attempts to uncover official records
and papers relating to her. The little glimpse of her life that is
available is provided only by the court transcripts themselves. Though
Tituba's words may resonate to us through the court records, she cannot
tell her version of the events leading up to the Trials, she cannot
share her own history and memory of Salem and life before it. In
addition to Tituba's own recorded words, we can obtain some information
based on what her contemporaries said of her. Beyond these strict
limitations however, we can realistically draw no further conclusions as
to her racial identity, affinity for witchcraft and stories of the
occult, nor motivations for confessing to the accusations.</p>

<p>What we do know is from the historical documents is that Tituba was
in fact a slave in the Parris home at the time of Betty and Abigail's
initial sufferings. Tradition holds that she was married to another
slave, John Indian, and the couple was purchased by Reverend Parris
during time he spent in Barbados. Tradition, however, does not a history
make. Tituba and John Indian did reside with the Parrises; Samuel Parris
had a plantation in Barbados, and he owned two slaves after he returned
to Boston, and she could have come from Barbados. However, the story
that Tituba struck the "fatal spark" and ignited simmering tensions in
Salem Village by enthralling the local teenage girls with her stories of
African or Caribbean voodoo and magic spells must be recognized for what
it is --a story. It was not her "voodoo spells and stories" which, in
fact, caused the girls' initial hysterics but their practice of
forbidden fortune telling.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the court records or contemporary accounts is Tituba said
to have taught the practice of fortune telling to the girls in Rev
Parris' house. The fortune telling technique that the girls' used, as
reported by one of them to the Rev. John Hale, was an egg white in a
glass of water. This was a commonly known device in New England at the
time, and it was condemned by the Puritans as a demonic practice.
According to the Rev. Hale, one of the girls saw a "specter in the
likeness of a coffin" in the glass, and she and another girl fell into
fits. Tituba did not confess to the teaching of fortune telling; she
confessed to signing the Devil's book, flying in the air upon a pole,
seeing a cats wolves, birds, and dogs, and pinching or choking some of
the "afflicted" girls. She also said she was beaten by her owner, Rev.
Parris, and was told to confess to witchcraft, which she did -- and what
she confessed to was all culturally European, not African or
Caribbean.</p>

<p>Tituba's confession, however, did ignite a "spark" in the court,
especially when she named the other accused witches, Good and Osborne,
as her accomplices. Confession is what the judges were looking for, and
Tituba's "evidence" of a conspiracy of witches in Salem Village
stimulated the court and the girls to find and convict more people.</p>

<head><name>Mary Warren</name></head>

<p>Written By Devan Kirk </p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia</p>

<p>Spring Semester 2001</p>

<p>At the time the Salem witchcraft trials began, Mary Warren was twenty
years old and employed as a servant in the household of John Procter of
Salem Village. Before her first formal examination on April 19, 1692,
Warren participated mildly in the afflicted girls' accusations. Both
John and Elizabeth Procter disagreed with the conduct of the trials.
Therefore, when John Procter discovered that Mary Warren participated in
the accusations he threatened to whip her until her senses returned.
After Mary Warren stayed in town the night of Rebecca Nurse's
examination, Samuel Sibley went to court and testified to Procter's
opinions about the accusers and about Mary's participation in the
accusations. Sibley claimed that: "Proctor replyed if they [the
accusers] were let alone so we should all be Devils &amp; witches
quickly they should rather be had to the Whipping post but he would
fetch his jade [Mary Warren] Home &amp; thresh the Devil out of her
&amp; more to the like purpose crying hang them, hang them. And also
added that when she [Mary Warren] was first taken with fits he kept her
close to the Wheel &amp; threatened to thresh her, &amp; then she had no
more fits till the next day he was gone forth, &amp; then she must have
her fits again firsooth" (SWP II: 683-684)..</p>

<p>Both of Mary Warren's parents died before this stage in her life.
This situation forced Warren to become a servant and support herself
since she had no funds or property to claim. Some of Mary's anxiety over
the loss of her parents surfaced during the trials. The document in
which John DeRich accused George Jacobs, Sr., states, "that Mary Warrens
mother did appeare to this Deponent [John DeRich] this day with a white
man and told him that goodwife Parker and Oliver did kill her." In her
statement against Alice Parker, Mary Warren also claims that she killed
her mother and afflicted her sister, Elizabeth, "she [Alice Parker] also
told me she: bewiched my mother &amp; was a caus of her death: also
that: she bewiched my sister: Eliz: that is both deaf &amp; dumb."
Having no family and working for a man who beat her, it is not very
surprising that, when accused of witchcraft herself, Mary Warren sought
the public attention and legal protection of being an aggressive accuser
of local witches.</p>

<p>On April 19, 1692, the magistrates in Salem began their questioning
of Mary Warren. "I am innocent" were the first words out of her mouth.
At this point in the trials no one had been hanged, so the clues as to
how avoid being convicted had not yet been discovered. Mary Warren,
however, quickly learned that assertions of innocence did not save, but
following the judges' lead during questioning did help the defendant.
Warren provided many evasive answers during her first examination,
possibly because she was unsure as to how to not be convicted.
Throughout this examination she continuously fell into fits, which often
followed the fits of the other girls in the courtroom. At one point,
Mary became so afflicted by the apparitions that tortured her that she
had to be removed from the courtroom, and Bridget Bishop was then
brought in for questioning:</p>

<p>"Afterwards she [Mary Warren] started up, &amp; said I will speak
&amp; cryed out, Oh! I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it, &amp; wringed
her hands, &amp; fell a little while into a fit again &amp; then came to
speak, but immediately her Teeth were set, &amp; then she fell into a
voilet fit, &amp; cryed out, Oh Lord help me, Oh good Lord save me! And
then afterwards cryed again, I will tell, I will tell, &amp; then fell
into a dead fit againe. And afterwards cryed, I will tell, they did,
they did, they did, &amp; then fell into a violent fit again. After a
little recovery she cryed I will tell, I will tell, they brought me to
it; &amp; then fell into a fit again: which fits continuing, she was
ordered to be had out, &amp; the next to be brought in, viz: Bridget
Byshop" (SWP II: 794).</p>

<p>Even after being brought back into the courtroom, Warren continued
her fits until the magistrates held a private meeting with her. After
that, Mary Warren began to confess and, once she did, the court recorder
noted that, "not one of the sufferers was afflicted during her
examination after once she began to confess, though they were tormented
before." While in prison, Mary Warren changed her story. Her fits
lessened, and she began to implicate the Procters in the mysterious
events occurring in Salem. Following the examination in prison, Warren
faced two more examinations: one on April 21 and the other on May 12.
Now a confessed witch, Warren aggressively accused others of alliances
with the devil. At this point, Warren actively accused the Procters of
performing certain deeds, although she hesitated to call them a witch
and a wizard. By the end of her examinations, Mary was established as an
accuser, and she safeguarded her life by providing the magistrates with
ample accusations and evidence.</p>

<p>Mary Warren's testimony did more than save her life, it also
represented a turning point in the trials. For the first time fraud was
introduced. Yet the judges made no move to aid the innocent, and they
continued to encourage the accusers. In Edward Bishop, Sarah Bishop, and
Mary Easty's complaint against Mary Warren they stated that, "for Said
Mary warrin when I was Aflicted I thought I saw the Apparission of A
hundred persons: for Shee said hir Head was Distempered that Shee Could
not tell what Shee Said, And the Said Mary tould us that when Shee was
well Againe Shee Could not Say that Shee saw any of Apparissons at the
time Aforesaid -." During Warren's first examination, Elizabeth Hubbard
"testifyed that a little after this Mary was well, she then said that
the afflicted persons did but dissemble." Both of these statements
suggest that either Warren was mentally unstable, or that she and the
accusers were participating in concocted lies. Keeping in mind the above
statements, Mary's remarkable description in the prison of Giles Cory's
clothes could possibly be explained by the fact that the accusers were
"dissembling" - and not that Giles Cory was afflicting Mary at that very
moment. In Salem Story, Bernard Rosenthal claims Warren understood that
"cooperation with the accusers proved salutary" and that her decision to
become an active accuser provided a great lesson to others who would
later employ the same tactic.</p>

<head><name>John Proctor</name></head>

<p>Written by Justin Lugar, 2002</p>

<p>Of all the literature focused on the Salem witch trials of 1692, Arthur
Miller's The Crucible is the only one to treat John Proctor as the main
character.  Proctor was a major figure to be put on trial and executed
in the summer of 1692.  And although his character in The Crucible is
one of main significance, he is not portrayed in an historically
accurate manner.  Though certain features of Proctor prevail and are
consistent with the record, he is contrived to be approximately 30 years
younger in the play than his actual age of approximately 60-years-old in
1692.  To get the true story of John Proctor, one must look to other
sources including Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed,
Bernard Rosenthal's Salem Story, and Charles Upham's Salem Witchcraft.</p>

<p>John Proctor was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1632 to an
established family of farmers.  His father had left him a large estate ,
and in 1666, according to Boyer and Nissenbaum, Proctor moved near Salem
Village.  There, "he leased one of the largest farms of the area,
'Groton,' a 700-acre spread lying immediately southeast of the Village
line."  Although farming was his primary business, Proctor's wife
Elizabeth and his daughter ran a local tavern.  Thus, along with
establishing himself as a prosperous and wealthy farmer, Proctor also
diversified his economic interests by owning and operating a tavern on
Ipswich Road.  His economic standing was undoubtedly recognized within
the community even though he held no official title.  By the time of the
witch trials of 1692, Proctor was a well-established man of 60 years of
age.</p>

<p>One of Arthur Miller's innovations in The Crucible is his description of
Proctor as " a farmer in his middle thirties."  Though age and
historical fact are blurred in Miller's story, one prominent theme is
apparent concerning the character of John Proctor.  Proctor is described
on several occasions, from various sources as a strong-willed beast of a
man.  Charles Upham writes, "He was a man of Herculean frame...he had
great native force and energy...he was bold in his spirit and in his
language."  This strong character is also mentioned in Bernard
Rosenthal's Salem Story,"Proctor had argued against the reliability of
testimony from confessors...No one else had come as close as Proctor did
to forcing the issue."  Throughout the trials, Proctor stood up and
questioned the credibility of spectral evidence.  Testimony against John
Proctor revealed his true feelings of the trials.  Proctor did not
conceal his vehement opposition to the trials and is recorded remarking
about his servant Mary Warren, "he [Proctor] would fetch his jade Home &amp;
thresh the Devil out of her."  Another reference to such opposition is
found in the testimony of Joseph Pope: "this deponent heard John Proctor
Say that if mr Parish would let him have his Indian hee the s'd Procter
would soone Drive the Divell out of him."   With such strong feelings in
opposition of the court, Proctor became a prime target of accusations. 
Thus it can be stated that John Proctor directly and on several
occasions threatened the validity of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. 
Regardless of the possible implications of such actions, his fellow
inhabitants of Ipswich supported him after his arrest.</p>

<p>When facing trial
in 1692, "thirty-two Ipswich men, headed by the minister, John Wise,
signed a petition 'on behalf of our neighbors John Proctor and his wife,
now in trouble and under suspicion of witchcraft'" (B&amp;N 202).  The
petition validates the character of John Proctor and his family.  After
receiving his sentence to die on Gallows Hill on August 19.1692, Proctor
sought time to prepare for his death and secure the welfare of his
estate for future generations. </p>

<p>One of 19 victims hanged in 1692, John
Proctor embodies the legacy of innocence connected to the trials and
executions of 1692.  Proctor maintained his innocence until his death,
all the while questioning the methods of the court and its acceptance of
spectral evidence.  Because of his constant protest of the court
proceedings, Arthur Miller found John Proctor to embody many qualities
important to The Crucible.  Such a strong will to oppose the trials
proved catastrophic for Proctor and in August of 1692, he paid the
ultimate price.</p>

<p>The young Ann Putnam was the daughter of Thomas Putnam and Ann Putnam,
Sr.  She is listed in every account as one of the "afflicted girls" and
her name appears over 400 times in the court documents.  She was twelve
years old when the  Salem Witch Trials began in 1692.  By the time they
were over, she had accused nineteen people, and had seen eleven of them
hanged.</p> 

<p>Ann suffered her first fits on February 25, 1692, along with
Betty Hubbard.  During her torment, she cried out against Tituba, Sarah
Good, and Sarah Osborne.  Because Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, and
Ann Putnam, Jr. were too young to testify, their accusations had to be
endorsed by adults in the village, including her father and other
leaders in Salem Village church. Ann's court performances have become
notorious.  She and the other girls would fall to the ground and writhe
as if in agony, claiming that the specters of the accused were
tormenting them.  She would scream that she was being pinched or bitten,
choked or that her life was being threatened if she did not sign the
Devil's book.  One of many such instances is recorded in the case of
Martha Carrier: when asked, "who hurts you?" Ann replies, "Goody Carrier,
she bites me, pinches me, &amp; tells me she would cut my throat, if I did
not signe her book." As often happened in the course of the Salem
episode, there was little other evidence to convict.  Consciously or
unconsciously, Ann stuck pins into herself on more than one occasion,
claiming that the it was done by the specters of the accused.</p>

<p> Common history has painted Ann and her young peers as selfish, vicious fakers
who fueled the witchcraft trials out of boredom or spite.  This
portrait, however, is somewhat flawed as it appears that, in Ann's case
at least, the parents of the afflicted must have had a strong influence
with the child, as did the other adult accusers.  Initially, Ann was fed
names by her parents and minister.  Her father was an influential church
leader and became an aggressive accuser of witches. Her mother was a
fearful woman, still mourning the death of her infant daughter, and,
later, she claimed that she herself was attacked by witches. Though many
of the people Ann accused were those that her family or the Rev. Parris
had quarreled with, she had other sources for her accusations.  Mary
Beth Norton has recently uncovered a connection between George Burroughs
(whom Ann first accused) and Mercy Lewis, a nineteen year-old servant in
the Putnam's household.  Norton's groundbreaking research reveals the
fact that Burroughs had been minister to the Maine town of Falmouth
where both of Mercy's parents died during Indian attacks.  Moreover, the
afflicted girls seem to have entered into something of a conspiracy as
time went on, so that in the case of Burroughs the name provided by the
older Lewis was quickly echoed by Ann who initiated the accusation. </p>

<p>By the time the trials had come to an end, Ann was largely responsible for
the deaths of several "witches" including Rebecca Nurse, Mary Easty, and
George Burroughs.  Her evidence sometimes added details post-hoc, and
was crucial to the trials.  Years later, in 1706, she stood with head
bowed before the village church congregation, and the new minister, the
Rev. Joseph Green, read aloud her confession.  In this document, which
was likely written by Rev. Green, Ann begs forgiveness for her part in
the trials, saying that she was "deluded by the Devil" and wishes "to
lie in the dust".   Exactly how much guilt Ann was taking on in this
apology is questionable, since it is more tailored to mending strife in
the village than to allocating blame.  In fact, the apology served as
the spiritual testimony required to join the Puritan church and Ann was
given Communion that same day.  It is worth noting that she was the only
one of the afflicted girls to make such a retraction.   She died in
1715, unmarried.</p>

<p>Abigail Williams, aged 11 or 12 in 1692, played a major role in the
Salem Witch trials as one of the prominent accusers.  She lived with her
uncle, the Rev. Samuel Parris, Salem Village's minister.  Although it
was ordinary practice for young girls to live with relatives to learn
about housewifery, we know very little about Abigail, including where
she was born and who her parents were.</p>

<p>The traditional story about the beginning of the Salem Witch trials
tells of a "circle of young girls" practicing voodoo and fortune telling
under the direction of Samuel Parris' Indian slave, Tituba.  It is
commonly suggested that the girls were interested in fortune telling
because they wanted to know the occupation of their future husbands. 
Even though this version is perpetrated in historical works and
literature, there is no record of any sort of group fortune telling in
Parris's household or linkage between Tituba, voodoo, and the girls. 
Reverend Hale, a local minister, revealed in his 1702 work, Modest
Enquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, that he knew one of the afflicted
girls had experimented with fortune-telling in order to find out her
future husband's profession, but Reverend Hale fails to name the girl in
question.</p>

<p>Mary Beth Norton's work, In the Devil's Snare extinguished the myth
surrounding the beginning of the Salem Witch trials. According to
historical fact, both Abigail and her 9-year-old cousin Betty began
showing signs of illness in mid-January 1692.  When their behavior
turned erratic, Samuel Parris called neighboring Reverend John Hale of
Beverly to observe the two girls and their afflictions.  Reverend Hale
writes that the girls, "were bitten and pinched by invisible agents;
their arms, necks and backs turned this way and that way and returned
back again so as it was impossible for them to do of themselves and
beyond the power of any Epileptic Fits or natural Disease to effects." 
Parris and other local ministers turned to prayer and fasting in hopes
that Abigail and Betty would return to health.  When the girls' strange
behavior continued, Parris summoned Dr. William Griggs to examine them. 
Dr. Griggs determined that the girls were under the influence of an
"Evil Hand."</p>

<p>With talk of witchcraft spreading in the Village, the girls were
questioned about who was afflicting them.  On February 29th 1692, a
formal complaint was issued against Tituba, Sarah Osborne, and Sarah
Good for afflicting Betty, Abigail, and other local girls such as Ann
Putnam, Jr. who had began to suffer fits.  Abigail Williams along with
the other afflicted girls appeared at the trial hearings.  In the
presence of Good, Tituba, and Osborne Abigail suffered fits and
outbursts.  Abigail testified she "saw the apparition of said Sarah Good
at her examination pinch Elizabeth Hubbard and set her into fits and
also Elizabeth Parris and Ann Putnam, Jr."</p>

<p>Abigail's accusations continued and included complaints against Martha
Cory, George Burroughs, Bridget Bishop, Elizabeth and John Proctor,
Mary Easty, John Willard, Mary Witheridge, and Rebecca Nurse.  Overall
Abigail Williams made 41 legal complaints and gave formal testimony in seven
cases.  Bernard Rosenthal estimates she was involved in at least 17
capital cases.  It is important to remember, however, that without the
legal complaints of the adults the testimony of minors would have never
been heard in court, as unmarried women and minors had no legal standing.</p>

<p>During Elizabeth Proctor's examination, Abigail revealed she witnessed
Elizabeth's specter along with 40 other witches partake in a sacrament
of blood drinking outside of the Parris house.  She even named Sarah
Cloyce and Sarah Good as the deacons presiding over the ceremony. 
Abigail went on to accuse Elizabeth's husband John Proctor whose specter
sat on her chest at night and pinched her.  She also accused Martha
Cory's specter of tempting her to put her hand on the Devil's book.  In
addition, Rebecca Nurse's apparition tried to choke, pinch, and tempt
Abigail into the fire.  Abigail also accused Nurse of attending the
Devil's sacrament.</p>

<p>It is not clear why Abigail suffered fits and went on to accuse many
respectable people. Historians Norton and Roach speculate that it
involved the attention she received.  Young girls in Puritan society did
not receive much consideration and perhaps Abigail, displaced from her
immediate family, craved this unusual attention and authority over
adults.  It appears that some of her contemporaries were skeptical of
Abigail's behavior.  Joseph Hutchinson of Salem Village attempted to
discredit Abigail's accusations and implicitly accused her of
witchcraft.  He testified that Abigail told him that she could now talk
to the devil as well as she could converse with him.</p>

<p>Even though Abigail played a major role as an accuser at the beginning of
the trials, especially in March, April, and May, she gave her last
testimony on June 3rd 1692.  There is no historical documentation
suggesting why Abigail virtually disappeared from the court hearings. 
In addition, there are no records indicating what happened to Abigail
after the events of 1692.  It is suggested that she never married and
died a single woman, but without any evidence we will never be quite
certain.</p>

<p>Martha Cory, executed on September 22, 1692 maintained her innocence
from the time she was accused  until she was executed. Cory had
recently joined the village congregation and was known in the village as a
"gospel woman;" she seemed an unlikely victim.  Nevertheless, as Boyer
and Nissenbaum point out in their book, Salem Possessed, she did have a
questionable background that perhaps made her an easy target. More 
importantly, she challenged the validity of the witch trials themselves.</p>

<p> Over 20 years earlier, Martha had given birth to an illegitimate son, 
named Benoni (a biblical name, "son-of-sorrow), who was said to be a mulatto. 
While Martha was a respected member of the village church, everyone knew 
about this misfortunein her past.  However, soon after the witchcraft 
accusations broke out in the village, Martha spoke out against them.  She expressed
her doubts about the "afflicted" girls, and refused to join the crowds
that attended the court hearings.  She even accused the judges of gullibility.
It was not long before she herself
was accused .  She was the first person cried out against who was both a
covenanted member of the Salem village church. By accusing her, the
Putnams demonstrated that they would go after anyone who openly
questioned them. Although Mary Beth Norton in In the Devil's Snare 
suggests that Martha was accused because gossip within the church about
her illegitimate son, it as probably Martha's objection to the trials
and criticism of the girls that attracted attention and provoked the
accusations against her.  She even told one of the influential Putnam's
that "she did not think there were any witches" in New England and said
that she could "open the eyes" of the judges.</p>
<p>Martha Cory professed her
innocence in court, continually avoiding judge Hathorne's demands that
she confess. Throughout her examination on March 21, 1692, Cory makes
statements such as "I am an innocent person: "I never had to do with
witchcraft since I was born." "I am a Gospel woman." However, Cory, like
the other accused witches, were involved in a battle against the
dramatic performances of the determined girls and young women . It was
her word against the words of many, such as Edward Putnam who spoke on
behalf of Ann Putnam, Jr. with respect to Cory visiting Ann "she being
desired to come and see his daughter Ann Putnam: who had charged Martha
Cory to her face...but no sooner did Martha Cory come into the house of
Thomas Putnam but Ann Putnam fell ill in grievous fits." Despite Cory's
claims of innocence, on September 22, 1692, she ultimately lost her
battle and was executed as a witch.</p>

<p>Notes: Boyer and Nissenbaum proposed the unlikely theory that Cory was
a psychological "substitute" for Mary Veren, the recently deceased Putnam
widow who excluded the older Putnam brothers from her will. Carol
Karlsen in The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, is mistaken in saying that
Martha had no male heir who could inherit her property.</p>

<p>Little is known about the early life of John Willard.  He spent his
youth in Lancaster, Massachusetts, then moved to Groton and married
Margaret Wilkins in the 1680s.  Margaret was a third-generation member
of the large Wilkins family of Salem village.  His connection with the
Wilkins family played a large role the accusations against him.  At the
start of the trials, Willard was a deputy constable who was responsible
for helping arrest those people accused of witchcraft.  He began to
doubt the validity of the trials and the guilt of those who had been
accused.  He is said to have spoken out against the proceedings with the
words, "Hang them.  they ar all witches."  According to Robert Calef, an
author contemporary to the trials, Willard had become dissatisfied with
his job because he did not believe that everyone was guilty.  Shortly
after his reversal of opinion, Willard was accused. </p>

<p>The first
accusations came in the end of April from Ann Putnam, Jr, who stated
that Willard not only tormented her, but had also beaten her baby
sister, Sarah, to death.  Afraid of possible indictment, Willard
approached his wife's grandfather, Bray Wilkins an influential church
member for help, but Wilkins was unable to meet with Willard at that
time.  Several days later, Wilkins encountered Willard at a dinner in
Boston.  Wilkins reported that Willard "lookt after such a sort upon me
as I never before discerned in any."  Immediately after that Wilkins
found himself in great pain due to his inability to urinate.  After a
few days of suffering, Wilkins consulted a woman skilled in medicine who
told him that witchcraft was likely responsible for his distress. 
Wilkins was afraid that Willard had "done me wrong."  His suspicions
were further compounded when Wilkins returned home to find his grandson,
Daniel, deathly sick.  Daniel had earlier wished that Willard would be
hanged because of his supposed connection to witchcraft.</p>

<p>Unfortunately
for Willard, Daniel died on May 16 after Mercy Lewis and others had
claimed that they had seen him afflicting both Bray Wilkins and Daniel. 
Mercy testified that "I also saw the apperishtion of John willard there
greviously afflecting the body of Daniell wilkens who laid speechless
and in a sad condition and John willard tould me he would kill Daniell
with in Two days if he could."  The coroner's jury found evidence that
Daniel had died an unnatural death. </p>

<p>The first arrest warrant for John
Willard was issued on May 10 by John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, but
Willard had fled Salem Village in anticipation of his arrest.  This
warrant does not name any particular person as the afflicted, but most
likely refers to the accusations of Ann Putnam, Jr.  On May 15 a second
warrant was issued, this time it charged him with "sundry acts of
Witchcraft by him donne or Committed on the Bodys of Bray Wilkins and
Daniell Wilkins." </p>

<p>Willard was arrested in Groton on May 17 and underwent
examination the following day.  During this examination, Willard
maintained his innocence: "I am as innocent as the child unborn." 
During the first part of the hearing, testimony of the afflicted girls
and Wilkins family members were present.  The next part was the physical
test.  This consisted largely of spectral evidence from the girls. 
Susannah Sheldon and Mary Warren both had terrible fits when they tried
to approach Willard.  For the final part of the exam, Willard was asked
to recite the Lord's Prayer, but was unable to complete it.  Despite all
of this, Willard refused to confess at Hathorne's urging: "If it was the
last time I was to speak, I am innocent."</p>

<p> Others who contributed to
Willard's conviction include Ann Putnam, Sr. who claimed that she had
seen many ghosts who claimed that Willard had killed them; Sarah Vibber
who witnessed Lewis's affliction at the hands of Willard; and several
members of the Wilkins family.  Confessors, including Richard Carrier,
Margaret Jacobs, and Sarah Churchwell, also accused Willard of
witchcraft. </p>

<p>John Willard was hanged on August 19, 1692 along with John
Proctor, George Burroughs, George Jacobs, Sr., and Martha Carrier. 
According to Thomas Brattle, Willard died a good death, maintaining his
innocence until the end.  Bernard Rosenthal believes that Willard was
not memorialized in history like others who refused to confess because
of his reputation for beating his wife.  Willard was an honorable man in
the fact that he was not willing to compromise his integrity to save his
life, but his personal life does not appear to promote him as a hero. 
This detail is disputed by the fact that Willard quit his work as deputy
constable when he doubted the guilt of the accused - a noble move that
more than likely cost him his life.</p>

<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature</p>

<p>Mentioned in only a few documents, Mary Ireson does not emerge as one of
the leading figures in the tragedy of the Salem witch trials.  However,
the details recorded in her grand jury hearing, which has recently been
discovered, makes it possible to see how such a trial unfolds.  While
even this type of detail would not make her unusual among the accused
persons, Mary Ireson&#x0027;s court room interrogation imparts a human element
to these ruthless proceedings.  Readers can easily see the utter fear
that was gripping her -- fear not only for her life, but also fear of the
courtroom and its unknown proceedings.  The naivete that she conveys in
her responses to the interrogation is endearing, as is the obvious
sincerity with which she answers the questions.</p>

<p>The account of Ireson&#x0027;s
examination begins even before she enters the courtroom by recording
that the justices and afflicted girls joined together for a "prayer
time" before commencing the examination.  During this time of prayer,
the afflicted girls, including Elizabeth Booth, Susanna Sheldon, Mary
Walcott, and Mary Warren, fell into fits, blaming Mary Ireson, whose
interrogation was only moments away.</p>

<p> When Mary Ireson entered the
courtroom, she did so accompanied by her sister.  Whether this was an intentional
trap or not, it cleverly forced the girls to validate their claims of
having "seen" Mary Ireson's specter with their ability to then recognize
her in person and distinguish her from her sister.  The justices ordered the afflicted
girls to observe the two women and see if it was Mary or her sister who
had afflicted them, which also means that the judge himself had to have
made the distinction for the girls between Mary and her sister, possibly
foiling the Ireson's plan to trap the afflicted girls in their lies. 
The afflicted girls remained confident that it was indeed the woman
wearing the riding hood, obviously meaning Mary.  It then becomes more
likely that Mary had intentionally brought her sister in with her when
the judge then questioned Mary, saying "Do you not see how you are
discovered?"  Implied in this is her assumed aim of going
"undiscovered," of proving the afflicted girls unable to recognize her.</p>

<p>Mary responds genuinely though, saying that she might be enduring this
hardship of being accused because of some sins in her life, and she
readily admits to having been of a bad temper.  Unfortunately, this
evidence might have proved more damning than Mary ever intended, as
admissions of anger or jealousy or anything affiliated with a "bad
temper" had possibly diabolic implications within the context of
seventeenth century Puritan Salem.  She insisted, however, that while
she might have been of a "bad temper," she was not guilty of witchcraft.
 The afflicted girls then fell to the ground whenever she glanced at
them, and became normal again only when they were touched by her.  The
"touch test," as it was called, was regarded as a conclusive way of
determining who was afflicting another person  --  if they ceased their
fits and convulsions at the touch of the alleged witch, then it was that
person who was regarded as the responsible culprit.  The girls charged
Ireson with hurting them, and as they recovered from their fits, also
charged her with hurting others.</p>

<p> Mary Walcott was the only one who had
never seen Ireson before, but all the girls were certain that indeed she
was the woman who had been afflicting them.  Mary Warren said that
Ireson had brought the Devil&#x0027;s book to her to sign a month before, and
Susannah Sheldon said that even earlier that day Ireson had brought same
Devil&#x0027;s book to her and threatened that if she did not sign it she would
"tear her throat out."</p>
<p>At this point in the record of the courtroom
exchange it was noted that Mary Ireson&#x0027;s eyes were frozen as though
fixed on something in the distance.  While this could be readily
explained as Ireson&#x0027;s terror of being in a courtroom on trial for her
life, her aggressive accusers chose to explain it by saying that she was
staring at the Devil in front of her, and the afflicted girls even went
as far as to say that the Devil was making his appearance to beg her not
to confess to being a witch.  At this point, Mary Ireson&#x0027;s uncle, a man
named only as Fuller, urged her to confess and thereby "break the snare
of the devil."  While we cannot tell if her uncle was convinced that she
was guilty or if his interest was in saving his niece&#x0027;s life (as at this
point, it was understood that confessing could be equated with
surviving), his imploring only roused Mary Ireson to say that she didn&#x0027;t
know that she was even in the snare of the devil.</p>

<p>Her next words brim
with innocence, as she asked the judges if "she might be a witch and not
know it."  The court responded that that would be impossible; the judges
needed people to be aware of their own witching nature as confession was
regarded as the most significant piece of evidence.  She replied by
saying she could not confess until she was granted more insight into the
situation and the nature of her guilt. This type of manipulation is also
seen in Arthur Miller&#x0027;s play The Crucible, in which the judges bring a
person&#x0027;s private conscience into the public arena, and then use it
against them. What makes Ireson&#x0027;s trial interesting is that her
innocence and posture during the proceedings reveal to a modern audience
a woman who is most certainly innocent of witchcraft charges. However
sparsely her presence emerges in the documents, it is a significant
presence in and of itself.  The courtroom transcript reminds readers
that indeed, at the heart of this controversy, standing on the witness
stand and frequently damning themselves, are not just characters or
actors but human beings whose very lives would be taken from them as a
result of these terrifying and deliberately entrapping proceedings.</p>

<p>Sarah Churchill spent her early childhood in Saco, Maine.  Her parents
were Arthur and Eleanor Churchill and her grandfather was a
well-respected and wealthy man named Major William Phillips.  In 1680,
when Sarah was eight years old, Wabanaki Indians attacked Saco.  During
the attack, Sarah and her parents joined 50 other people in the home of
her grandfather. When the Wabanaki's arrived in Saco, they surrounded
the house and attempted to burn the settlers out of the garrison.  The
attempt failed, but they shot and injured several members of the party -
including Major Phillips.  The attack scared the Churchill  family into
moving to Marblehead, Massachusetts.  While the fate of Sarah's mother,
Eleanor, is unknown, her father Arthur lived until 1710.  By 1692 Sarah
had moved to Salem Village closer to her relatives, the Ingersolls. 
According to Mary Beth Norton, author of In the Devil's Snare, Sarah,
like several other girls who witnessed the terrors of the Indian Wars,
may have suffered from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. </p>

<p>In Salem, Sarah became the maidservant of George Jacobs Sr., who was a crippled old man
living on his prosperous farm near Salem Village. By hiring herself out
as a servant, Sarah went from being the granddaughter of one of the
wealthiest and socially prominent men in Maine (Major Phillips) to a low
status maidservant for a country farmer in Salem. </p>

<p>When the witchcraft
crisis broke out in Salem Village, Sarah was 25 years old, and she is
usually regarded as one of the circle of "afflicted girls".  But, as
Norton has pointed out, there were three  different age groups of
afflicted female accusers -- little girls, thirteen years-old and
younger;  older young people in their late teens and twenties; and
married women in their thirties and older. Sarah was related to the
18-year-old Mary Walcott, the cousin of Ann Putnam, Jr., and thereby in
a position to become acquainted with the other young accusers in the
village. When Sarah's symptoms of affliction declined, and the other
afflicted girls accused her of signing the Devil's book to avoid
torture.  In response to the accusations, Sarah confessed that her
master George Jacobs Sr. and his granddaughter, Margaret Jacobs, forced
her to sign the Devil's book.  Sarah's confession sparked a chain of
testimonies against George Jacobs Sr.  The day following Sarah's
confession, Mercy Lewis accused George Jacobs Sr. of interactions with
the Devil.  Abigail Williams, also accused Jacobs of recruiting six
people to join the ranks of the witches - Sarah Churchill, Margaret
Jacobs and her parents, as well as Phillip and Mary English. </p>

<p>During George Jacobs Sr.'s interrogation Sarah Churchill was eager to testify
that he did not conduct family prayers and that he had led a "wicked
life".  As Sarah was probably a victim of Jacobs' physical abuse, she
was quick to implicate her master.  It was said that the 80 year old,
Jacobs Sr. beat Sarah with his canes when she did not do her household
chores to his satisfaction.   Jacobs, who at the incredulous at the
accusations against him, denigrated his young accusers in court, calling
them "witch bitches." Though Churchill and justices of the Court of Oyer
and Terminer pushed Jacobs to confess, he never gave in to the
accusations against him. </p>

<p>The day following Jacob Sr.'s interrogation,
His granddaughter Margaret Jacobs confessed to being a witch and
implicated her grandfather and George Burroughs.   Margaret and Sarah
Churchill had realized that confessors lived and those who denied
witchcraft accusations against them were hanged.  The Court of Oyer and
Terminer was intent on extracting confessions from the accused so that
the confessed could reveal other witches in the community.  By May 11th,
Sarah Churchill, Margaret Jacobs, and George Jacobs Sr. were in custody
of Salem Village officials. </p>

<p>On June 1, 1692, Sarah Churchill made a
second confession to acts of witchcraft to save herself.  During this
second confession, she accused George Jacobs Sr., Ann Pudeator and
Bridget Bishop of being witches and then claimed she used "images"
brought by Ann Pudeator to torture Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam Jr. and Betty
Hubbard.  Sarah later retracted this second confession claiming that
Salem justices threatened to throw her into the "dongin" with "Mr.
Borows" if she did not confess.  Sarah Churchill was one of only two
girls to admit that she lied to save herself (the other was Mary
Warren).  Sarah is quoted, "If I told Mr. Noyes but once I had set my
hand on the Book he would believe me, but if I told the truth and said I
had not set my hand to the Book a hundred times he would not believe
me." </p>

<p>Sarah's confession saved her from hanging in Salem.  In the
aftermath of the Salem witchcraft crisis Sarah Churchill married a
weaver, Edward Andrews, in 1709 in Maine after being fined for
premarital fornication.  The last record of Sarah Churchill is dated
1731.  In comparison to the detailed treatment she receives in Norton's
book, Boyer and Nissembaum in their book, Salem Possessed, only mention
Sarah Churchill in reference to their famous map of Salem that claims
the witchcraft crisis was an economically based conflict.  Sarah
Churchill is named as one of the "afflicted girls" that Boyer and
Nissembaum fail to list on the map because they "think it a mistake to
treat the girls themselves as decisive shapers of the witchcraft
outbreak as it evolved."</p>

<p>William Stoughton was born September 30, 1631 to Israel and Elizabeth
Stoughton of Massachusetts Bay Colony.  Israel Stoughton emigrated from
England in 1633 and over time acquired a large amount of land in the
Massachusetts Bay area.  The Stoughton family lived in a part of
Massachusetts known as Dorchester.</p>

<p>William Stoughton graduated from Harvard and continued his education at
Oxford through 1660.  When he returned to the Masschusetts in 1662, he
served as a preacher for the church in Dorchester.  Stoughton's
religious education and tenure as a Puritan preacher helped him develop
a strong reverence for God and hatred for the Devil  --  both of which
would greatly influence his opinions during the Salem witch trials.</p>

<p>From 1674 to 1676 Stoughton served as Deputy President of the colony's
temporary government and also as the first Chief Justice of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court.  He was active in the political sphere in
Massachusetts Bay until 1689 when he was relieved of his duties because
it was thought that he was too closely aligned with the ousted royal
governor Edmund Andros.</p>

<p>During his life, Stoughton also served as a negotiator to the Wabanaki
Indians during the rash of raids and wars that plagued the northern
coastal towns of New England in the mid 1600s.  Stoughton was
unsuccessful in negotiating the return of several members of one such
plagued community.  He was also instrumental in the coordination of
troops and supplies sent to combat the Indians.</p>

<p>It was during the beginning of his political career that Stoughton first
made the acquaintance of renowned Boston minister the Rev. Increase
Mather.  Later, Mather would be instrumental in Stoughton's appointment
to lieutenant governor under Sir William Phips.</p>

<p>During the Salem Witch Trials, Stoughton served as Chief Justice of the
newly established court of Oyer and Terminer.  Stoughton and the other
magistrates were merciless in their questioning and condemning of the
accused.  His background in the ministry and strong hatred for the devil
enhanced Stoughton's zealous attitude and determination to eradicate
witchcraft from Salem.  Indeed "the Chief Justice, in particular appears
to have been actuated by violent prejudice against the prisoners [the
accused witches], and to have conducted the trials, all along, with a
spirit that bears the aspect of animosity" (Upham, 355).  He is
particularly remembered for his strong belief in and allowance of
spectral evidence.  In many cases this "imaginary evidence" was the only
proof that the accused was involved in witchcraft, but it was enough to
convict in Stoughton's eyes.</p>

<p>During the absence of Governor Phips, Stoughton worked tirelessly to rid
Salem of witches.  Upon his return, Phips was horrified to learn the
fate of so many of Salem's villagers.  In a letter to the main
government in England, Phips justified his actions noting the misconduct
of Stoughton.  He says, "I found that the Devill had taken upon him the
name and shape of severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my
certain knowledge of good reputation for which cause I have now
forbidden the committing of any more that shall be accused without
unavoydable necessity" (Burr, 197).  Phips condemned the use of spectral
evidence and then moved to halt all executions.  To further discredit
Stoughton Phips relates his suspicion that he was using the trials to
gain personal wealth.  Phips said that Stoughton had "indeed [hath] from
the beginning hurried on these matters with great precipitancy and by
his warrant hath caused the estates, goods and chattles of the executed
to be seized and disposed of without my knowledge or consent."  He
accused Stoughton of issuing death warrants and then seizing the
property of the condemned "witches". Phips dissolved the court of Oyer
and Terminer in October of 1692, only four months (and twenty-five
deaths) later.</p>

<p>Stoughton remained lieutenant governor after the trials ended and
surprisingly suffered no political damage for his leading role in the
crisis.  Unlike fellow magistrate Samuel Sewall, he never apologized for
his role in the conviction of the accused and the death of so many
innocent.  Stoughton remained a prominent political figure until his
death on July 7, 1701 despite his questionable part in the trials.</p>

<p>Before his death, Stoughton donated funds to his alma mater, Harvard,
with which a hall was erected in his name.  In 1726 the town of
Stoughton, Massachusetts was formally granted to the area where
Stoughton was born and raised.</p>

<p>"Accused Children in the Salem Witchcraft Crisis"</p>

<p>The witchcraft crisis in Essex County, Massachusetts in 1692 has long
been known for its unusual list of accused witches. The high proportion
of men accused of witchcraft in the crisis has been noted by historians
for decades, as has the unusual preponderance of wealthy, influential
citizens and upstanding church members.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> There is one atypical group of
accused, however, who have been largely overlooked. During the course of 
the crisis, at least eight children under the
age of twelve were accused of witchcraft, and most were indicted. This
examination of the eight cases of young children who were accused as
witches will provide a vantage point from which to examine the dynamics
of family and community that shaped the witchcraft crisis.</p>

<p>A study of the cases of these children reveals some notable common
threads. First, in all of the cases, the only evidence offered against
the children was spectral, and came from the "afflicted girls" of either
Salem Village or Andover. In no case did anyone accuse a child of
maleficium; every accuser was either an afflicted girl herself or
someone acting on her behalf. All of the eight children also ultimately
confessed to being witches while some, such as Sarah Carrier and Johanna
Tyler, went as far as to offer descriptive confessions detailing their
initiations into the service of the devil. Most notably however, every
one of the eight had an accused witch for a mother. In each instance
when a child under twelve was accused, his or her mother had been
accused at some point during the previous weeks or months. Some, but not
all, of the children's mothers had been convicted as well. The children
themselves brought out this connection in their confessions: almost all
professed that "thire mother mayd them witches."<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The cases of the
children accused of witchcraft in Salem are thus inextricably linked to
the witchcraft accusations of their mothers. A study of these unusual
cases, in conjunction with an examination of the ways in which Puritan
individuals were situated within the family and the religious sphere,
can thus offer insights into the infamous events of 1692.</p>

<p>Before discussing the cases themselves, it is important to note that it
is difficult to define a discrete category of "children" within the
crisis. Whereas a study of men as witches is obviously quite clear-cut,
it is less easy to say who was a child in the crisis of 1692, both for
reasons of documentation and because contemporary notions of who was a
"child" may have differed from modern ones. At times, it is simply
difficult to determine how old individuals were during the trials; while
a great deal of information can be gleaned from court records and other
documents, or from each town's vital records, some people are hard to
track. One young man from Manchester for example, Nicholas Frost, is
listed in various places as having been born in either 1685, 1682, or
1672.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> It is therefore possible that he fits into my category of children
under twelve and should have been included in this study, but he also
may have been as old as twenty. I therefore did not try to include him,
as his age was simply too ambiguous.</p>

<p>Additionally, my definition of a "child" as someone under twelve is
entirely artificial. To our modern sensibilities, people who are eleven
years old or younger are children. However Abigail Johnson, aged eleven
in 1692, is described as a "singlewoman" in the court records,<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>
suggesting that her "child" status can not be taken for granted. It is
unclear whether her case is substantially different from those of the
twelve- or thirteen-year-old young people who were accused of witchcraft
and who were all, at the time, considered too young to testify in
capital cases.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> I chose to view only those individuals who were under
twelve as children in order to avoid an analysis of Puritan adolescent
issues by focusing on very young children who were still clearly tied to
their parents. However it may be defined, a significant group of young
children were targeted as witches in 1692. Although the precise eight
individuals whom I have chosen to include in this group may be
debatable, the group nevertheless exists, and I believe the conclusions
I can draw from this sample are valid.</p>

<p>A brief description of each case will serve to highlight their recurring
themes and possible implications. Two of the best-documented cases of
accused children were those of Sarah Carrier and Thomas Carrier Jr. of
Andover, aged seven and ten respectively.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> The cases of the youngest
Carrier children stand as a prime example of witchcraft as linked to
family ties: their mother, Martha Carrier, was hanged as a witch a week
after their August examinations, and their older brothers, Richard and
Andrew, had confessed to witchcraft as well, albeit probably under
torture. Both Sarah and Thomas also explicitly implicated their mother
in their confessions. Thomas stated that "his Mother taught him
witchcraft" and baptized him as a witch, while Sarah emphasized that
their mother was, in fact, the primary agent acting on them: she said
her mother baptized her, and that the devil or black man was not there.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi>
The cases of the young Carrier children, then, show clearly the ways in
which children accused of witchcraft were linked directly to other
family members, most closely to their mothers.</p>

<p>Sarah Carrier named others besides her mother who were present at her
diabolical baptism, specifically "Aunt Toothaker and her cousin."<hi rfend="superscript">8</hi> Sarah
and Thomas Jr's cousin Margaret Toothaker, aged ten and living in
Billerica, was in fact another one of the accused children.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> Margaret is
unusual in that not once in the Salem court documents is she mentioned
by name. Margaret's married sister, Martha Emerson, was also an accused
witch, and she and Margaret are sometimes hard to distinguish in the
Salem records, as in a deposition against their father, an accuser makes
reference to Roger Toothaker's "Daughter."<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> However it seems clear that
another Toothaker daughter besides Martha Emerson was implicated in the
trials. One complaint, for example, lists "Toothaker" (not Emerson)
as Roger Toothaker's accused daughter, and Elizabeth Johnson, another
confessor, admits to seeing "goodwife toothaker &amp; two of Toothakers
Children" at a witch meeting. While records of Margaret's examinations
do not survive in the court records, her case is enlightening precisely
because her existence is so inextricably tied to her family. She was
referred to repeatedly as the daughter of her father or her mother, or
even as a cousin, but never as an individual, thereby highlighting the
tight linkages that existed within families. She was also unusual in
that not only her mother, but her father as well was accused of
witchcraft. Margaret Toothaker was the only small child with two parents
who were accused witches.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi></p>

<p>Another accused child with links to the Carrier family was Abigail
Johnson, who was eleven years old and lived in Andover.<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> While I was
unable to determine whether the Carriers and the Johnsons were actually
related in any way, it is clear that their families were strongly tied
to one another, at the least as neighbors in Andover. For example,
Abigail and her older brother Stephen were kept together with Sarah
Carrier as the responsibility of three Andover men in place of going to
the Salem jail.<hi rend="superscript">13</hi> There are also numerous cross-references between Johnson
and Carrier confessions; Thomas Carrier Jr. "Saw Betty Johnson in the
Company" at a witch meeting, while Elizabeth Johnson Jr. stated that
"Goody Carrier baptized her when she Baptized her Daughter Sarah."<hi rend="superscript">14</hi></p>

<p>Abigail, like Margaret Toothaker and the Carrier children, came from a
family of witches: both her mother Elizabeth Sr. and her sister
Elizabeth Jr. were accused as well, and both confessed to witchcraft.
Abigail's case is also an example of the theme of spectral torture of
"afflicted girls" that pervades the accusations of all of the children.
Martha Sprague and Abigail Martin, both teenagers who complained against
seventeen and seven people respectively, accused Abigail Johnson of
afflicting them.<hi rend="superscript">15</hi></p>

<p>Closely related to the Johnson family were Abigail's cousins Dorothy
Faulkner and Abigail Faulkner, Jr., two more children accused of
witchcraft.<hi rend="superscript">16</hi> Dorothy, who was ten, and Abigail, aged eight, also lived in
Andover. Their case returns to the theme of direct implication of
mothers in children's confessions. Abigail Faulkner Sr. was an accused
witch, and her daughters stated that "they were lead into that dreadfull
sin of witchcraft by hir meanse." Also apparently led into witchcraft by
Abigail Sr. was the last Andover child witch, Johanna Tyler, who was
eleven in 1692. Although she directly implicated only Abigail Faulkner
Sr. in her confession directly, stating that "Goode falkner P&#x0069;rswaded
her first," her mother Mary Tyler was also an accused witch.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi></p>

<p>The one remaining child accused of witchcraft in 1692 was anomalous for
several reasons. Dorcas Good was by far the youngest accused child at
age "4 or 5," with the next youngest, Sarah Carrier, being "eight years
old in November next." She was also the only child accused within Salem
Village itself. In fact, she was essentially the only child accused
outside of Andover. Margaret Toothaker lived in Billerica in 1692 but
had lived in Andover previously and had relatives there,<hi rend="superscript">19</hi> while the other
six children all lived in Andover during the trials. The timing of her
accusation was also anomalous; Dorcas was accused months before the
Andover children. Dorcas, who was often referred to as "Dorothy" in the
court records, was thus unusual among the children in her age, her place
of residence, and in when she was accused. However these differences
help to highlight the similarities that pervade all of the children's
cases, which remain in spite of divergent external circumstances.</p>

<p>Dorcas Good, like the other children, was accused exclusively by
afflicted girls: in her case, Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis, and Mary Walcott.
They accused her of spectral torment and not of maleficium, which was
the pattern in the cases of the other children as well. Dorcas also
confessed to being a witch, implicating her mother in her confession by
saying that her mother "had three birds one black, one yellow &amp; that
these birds hurt the Children and afflicted persons." Dorcas' mother,
like the mothers of all of the other accused children, was also an
accused witch; Sarah Good had been among the first to be accused and was
one of the first to be hanged.<hi rend="superscript">20</hi></p>

<p>One notable discontinuity between the different children's cases is that
some of their mothers confessed to being witches while others denied the
charges against them. Martha Carrier and Sarah Good maintained their
innocence and were hanged, while Abigail Faulkner, Sr., Elizabeth
Johnson, Sr., Mary Toothaker, and Mary Tyler all confessed to being
witches.<hi rend="superscript">21</hi> This factor seems to have had little effect on the plight of
their children. During the Salem witchcraft crisis everyone who was
accused was presumed guilty; magistrates asked leading questions, and
those who insisted upon their innocence, at least during the earlier
trials, were generally executed. In such an environment, a confession or
the lack thereof did not greatly affect other people's perceptions of an
individual as a witch. Children of confessed witches and those whose
mothers insisted on their innocence alike were suspected and often
accused of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Thus common themes appear in each of the cases of children accused of
witchcraft. Sarah and Thomas Carrier, Margaret Toothaker, Abigail
Johnson, Dorothy and Abigail Faulkner, Johanna Tyler, and Dorcas Good
were all accused by afflicted girls, they all confessed to being
witches, all had mothers who were believed to be witches, whether
confessed or not, and many implicated their own mothers in their
confessions.</p>

<p>An important point to bear in mind in examining the witchcraft cases of
young children is that the notion of a child as a witch did not
contradict Puritan belief.  Particularly in the unusual case of Salem,
witches and children alike were seen as easily influenced and potential
or existing conduits for the devil. Whereas more typical witchcraft
cases tended to include accusations of maleficium and therefore were
targeted more at older individuals with negative reputations in the
community, the focus in Salem was on spectral torment. A witch in Salem
was thus primarily defined as one who had made a covenant with the
devil. He or she was perceived as working with him to afflict other
individuals, often with the intent of coercing them to make a diabolical
covenant as well. Because the devil worked through people in this way,
no prior experience or knowledge was necessary to make someone a witch;
thus the notion of very young, uneducated children as potent witches was
perfectly compatible with Puritan belief. Cotton Mather stated this
directly, remarking, "Are they Young? Yet the Devil has been with them
already&#x004F; They go astray as soon as they are born."<hi rend="superscript">22</hi></p>

<p>Puritan children were also often viewed as religiously precocious by the
adults around them. Children were surrounded by deep and pervasive
religious belief from the time of their births. For this reason, adults
assumed a fairly high level of theological understanding in children at
a very young age. The modern historian Levin Schucking notes that "A
child who, like little John Ruskin preached sermons about 'Dod' from a
kitchen chair, was not only a frequent and typical phenomenon in the
Puritan nursery but for nearly three centuries an extremely popular
one."<hi rend="superscript">23</hi>  Puritan children were thus considered in many ways to possess a
good understanding of religious principles. Compounded with the little
theological knowledge that was expected in a believable witch, this fact
meant that the notion of children as witches was not at all incongruous
in Puritan belief.</p>

<p>In fact, Puritan practice may have made children more likely than adults
in some ways to actually believe that they were witches. The historian
Judith Graham notes that "Puritan girls and boys grew up in a culture
that relentlessly required them to confront their sinfulness, and to
contemplate the possibility of being separated from the regenerate and
condemned to the palpable horrors of hell."<hi rend="superscript">24</hi> Puritan doctrine may thus
have worked with childhood fears to convince children of their own
inherent immorality and unworthiness. In such a context, it is hardly
surprising that children as young as five or seven could convince
themselves that their "sinfulness" had been translated into direct
collaboration with the devil. The children's confessions from 1692
support this assumption.</p>

<p>More contemporary support comes from the Reverend Francis Dane, who was
the father of Elizabeth Johnson Sr. and Abigail Faulkner Sr. He was thus
intimately connected to the accused children and was unsurprisingly a
critic of the trials.<hi rend="superscript">25</hi> He made almost precisely this point about
childhood fear, writing that in the case of "some Children we have cause
to feare that dread has overcome them to accuse themselves in that they
knew not."<hi rend="superswcript">26</hi> Even at the time of the trials, then, it was clear to some
people that  Puritan religious belief in general, and the witchcraft
crisis in particular, may have been frightening the accused children
into making confessions motivated primarily by fear. Children would have
been likely, therefore, to confess to crimes that were already credible
according to Puritan beliefs about both witchcraft and childhood.</p>

<p>The institution of the family was integral in Puritan society as well,
occupying a central role in personal identity and spiritual well-being.
Very visibly in the court documents, individuals are referred to through
their linkages to others, as "wife of," "daughter of" or "son of." This
is most true of women and children, who were almost invariably linked to
family members for their identities. Notably, while women were always
mentioned in connection with their husbands, children were not always
described in terms of their fathers. Rather, particularly in the cases
of children accused of witchcraft, the children were frequently referred
to as the daughters of their mothers, as in "Dorrithy good Sarah goods
daughter" or "dorritye Forknor and Abigale Forknor children: to Abigall
Farknor."<hi rend="superscript">27</hi> This implicit alliance of children with their mothers has
important implications for the way that conclusions were drawn and
accusations made. As Richard Baxter wrote in 1673, "So it is an evident
truth, that most of the mischiefs that now infest or seize upon mankind
throughout the earth, consists in, or are caused by the disorders and
ill-governedness of families."<hi rend="superscript">28</hi> Family "governedness," in turn was the
provenance of parents, particularly of mothers. Thus if children were
identified with their accused-witch mothers, witchcraft would have been
perceived as a family disorder.</p>

<p>Even more specifically, Schucking states that "Religion is for the
Puritan family religion. Divine worship is, not incidentally but
primarily, family worship."<hi rend="superscript">29</hi> Thus not only were families tightly linked
units in terms of general characteristics, but religious practices were
interpreted as especially family-bound. The children's confessions in
which they accused their mothers offer compelling support for this
point. Sarah Carrier said, "My mother, she made me set my hand to a
book," Thomas Carrier related how "his Mother baptized him in the
ShawShin River," Dorcas Good confessed that her mother had given her a
little snake as a familiar, and the Faulkner sisters stated that "thire
mother apared and mayd them witches."<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> Witchcraft was thus an inversion
of Puritan doctrine, in which adherents followed the devil instead of
God but in which the primary means of initiation was the same. Just as
Puritans believed that religion must be learned and experienced within
the family, so witchcraft was viewed as being transmitted through the
family, and especially from a witch mother to her closely-connected
children.</p>

<p>Witchcraft accusations of young children at Salem thus serve to
highlight the strength and focuses of Puritan belief. They are therefore
perfectly explicable in these terms. In many ways, it is possible to
view the Puritan conception of witch mothers and children as the natural
result as well as the inversion of the ideal Puritan mother and child
relationship. Accused children, like ideal children, were religiously
precocious, but they babbled confessions instead of sermons and
covenanted with the devil instead of with God. Accused mothers, like
ideal mothers, imparted their religion to their children, thereby
ensuring one destiny or another for their children's souls. The thin
line between ideal Puritanism and virulent witchcraft is exemplified in
one statement from the confession of Sarah Carrier, in which she
describes how her mother directly forced her into being a witch.
Although Sarah never suggests that a minister performed her baptism,
taken out of context, the sentence could almost refer to either
diabolical or divine practice: "She said her mother baptized her, and
her mother said when she baptized her, thou are mine for ever and ever
and amen."<hi rend="superscript">31</hi> The witchcraft accusations of children in the witchcraft
crisis of 1692 can thus serve to exemplify Puritan notions of
witchcraft, religion, and family relations. These ideas, in turn, can be
applied not only to the cases of children, but to developing an
understanding of the crisis as a whole.</p>

<head>"The Untold Story of <name>Mary Ayer Parker</name>: Gossip and Confusion in 1692"</head>

<p>Written by Jacqueline Kelly (copyright, 2005></p>
<p> History 209,  An Undergraduate Course, Cornell University</p>
<p>Spring Semester, 2003</p>
<p>Revised for presentation at the Berkshire Conference, June, 2005</p>

<p>In September1692, Mary Ayer Parker of Andover came to trial in Salem
Massachusetts, suspected of witchcraft.  During her examination she was
asked, "How long have ye been in the snare of the devil?" She responded,
"I know nothing of it."  Many people confessed under the pressure of the
court of Oyer and Terminer, but she asserted they had the wrong woman.
"There is another woman of the same name in Andover,"<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> she proclaimed. 
At the time, no one paid much attention.   Mary Ayer Parker was
convicted and hanged by the end of the month.  Modern historians have
let her claim fall to the wayside as well, but what if she told the
truth?  Was there another Mary Parker in Andover?  Could it be possible
that the wrong Mary Parker was executed?  We know little about the Mary
Parker of 1692.  Other scholars presumed her case was unimportant-but
perhaps that assumption was wrong.</p>

<p>The end of her story is recorded for every generation to see, but the
identity of this woman remained shrouded in mystery for over three
centuries.  We still don't know why she was accused in 1692.  Puritan
women were not particularly noteworthy to contemporary writers and
record-keepers.  They appeared occasionally in the court records as
witnesses and plaintiffs but their roles were restricted to the house
and family. Mary Parker was a typical Puritan wife.  She appeared in the
records only in birth notices and the records associated with the will
of her late husband Nathan Parker.  Notably, the records included no
legal trouble at all, for witchcraft or anything else.</p>

<p>John and Hannah Ayer gave birth to their daughter Mary sometime in the
early to mid 1600's.  Mary and her siblings may have been born in
England, and later moved to North America with their parents.  The Ayers
moved several times during the early stages of their settlement in
America but resettled for the last time in 1647 in Haverhill.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>

<p>The family was apparently of some prominence.  Tax records from 1646
showed that John Ayer possessed at least one hundred and sixty pounds,
making him one of the wealthiest settlers in Haverhill.</p>

<p>Mary Ayer married Nathan Parker sometime before her father's death in
1657.  Although no marriage record survived in the hometowns of either
Nathan or Mary, the wording of her father John Ayer's will made it
obvious that she was married with children when it was written.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>  
Nathan married his first wife Susanna Short on November 20, 1648.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>  
Within the next three years, the couple relocated to Andover, where she
soon after died on August 26, 1651.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi>   Andover's Vital Records listed
the birth of Nathan and Mary Parker's first son John in 1653.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi>  Nathan
could have remarried and had children within the two years after the
death of his first wife.</p>

<p>Mary and Nathan marriage was not documented but we do know Nathan and
his brother Joseph settled in Newbury, Massachusetts sometime in the
early 1630's.  They settled in Andover where they were amongst its first
settlers.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi>  Nathan came over from England as an indentured servant<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>,
but eventually he became rather wealthy in Andover.  The original size
of his house lot was four acres but the Parker's landholdings improved
significantly over the years to 213.5 acres.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> His brother Joseph, a
founding member of the Church, possessed even more land than his
brother, increasing his wealth as a tanner.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> By 1660, there were forty
household lots in Andover, and no more were created.  The early
settlers, including the Parkers, would be those of importance.  By 1650,
Nathan began serving as a constable in Andover.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi>  By the time he
married Mary Ayer, his status was on the rise.  It continued to do so
during the early years of their marriage as he acquired more land.</p>

<p>Mary and Nathan continued to have children for over twenty years after
the birth of John Parker in 1653.  Mary bore four more sons: James in
1655, Robert in 1665, Peter in 1676, and a son Joseph.<hi rend="superscript">12</hi>  She and Nathan
also had four daughters: Mary, born in 1660 (or 1657)<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>, Hannah in 1659,
Elizabeth in 1663, and Sara in 1670.  James died on June 29, 1677,
killed in an Indian skirmish at Black Point.<hi rend="superscript">14</hi>  Robert died in 1688 at
the age of 23.  Hannah married John Tyler in 1682.<hi rend="superscript">15</hi>  Nathan and Mary's
daughter Elizabeth married John Farnum in 1684.</p>

<p>When Nathan died on June 25, 1685, he left an ample estate to his wife
and children.<hi rend="superscript">16</hi> Mary Ayer Parker brought an inventory of the estate to
court in September of the same year, totaling 463 pounds and 4
shillings.  The court awarded her one-third of the house and lands,
equal shares to Robert, Joseph, Peter, Hannah, Elizabeth, and Sarah, and
a double share to John.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi>  Mary Parker widow obtained an estate of over
154 pounds-a good amount of money in the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Mary Parker did not appear in Essex County records after September 29,
1685 when she brought the inventory to court.  We know little about her
interaction with her neighbors and the community after her husband's
death.   The Parkers were a respectable family that continued to root
itself in the community.  So why, less than a decade after her husband's
death, was Mary accused as a witch?  There was no documented friction
with any of her neighbors, any no prior accusations.  The closest tie
Mary had with witchcraft was a distant cousin on her father's side,
William Ayers whose his wife Judith was accused of witchcraft in 1662.<hi rend="superscript">18</hi>
 But this was not enough to justify Mary's accusation.  What really
happened in 1692 to Mary Ayer Parker?</p>

<p>The Salem crisis had spread to Andover when William Barker Jr. named her
in his confession on September 1, 1692.<hi rend="superscript">19</hi>  He testified that "goode
Parker went w'th him last Night to Afflict Martha Sprague."  He
elaborated that Goody Parker "rod upon a pole &amp; was baptized at 5 Mile
pond," a common reference to a union made with the devil.  The
examination of Mary Parker occurred the next day.  At the examination,
afflicted girls from both Salem and Andover fell into fits when her name
was spoken.  The girls included Mary Warren, Sarah Churchill, Hannah
Post, Sara Bridges, and Mercy Wardwell.  The records state that when
Mary came before the justices, the girls were cured of their fits by her
touch-the satisfactory result of the commonly used "touch test,"
signifying a witch's guilt.<hi rend="superscript">20</hi></p>

<p>When Mary denied being the witch they were after Martha Sprague, one of
her accusers, quickly responded that is was for certain this Mary
Parker, who had afflicted her.  Sprague and Mary Lacy effectively fell
into fits.  Historian Mary Beth Norton discovered that Mary Parker was
related to Sprague; she was Sprague's step-great-aunt.<hi rend="superscript">21</hi>   Mary Parker's
son-in-law John Tyler's father Moses Tyler had married Martha's
mother.<hi rend="superscript">22</hi>  Martha also lived in Andover, and the Tylers and the Parkers
were friendly for sometime before their families were joined in
marriage.<hi rend="superscript">23</hi>  Still, it was a distant relation and Martha was only
sixteen years old at the time of the trial, so it is doubtful she knew
Mary Parker personally.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mary Parker's defense was ignored, both by the courtroom,
and most historians until now.   However, Mary Ayer Parker told the
truth: there was another Mary Parker living in Andover.  In fact there
were not one, but three other Mary Parkers in Andover.  One was Mary
Ayer's sister-in-law, Mary Stevens Parker, wife of Nathan's brother
Joseph.  The second was Joseph and Mary's daughter Mary.  The third was
the wife of Mary and Joseph's son, Stephen.  Mary Marstone Parker
married Stephen in 1680.<hi rend="superscript">24</hi>  To complicate things even further, there was
yet another Mary Parker living nearby in Salem Towne.</p>

<p>Confusion could easily have arisen from the multitude of Mary Parkers
abound in Essex County.  However, similarities between Mary Ayer Parker
and her sister-in-law may have instigated confusion in even her
accusers.  The two Mary's married the Parker brothers by the late
1640's, and began having children in the early 1650's.  They had
children of the same name including sons named Joseph and daughters Mary
and Sara (Mary, daughter of Nathan and Mary may have died soon after her
father <hi rend="superscript">25</hi>).  Nathan and Mary Parker's son James, born in 1655, and
Joseph and Mary Parker's son John born in 1656, died on June 29, 1677,
killed by the Indians at Black Point.<hi rend="superscript">26</hi>  In 1692, both Mary Parker Sr.'s
were reasonably wealthy widows.  Joseph's wife received their house and
ample land from his will, dated November 4, 1678.<hi rend="superscript">27</hi> The two women
shared almost fifty years of family ties.  But in September of 1692, it
was only Nathan Parker's wife who was accused, tried, and found guilty
of witchcraft.  Why was Mary Ayer brought to trial?</p>

<p>On the surface, the two Mary Parkers seemed almost interchangeable but
the will of Joseph Parker revealed something important about his branch
of the Parker family.   Joseph made some peculiar stipulations regarding
the inheritance of his son Thomas.  The will described Thomas as "who by
god's providence is disenabled for providing for himself or managing an
estate if committed to him by reason of distemper of mind att certain
seasons."<hi rend="superscript">28</hi>  The management of his portion of the estate was given to
his mother Mary until her death, after which, Thomas would choose his
own guardian.</p>

<p>This "distemper of mind" seemed to run in the family.  Stephen Parker
later petitioned in September 1685 that his mother be barred from the
management of her own affairs for the same reason.  Stephen revealed
that his mother was in a "distracted condition and not capable of
improving any of her estate for her owne comfort."<hi rend="superscript">29</hi>  Whether mental
illness influenced the reputation of Joseph Parker's wife cannot be
ascertained, but it is likely that if she was mentally instable, it was
well known in the tight-knit community of Andover.</p>

<p>Mental illness was often distrusted and feared.  In fact, a case in 1692
involved a woman with a history of mental illness.  Rebecca Fox Jacobs
confessed to witchcraft in 1692 and her mother Rebecca Fox petitioned
both the Court of Oyer and Terminer and Massachusetts Governor Phips for
her release on the grounds of mental illness.  According to her mother,
it was well known that Rebecca Jacobs had long been a "Person Craz'd
Distracted &amp; Broken in mind."<hi rend="superscript">30</hi>  Evidently mental illness could have
made someone more vulnerable to witchcraft accusations.  This does not
guarantee the girls intended to accuse Mary Stevens Parker but it does
make the case for Mary Ayer Parker's misidentification stronger.</p>

<p>A notorious figure in Salem Towne, also named Mary Parker muddled the
case further.  This Mary Parker appeared multiple times in the Essex
courts and made a reputation for herself beginning in 1670's.  In 1669,
she was sentenced for fornication.<hi rend="superscript">31</hi>  In 1672, the court extended her
indenture to Moses Gillman for bearing a child out of wedlock.  A year
later, she went back to court for child support from Teague Disco of
Exiter.<hi rend="superscript">32</hi>  The court sentenced her ten stripes for fornication.  She
came to trial two more times for fornication in 1676 <hi rend="superscript">33</hi>. A scandalous
figure indeed, Mary from Salem further sullied the name "Mary Parker."</p>

<p>A disreputable name could have been enough to kill the wrong woman in
1692.  In a society where the literate were the minority, the spoken
word was the most damaging.  Gossip, passed from household to household
and from town to town through the ears and mouths of women, was the most
prevalent source of information.  The damaged reputation of one woman
could be confused with another as tales of "Goode So-and-so" filtered
though the community.  The accused Sarah Bishop had a history of
witchcraft suspicions, especially concerning the death of Christian
Trask.  Her death, ruled a suicide, remained a controversy and many
believed that Sarah Bishop had bewitched her.<hi rend="superscript">34</hi>  The Court of Oyer and
Terminer questioned Sarah on April 22, 1692, but the "Goode Bishop"
business did not stop there.  Susanna Sheldon, joining the cast of
afflicted girls, claimed that she saw Bridget Bishop in an apparition
who told her she killed three women, one of them being Christian
Trask.<hi rend="superscript">35</hi>  Sarah and Bridget lived in different parts of Salem but
Susanna wrongly attributed gossip about Sarah Bishop to Bridget Bishop
simply because they shared a last name.  The confusion associated with
their cases proved how easily gossip could be attributed to the wrong
woman.  The bad reputations garnered by Mary Parker the fornicator from
Salem, and the mentally ill Mary Stevens Parker of Andover could have
affected the vulnerability of Mary Ayer Parker.</p>

<p>Mary Ayer Parker told the truth about the other Marys, but the court
ignored her. William Barker Jr. came in to speak against her.  He
testified "looking upon Mary Parker said to her face that she was one of
his company, And that the last night she afflicted Martha Sprague in
company with him."<hi rend="superscript">36</hi>  Barker Jr. pointed Mary out in court but he may
have been confused himself.  In his own confession, William accused a
"goode Parker," but of course, he did not specify which Goody Parker he
meant.<hi rend="superscript">37</hi>  There was a good possibility that William Barker Jr. heard
gossip about one Goody Parker or another and the magistrates of the
court took it upon themselves to issue a warrant for the arrest of Mary
Ayer Parker without making sure they had the right woman in custody.</p>

<p>Mary Parker's luck plummeted when Mary Warren suffered a violent fit in
which a pin ran through her hand and blood came from her mouth during
her examination.  Indictments followed for the torture and other evil
acts against Sarah Phelps, Hanna Bigsbee, and Martha Sprague.  Martha's
indictment was rejected, returned reading "ignoramus,"<hi rend="superscript">37</hi> but the
indictments for both Hannah Bigsbee and Sarah Phelps were returned
"billa vera", and the court held Mary Parker for trial.  Sara claimed
that Mary tortured her on the last day of August as well as "diverse
other days and times."  Hannah said that Mary tortured her on the first
day of September: the indictment stated that she had been "Tortured
aflicted Consumed Pined Wasted and Tormented and also for Sundry othe[r]
Acts of Witchcraft."<hi rend="superscript">39</hi></p>

<p>Capt. Thomas Chandler approved both indictments.  Significantly both
Sarah and Hanna were members of the Chandler family, one of the founding
families in Andover.  The Captain's daughter Sarah Chandler married
Samuel Phelps on May 29, 1682.  Their daughter Sara Jr. testified
against Mary Parker in 1692.<hi rend="superscript">40</hi>  Hannah Chandler, also the daughter of
Capt. Thomas, married Daniel Bigsbee on December 2, 1974.<hi rend="superscript">41</hi>  Capt.
Thomas Chandler's daughter Hannah and granddaughter Sarah.gave evidence
that held Mary for trial.  Did the Chandler family have it out for the
Parkers?</p>

<p>Thomas and his son William settled in Andover in the 1640s.<hi rend="superscript">42</hi>  Elinor
Abbot wrote that they originally came from Hertford, England.<hi rend="superscript">43</hi>  The
revelation of strong Chandler ties to Mary's case is peculiar because
until then, the relationship between the Parkers and the Chandlers
seemed friendly.  Public and private ties between William, Thomas, and
the Parker brothers were manifest in the public records.  Nathan and
William Chandler held the responsibility of laying out the land lots,
and probably shared other public duties as well.<hi rend="superscript">44</hi>   Joseph Parker's
will called Ensigne Thomas Chandler<hi rend="superscript">45</hi> his "loving friend", and made him
overseer of his estate.<hi rend="superscript">46</hi>  Nathan Parker's land bordered Thomas
Chandler's and there was no evidence of neighborly disputes.<hi rend="superscript">47</hi>  It is
difficult to understand where the relationship went bad.</p>

<p>The only hint of any fallout between the families came more than a
decade before Joseph Parker's 1678 will.  On June 6, 1662, Nathan Parker
testified in an apprenticeship dispute between the Tylers and the
Chandlers.<hi rend="superscript">48</hi>  The Chandler family may have felt Nathan Parker unfairly
favored the Tyler family in the incident.  Bad blood between the
Chandler and Tyler families could have translated into problems between
the Chandler and Parker families.  This discord would have been worsened
by the alliance between the Tyler and Parker families through Hannah
Parker and John Tyler's marriage in 1682.</p>

<p>This still does not seem enough to explain the Chandlers' involvement
1692.  Perhaps after Nathan Parker's death in 1685, neighborly tensions
arose between Mary's inherited state and the bordering Chandler estate. 
The existing records betray nothing further. Perhaps these speculated
neighborly problems were coupled with the desire to distract attention
from an internal scandal in the Chandler family.</p>

<p>In 1690 Hannah and Daniel Bigsbee testified in the trial of Elizabeth
Sessions, a single woman in Andover who claimed to be pregnant with the
child of Hannah's brother Joseph.  The Bigsbees refuted her claim and
insisted she carried the child of another man.<hi rend="superscript">49</hi>  The Chandlers were
respected people in Andover; even Elizabeth referred to them as "great
men," and they surely resented the gossip. The crisis of 1692 was a
perfect opportunity for them to divert attention away from the scandal. 
When Mary Parker was arrested, they found the ideal candidate to take
advantage of: her husband and her brother-in-law were no longer around
to defend her and her young sons could not counter the power of the
Chandlers.</p>

<p>After the initial indictments, Hannah Bigsbee and Sarah Phelps dropped
from documented involvement in the case.  Here, the documentation gets
rather sloppy and confused.  Essex Institute archivists erroneously
mixed much of the testimony from Alice Parker's case in with Mary
Parker's.  When the irrelevant material is extracted, there is very
little left of the actual case.<hi rend="superscript">50</hi></p>

<p>The only other testimony came from two teenage confessors: Mercy
Wardwell and William Barker Jr.  On September 16, fourteen-year-old
Barker told the Grand Inquest that Mary "did in Company with him s'd
Barker : afflict Martha Sprag by: witchcraft. the night before: s'd
Barker Confessed: which was: the 1 of Sept'r 1692".<hi rend="superscript">51</hi>  Eighteen-year-old
Mercy did not name Mary a witch, but did say that "she had seen: the
shape of Mary Parker: When she: s'd Wardwell: afflicted: Timo Swan:
also: she: s'd she saw: s'd parkers Shape: when the s'd wardwell
afflicted Martha Sprage".<hi rend="superscript">52</hi></p>

<p>Nothing else remains of Mary Parker case.  It appeared that Mary's trial
was over on September 16, 1692.  She was executed only six days later. 
Evidence seems lacking.  In essence, Mary was convicted almost solely
from the testimony from two teenage confessors.  Her examination,
indictment, and grand inquest all took place expediently, and within one
month, Mary was accused, convicted and executed.</p>

<p>Her death seems irresponsible at the least, and even almost outrageous. 
She was convicted with such little evidence, and even that seems tainted
and misconstrued.  The Salem trials did her no justice, and her
treatment was indicative of the chaos and ineffectualness that had over
taken the Salem trials by the fall of 1692.  However, her treatment by
historians is even less excusable.  The records of her case are
disorganized and erroneous, but what has been written about the case is
even more misinformed.  Today it is impossible to exonerate the
reputation of Mary Ayer Parker.  The records that survive are too
incomplete and confused.  But perhaps we can acknowledge the possibility
that amidst the fracas of 1692, a truly innocent woman died as the
result of sharing the unfortunate name "Mary Parker."</p>

<p>3. The will of John "Eyer" of Haverhill can be found in <title level="m">Essex County
Records</title> Volume III. 200-201. The will stipulated that if Mary died
before she received her inheritance, it would pass to her children.  The
same was said for her sister Rebecca.  However, if her other siblings
Nathaniel and Hannah died before they received similar bequests and left
no children, their shares would pass to their brother Obadiah  If
Nathaniel and Hannah had children when the will was written I assume
their father would have made the same stipulations regarding the passing
of their inheritance to their children.  Birth records from Essex County
listing at least two children of Nathan and Mary before 1657 back this
claim up.</p>

Robert and James have died-Robert of unknown causes and James by the
Indians at Black Point.</p>

<p>13. There are two Mary Parkers listed as daughters in the Vital Records
of Andover, born three years apart in 1657 and 1660.  They could be of
the same parents, with one dying before the birth of the other-in fact
Nathan's first daughter Mary died in 1676 and I believe they did have
another daughter after her death and named her, too, Mary.  However, I
suspect that one of the Mary's listed here was mistakenly identified,
and was actually the daughter of Joseph and Mary Parker, who have
children in the same time period.  This speculation comes from the will
of Joseph Parker, which listed a daughter Mary Parker although she is
unlisted in the birth records.</p>

Parker.  However, I speculate that this will actually belongs to his son
Nathan Jr., who seemed to have died around the same time.  I am
convinced because first, the record is from Newbuy, where Nathan Jr. was
born and lived, and secondly, because the will mentions only one child,
Mary.</p>

<head>Spectors, Maleficium, and <name>Margaret Scott</name> </head>

<p>Written by Mark Rice (Copyright, 2005)</p> 
<p>History 209, An Undergraduate Court, Cornell University</p>
<p> Spring Semester, 2003</p> 
<p>Revised for presentation to the Berkshire Conference, 2005</p>

<p> Margaret Scott possessed the
characteristics that made her a prime suspect for any witch accusation
during early New England.  However, Scott was unlucky enough to be
accused during the Salem witch hunts.  As a result, Scott, an orthodox
suspect, was thrown into a very unorthodox witch hunt with very little
chance of survival.  The evidence of Margaret Scott's case highlights
the nature of witchcraft accusations in New England and the Salem witch-hunt.  In
the end, Margaret Scott was accused and executed on charges of
witchcraft due to prolonged suspicion of her character, the spectral
evidence provided in her trial, the maleficium evidence against her, and
the prominence of the accusers in her community.</p> 

<p>Margaret Scott was the only person to be accused of being a witch from 
Rowley during the Salem trials.  This was mainly due to the fact that 
community members long thought of her as a witch.  She most likely was 
suspected of witchcraft because of her low stature in the community, 
the number of child fatalities,long widowhood, and begging; all common traits 
among people accused of witchcraft.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p> 

<p>Margaret Scott's origins are obscure.  Born Margaret
Stevenson in England somewhere around the year 1615, she first appeared
in the record books in 1642, when she married Benjamin Scott.  Initially
the Scotts lived in Braintree, but later moved to Cambridge where they
had four children between 1644 and 1650.  The Scott family arrived in
Rowley in 1651 where Margaret gave birth to three additional children. 
Of all the children, only three lived to adulthood.  Still, by the time
of the witchcraft trials, the seventy-seven year-old Margaret Scott had 
as many as eleven grandchildren.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p> 

<p>It is hard to pinpoint the status of the Scott family
among the residents of Rowley.  Evidence from Essex County records
indicates that the Scots were not wealthy and never appeared in any
positions suggesting importance or prominence.  Benjamin Scott himself
was never assigned a high-status title such as Mister or even the lower
status title Goodman. The Scotts lacked the money to purchase their own
land.  Instead in 1664 the town donated land to Benjamin Scott.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> In
March of 1665, Benjamin Scott was convicted of the crime of theft, for
which he was "fined and admonished."  However, six months later he took
the Freeman's Oath, indicating he was both a householder and a church
member, in short, an upstanding person.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>  Benjamin Scott died in 1671
leaving an estate worth only 67 pounds and 17 shillings, not much by the
standards of that time.  However, Margaret had to live on this estate
for the next twenty-one years and by the time of the Salem trials, must
have been very poor.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi></p> 

<p>At first glance, Margaret Scott seems to have
lived an uneventful life.  However, certain aspects of her character
made her a very likely candidate as a witch suspect.  One such aspect
was the high infant mortality rate among her children.  Women in New
England who had trouble raising children were very vulnerable to
witchcraft charges.  In fact, only 7 out of the 62 accused female
witches in New England prior to 1692 had a considerable number of
children.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi></p> 

<p>Out of Margaret's seven children, only three made it to
adulthood.  This does not consider any miscarriages or other problems
that Scott may have had.  Furthermore, only one of her three children
born in Rowley lived to adulthood.  The residents of Rowley would have
been well aware of her high infant mortality rate.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi></p> 

<p>Another factor
about Margaret Scott's character that made her vulnerable to accusations
was her status as a widow for twenty-one years.  Being a widow did not
in itself expose a woman to suspicion.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>  However, Scott suffered from
the economic and social effects of being a widow for a prolonged period.
The most dangerous aspect of being a widow was the lack of a husband
for legal support and influence.  Also, Scott, 56 at the time of her
husband's death, was forced to live off her husband's small estate for
twenty-one years.  Often widows who were over fifty and not wealthy,
were unable to find a new spouse and thus were reduced to poverty and
begging.  By begging, Margaret would expose herself to witchcraft
suspicions according to what historian Robin Briggs calls the "refusal
guilt syndrome".  This phenomenon occurred when a beggar's needs were
refused causing feelings of guilt and aggression on the refuser's part. 
The refuser projected this aggression on the begger and grew suspicious
of her.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi></p> 

<p>Some of the depositions against Scott did involve misfortunes
occurring to people who had denied her a service or good.  Perhaps Scott
actually used her reputation to receive favors, which could be very
effective.  If people believed that Scott was a witch, they might have
eagerly given her what she asked out of fear of retaliation.  However,
if someone refused Scott and then fell on bad circumstances, witchcraft
suspicions and accusations were almost a certainty.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi></p> 

<p>Evidence suggests
that Scott's widowhood suffering and dependence on begging resulted in
part from a lack of familial support. Only Margaret Scott's son Benjamin
stayed in Rowley.  When Margaret Scott was accused of witchcraft,
Benjamin, who had six children of his own at the time, offered no legal
support.  He probably lacked the time and money to pursue a legal
defense of his mother.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> </p> 

<p>A careful examination of the depositions and
witnesses shows a clear pattern among Margaret Scott's accusers.  Many
who were wealthy residents of the town who cooperated in the effort to
convict Margaret of witchcraft. </p>

<p>Captain Daniel Wicom appeared as the
central figure among the accusers.  As a prominent
member of Rowley, any witchcraft affliction that involved Wicom, who
filled many town leadership positions, would have led to legal action
against Scott.<hi rend="superscript">12</hi>  According to depositions presented against Scott, the
residents of Rowley suspected her of being a witch for as many as twenty
years but no action was taken until his daughter became afflicted by
her. </p>

<p>The Wicoms were not the only prominent family of Rowley involved
with the accusations against Margaret Scott.  The Nelson family also
played an active role in the trial.  Thomas and Phillip Nelson were
brothers; Sarah was Philip's wife.  Their father, Captain Philip Nelson,
passed away in 1691 leaving an estate of 500 pounds suggesting that both
Thomas and Philip were well off themselves.  Unfortunately, records fail
to distinguish between Philip the father and Philip the son.  However,
the prominence of the name of Philip Nelson in town records suggests
that the family was wealthy and powerful.<hi rend="superscript">13</hi></p> 

<p>What is notable among the
many appearances of Nelsons and Wicoms in the Essex County records is
actually what did not occur.  While the two families appear in many land
disputes, they never appear as opponents.  While one cannot assume that
both families were friends, it is safe to say that they were not
enemies.  Philip Nelson gave testimony that supported Daniel Wicom in a
1679 trial and in 1680 the two men sided together in another court
case. <hi rend="superscript">14</hi>  The connection between the Wicoms and the Nelsons as Margaret
Scott's chief accusers continued with the deposition of Philip and Sarah
Nelson who testified to the affliction of deceased Robert Shillito, who
lived in Daniel Wicom's tithing district.  Wicom would have collected
Shillito's taxes, been in contact with him, and have been very familiar
with his supposed affliction.  The final connection occurred in the
deposition of Thomas Nelson.  At the end of his testimony, the record
indicated him as a member of the grand jury giving him the power to
determine Margaret Scott's fate extending the Nelson-Wicom connection to
nearly all aspects of the trial. <hi rend="superscript">15</hi></p>

<p>The depositions offered against
Margaret Scott highlight the rumors about her reputation and the common
beliefs that circulated about witches in early New England.  Of the six
depositions presented before the Salem Court on September 15th, four
described the spectral image of Margaret Scott tormenting others.  Some
depositions given showed that many people suspected Scott was a witch
long before 1692.  The spectral evidence came from the depositions of
young women who may have been influenced by their paranoia surrounding
Indian hostilities, social pressures, and religious beliefs. </p>

<p>According
to the evidence, Margaret Scott's specter first attacked Frances Wicom
at the beginning of the trials at Salem around the tenth of June and
continued to do so until the date of her examination on August 5th.  The
seventeen year old Frances gave her deposition to the court at Salem on
September 15, 1692. Describing afflictions that were believed to be very
common Frances stated that Margaret Scott "came to me and most
grievously torment me by choacking and almost presing me to death".<hi rend="superscript">16</hi></p>

<p>Several factors may have led Frances Wicom to testify to such a terrible
experience including her home environment and its relationship with
Indian conflicts.  She undoubtedly would have heard first hand accounts
of bloody conflicts with Indians.  New evidence shows that a direct
correlation can be found between anxiety over Indian Wars being fought
in Maine and witchcraft accusations.  In such a tense environment where
New England was tormented by Satan through witches and Indians, who were
thought to be servants of the devil, young girls would have been willing
to accuse any one who was remotely suspicious making Scott, who already
had a shady reputation, an easy target.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi></p> 

<p>Frances's family's high
status in Rowley may have made also have made her a likely candidate for
being "afflicted".  The Wicoms's affluence would have made Frances the
object of attention in Rowley society.  Being afflicted gave Frances an
outlet so she could say and do anything without any consequences
providing a great release for a girl who lived in such a proper setting
as the Wicom household and Puritan society in general.<hi rend="superscript">18</hi></p> 

<p>The second
sufferer from spectral torture, Mary Daniel, also presented her
deposition at the trial in Salem on September 15.  It too listed many
painful torments at the hands of Margaret Scott.<hi rend="superscript">19</hi></p> 

<p>No records of Mary
Daniel's birth or parents exist.  The first time Mary Daniel entered the
record books was for her baptism on December 6, 1691.  She next appeared
for her accusations of Margaret Scott.  There was a good chance that
Mary Daniel was actually a servant in the household of Reverend Edward
Payson, minister of Rowley at the time of the trials. <hi rend="superscript">20</hi>  He obviously
would have encouraged her to become a member of the Puritan faith.<hi rend="superscript">21</hi></p> 

<p>If Mary Daniel worked for Mr. Payson, her religious surroundings could well
have had an effect on her actions.  Recent converts to Puritanism felt
inadequate and unworthy and at times displaced their worries through
possession.  Although Mary Daniel was never possessed, her baptism only
a few months before the Salem witch hunt presumably increased the
pressures of her religion.  These feelings would only have been
heightened if she in fact served in the household of the local
minister.<hi rend="superscript">22</hi></p> 

<p>The third piece of spectral evidence against Margaret
Scott came from another young woman, Sarah Coleman, who deposed that
Scott's specter had tortured her on August fifteenth "by pricking,
pinching, and choaking of me."  Although born in Rowley, the
twenty-two-year-old Coleman lived in neighboring Newbury with her
parents for the previous nineteen years.  The senior Colemans probably
knew of Margaret Scott's reputation for witchcraft before they moved to
Newbury; that knowledge, combined with the region-wide gossip about
Scott's more recent malefic activities, undoubtedly in 1692 led their
daughter to accuse their former townswoman.<hi rend="superscript">23</hi></p> 

<p>Two Rowley residents,
Phillip and Sarah Nelson, testified about conversations with Robert
Shilleto.  The Nelsons deposed that Shilleto believed himself a victim
of Margaret Scott's afflictions and "we have often heard him complaining
of Margaret Scott for hurting of him, and often said that she was a
witch." The Nelsons also described how his affliction lasted for two or
three years before Shilleto passed away in 1687 showing that Scott was
suspected of being a witch long before the Salem Witch Hunt
occurred.<hi rend="superscript">24</hi></p> 

<p>Spectral evidence was not the only tool that accusers used
in Margaret Scott's trial.  Two depositions presented at her September
15th appearance before the court examined how Scott tormented people
through maleficium, a witches's harming of one's property, health, or
family.  Of the depositions offered both presented examples of the
refusal guilt syndrome among the accusers.  The depositions also showed
how an ability to predict the future, and damage to livestock raised
suspicions against an individual. <hi rend="superscript">25</hi></p>

<p>The deposition presented to the
Salem court on September 15th by Daniel Wicom provided evidence of
maleficium.  His testimony described an encounter with Margaret Scott
that occurred about five or six years before the trial when he did not
give Scott corn.  He reported that Scott predicted that he would be
unable to harvest corn that evening and immediately oxen started to act
in a strange way making it unable for Wicom to harvest his fields. <hi rend="superscript">26</hi></p>

<p>Wicom's deposition provided an example of refusal guilt syndrome where
he initially denied a good to Margaret Scott only to suffer an
inconvenience directly related to what Scott was begging for.  This
testimony also provided evidence that described Scott's ability to
predict the future, which was a trait thought to be used by
witches.<hi rend="superscript">27</hi></p> 

<p>More evidence centering on maleficium came from Thomas
Nelson, whose statement was also influenced by refusal guilt syndrome. 
Nelson testified that when Margaret Scott was "Earnest she was for me to
bring her wood" and he refused to deliver it immediately one of his cows
acted in a strange way and another died.<hi rend="superscript">28</hi>  Nelson's deposition not
only describes many classic characteristics of maleficium, but also
includes information about his loss of cattle which was a symbol of
status, common in many witchcraft accusations in New England.  In
attacking his livestock Thomas Nelson believed that Margaret Scott was a
threat to his position among the other men in the town.<hi rend="superscript">29</hi> In his
deposition, Nelson testifies that after the death of his cows he "had
hard thoughts of this woman."<hi rend="superscript">30</hi></p> 

<p>Major events in Margaret Scott's case
coincided with important dates of the Salem witchcraft court.  When
compared to the testimony against Scott, clear patterns can be found
between the evidence brought against her and the timing of the Salem
court.<hi rend="superscript">31</hi></p> 

<p>Evidence from the girls' testimony was synonymous with
important events in the Salem trials.  Frances Wicom was the first girl
to experience spectral torment in 1692 "quickly after the first Court at
Salem."  Frances also testified that Scott's afflictions on her stopped
on the day of her examination, August 5.  Mary Daniel deposed on August
4 that Margaret Scott afflicted her on "ye 2d day of the week last
past," which would have coincided with Scott's arrest.  The third
afflicted girl, Sarah Coleman, testified that the specter of Margaret
Scott started to afflict her on the 15th of August, which fell ten days
after the trials of George Burroughs and Scott's own examination. 
Additionally, the 15th was only four days before the executions of
Burroughs, John Proctor, John Willard, George Jacobs, and Martha
Carrier; accused who were not "usual suspects" that brought considerable
attention to the Salem proceedings.<hi rend="superscript">32</hi></p> 

<p>Once Margaret Scott's case came
before the Salem court, the magistrates were eager to prosecute her for
witchcraft.  At the same time that Margaret Scott appeared in front of
the court, critics of the proceedings had become more vocal expressing
concern over the wide use of spectral evidence in the Salem trials.  The
court probably took the opportunity to prosecute Margaret Scott to help
its own reputation.  Margaret Scott's case not only involved spectral
evidence, but also a fair amount of maleficium evidence.  Scott
exhibited many characteristics that were believed common among witches
in New England.  Additionally, the spectral testimony given by the
afflicted girls bolstered the accusers' case.  With a combination of
solid maleficium and spectral evidence against her, the proceedings took
only one day to complete.  To the judges at Salem, Margaret Scott was
perfect candidate to highlight the court's effectiveness.  By executing
Scott, the magistrates at Salem could silence critics of the trials by
executing a "real witch" suspected of being associated with the devil
for many years.<hi rend="superscript">33</hi> </p> 

<p>Margaret Scott was executed at Salem as a result
of a suspicious reputation, the combination of spectral and maleficium
evidence against her, the close relationship among her accusers, and the
timing of her trial.  Margaret Scott's downfall resulted from a series
of misfortunes that she could not avoid.  Impoverished and isolated from
her long widowhood, Scott's shady reputation made her an easy target for
witchcraft suspicions.  Her accusers' depositions describe many typical
beliefs about witches in early New England built up over a prolonged
period of time.  Even the actions taken against her by the prominent
families of Rowley were not uncommon in New England witchcraft. 
Margaret Scott simply could not avoid the key factor in her
condemnation; her profile as a "usual suspect".  Unlike many of the
other accused before the court, Scott was faced with an equal amount of
spectral and maleficium evidence.  The proponents of the court saw the
opportunity to use Margaret Scott to their advantage.  Her case showed
the court relieving a community of a long believed witch and distracted
attention from other defendants who were convicted on much more
questionable evidence.</p>

<head>"The Geography and Genealogy of Gloucester Witchcraft"</head>
<p>Written by Jedediah Drolet (copyright, 2005)</p>
<p>History 209, An Undergraduate Course, Cornell Univeristy</p>
<p>Spring Semester, 2003</p>
<p>Revised for presentation to the Berkshire Conference, June, 2005</p>

<p>Most scholarship on the Salem Witchcraft crisis has focused on Salem
Village and to some extent on Salem Town.  This is hardly surprising, since
the crisis started in Salem Village and these two communities, along
with nearby Andover, produced the vast majority of witchcraft
accusations and trials.  However, other towns in Essex County also
experienced witchcraft allegations, some of which produced trials and
even executions.  One of these towns was Gloucester.</p>

<p>Gloucester in 1692 was still an isolated farming community, not yet the
thriving port and fishing town it would soon become.  It had survived a
series of factional conflicts earlier in the seventeenth century and
attained the kind of stable, harmonious equilibrium Puritans expected of
their communities.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>  And yet, this model New England town produced nine
witchcraft accusations during the crisis, more than any other community
except for Andover, Salem Village and Salem Town.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>  There have been
several explanations offered over the years, but none have been wholly
satisfactory.  This paper will offer a few tentative steps toward a new
answer.</p>

<p>The Gloucester residents accused of witchcraft in 1692 fall neatly into
a few discrete groups, due to the extremely scanty nature of the
surviving records.  The first group consisted of Margaret Prince and
Elizabeth Dicer, who were accused by Ebenezer Babson on behalf of his
mother, the widow Eleanor Babson, on September 3, 1692.  This same
Ebenezer Babson had been involved in the odd hysteria over phantom
Indians and French soldiers that had gripped Gloucester the preceding
summer, so there is much of interest in this case.  However, a close
look at this case would extend this paper far beyond a reasonable
length, so I will not discuss it in detail, merely noting connections
between it and the later case on which I focus.</p>

<p>The next Gloucesterwoman to be accused was Joan Penney.  She was accused
on September 13, 1692 by one Zebulon Hill, a former resident of
Gloucester who lived in Salem Town in 1692.  There are many intricacies
of this case which have already been described in some detail by Carol
Karlsen in The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, so I will not discuss this
case either.</p>

<p>Phoebe Day, Mary Rowe and Rachel Vinson were probably the next women
accused in Gloucester.  There is no record of their accusation or
examination extant, but their names were on a petition to the Governor
and Council signed by a group of prisoners held at Ipswich jail sometime
in early winter, asking to be set free on bail pending trial in the
spring.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>  Their accusation has traditionally been placed here in the
chronology, between Joan Penney and the women accused of afflicting Mary
Fitch.<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>  There is no extant contemporary evidence corroborating the
traditional account, nor is there any other evidence of these women's
cases to consider.  There are, however, certain intriguing connections
between these women and the next group, which will be explored in this
paper.</p>

<p>The last group about which there are court records consists of Esther
Elwell, Abigail Rowe and Rebecca Dike, a warrant for the arrest of whom
was issued on November 3, 1692 on account of accusations that they had
afflicted one Mary Fitch made by her brother, nephew and son.  This
paper will focus on these women, their accusers, and the possible
connections between them and the previously mentioned group of women in
Ipswich jail.</p>

<p>Unlike the other cases involving Gloucester residents, the accusation of
these three women followed a pattern unique to the events of 1692.  In
late October or early November Lieutenant James Stevens, a
highly-regarded member of the Gloucester community, sent for the
"afflicted girls" of Salem Village to find the culprit responsible for
the bewitching of his sister Mrs. Mary Fitch, much as Joseph Ballard had
done in Andover in July.  The girls named Rebecca Dike, Esther Elwell
and Abigail Rowe as the witches, and Stevens, his son William, and Mrs.
Fitch's son Nathaniel Coit subsequently filed a complaint with the
magistrates.  A warrant for the three, the last arrest of the crisis,
was issued November 5.<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> </p>

<p>Among the little surviving evidence in this case is the testimony of
Mrs. Fitch's brother James Stevens about his sister feeling a woman
sitting on her when he saw nothing, dated November 8.<hi rend="superscript">6</hi>  There is also a
deposition of Betty Hubbard, one of the "afflicted girls" of Salem
Village, against the three women with the same date.<hi rend="superscript">7</hi>  These scraps tell
little about the subsequent experience of the three suspected witches,
but it seems they were probably not indicted, since they would have been
tried under the new courts convened in 1693 to replace the dissolved
Court of Oyer and Terminer and there would be some record of their
trials.</p>

<p>This James Stevens was an important figure in town.  He was a deacon of
the church and a lieutenant in the militia.  His father William Stevens
had been one of the early settlers of Gloucester and was a noted
shipbuilder.  James may have followed in the trade.  He married Susannah
Eveleth, daughter of Sylvester Eveleth, in 1656 and in 1658 received a
grant from the town of land on Town Neck, near Trynall Cove.  It is
possible that he lived there, but there is no solid information on his
place of residence.  Eight of his eleven children were still living at
the time of his death in 1697: William (who is also listed on the
witchcraft accusation), Samuel, Ebenezer, David, Jonathan, Mary and
Hannah.<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>  He probably inherited all of Eastern Point below the Great
Pond from his father, who was apparently granted it by the town, since
it was in the possession of his son Samuel Stevens in 1697.<hi rend="superscript">9</hi>  At his
death in 1697 his estate totaled £239 19s.<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> </p>

<p>Mary Stevens, the daughter of William and sister of James, married John
Coit in 1652 and had five children, one of whom, Nathaniel, is listed on
the witchcraft complaint.  She married John Fitch in 1667, after her
husband's death.  While John Coit was alive, the couple lived on the
Neck of Houselots; the location of John Fitch's residence is
frustratingly difficult to determine from the brief notices in the
records.  He received a grant at Kettle Cove in 1680 for his service in
King Philip's War; there is no indication that he lived there, but even
if he did he must have lived somewhere else prior to that.<hi rend="superscript">11</hi>  These
people were all of relatively high status in the town, as indicated by
the offices they held and the titles used to refer to them (particularly
"Mistress" used of Mary Fitch).  Mary Fitch's sickness in November 1692,
leading to her death, was the trigger for the accusation of witchcraft
under discussion. </p>

<p>Esther<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> Dutch, the daughter of Osman and Grace Dutch, was born around
1639 and married Samuel Elwell in 1658.  Her parents lived at the Harbor
at a place known as Dutch's Slough and were rather prominent in town
affairs.<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>  Samuel Elwell's father Robert was also a distinguished
citizen of the town.  He lived at the Harbor at first, but most of his
land was on Eastern Point, and he probably ended up living there.<hi rend="superscript">14</hi> 
Samuel inherited his house and most of his land when he died in 1683. 
Prior to that Samuel had lived across the Harbor, near the Cut, in a
house belonging to Robert that went to Samuel's son Samuel when Samuel
(senior) inherited his father's house.  The value of Robert Elwell's
estate totaled £290 10s.<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> </p>

<p>Rebecca Dolliver was born around 1640, the daughter of Samuel Dolliver,
who lived at Freshwater Cove.  She married Richard Dike, who was about
the same age, in 1667.  They lived at Little River, where Richard had
inherited land from his grandfather Walter Tybbot.  Over the years his
landholdings steadily grew through grants from the town and purchases
from neighbors such as Joseph Eveleth, from whom he bought 13 acres in
1669.<hi rend="superscript">16</hi>  This Joseph Eveleth was the son of Sylvester Eveleth and the
brother of James Stevens's wife Susannah.<hi rend="superscript">17</hi> </p>

<p>Abigail Rowe was born in 1677 to Hugh and Mary Prince Rowe, who lived at
Little Good Harbor and had large amounts of land there.  The fact that
she was only fifteen years old in 1692 shows immediately that there is
more to this case than meets the eye.  While it was certainly not
unheard of for children to be accused of witchcraft, especially in the
Salem hysteria, they were generally accused along with other family
members as part of the cascade of accusations that swept through towns
like Andover.  Seeing a teenaged girl accused along with two adult
women, neither of them close relatives, is quite unusual.</p>

<p>As it happens, Abigail Rowe was not, in fact, the only woman in her
family accused of witchcraft, just the only one listed in this
accusation.  Her mother was one of the three women listed in the
petition from Ipswich jail (as "the wife of Hugh Roe of Cape Anne"),<hi rend="superscript">18</hi>
and her grandmother was the aforementioned Margaret Prince, accused
early on by Ebenezer Babson and also listed in the Ipswich petition. 
This is a strong indication of a link among these three accusations, as
well as a clue to the date of accusation of the three women listed only
in the petition; it would be unlikely for the daughter to be accused
before her mother and grandmother, especially since she is not even
listed in the petition herself.  The link becomes stronger when the
connections between the Rowe family and the Day and Vinson families are
examined.</p>

<p>Hugh Rowe and his older brother John, along with their mother, received
equal portions of their father John's estate of £205 16s. 10d. upon his
death in 1662.<hi rend="superscript">19</hi>  Hugh received the land further from the house, toward
Starknought Harbor, while John received the land closer to the house and
their mother Brigit got the land in between.  Hugh was also to share the
east end of the house with his mother, and receive it for himself upon
her death.20  Five years later Hugh and John entered into an agreement
witnessed by Robert Elwell, who must have been a figure of mutual trust
to John and Hugh.<hi rend="superscript">21</hi>  Another witness to a transaction of Hugh Rowe was
Clement Coldum, who witnessed a sale of one-third of his property to
James Gardner in 1668.  In exchange for this land, Hugh received from
Gardner his house and nine acres scattered around the Little Good
Harbor/Eastern Point area, along with various other possessions. 
Gardner's land adjoined Hugh's, according to boundary landmarks
mentioned in various land grants, including one from 1683 extending his
land from the corner of Robert Elwell's marsh to the road to the Cape. 
So Elwell was also a neighbor.<hi rend="superscript">22</hi> </p>

<p>As for Coldum, he would later resurface in 1692 to give a deposition
against Betty Hubbard, the seventeen-year-old girl who deposed against
Esther Elwell, Rebecca Dike and Abigail Rowe, saying that when he was
taking her home from meeting on May 29 she asked him to go faster
because "she said the woods were full of Devils, &amp; said ther &amp; there
they be, but I could se none."  After he obediently sped up, she told
him they had passed the devils and he could slow down.  He then asked
her if she was afraid of the Devil, and she said no, that "she could
discourse with the Devil as well as with me."<hi rend="superscript">23</hi>  This raises the obvious
question of what Coldum, who lived in either Gloucester or Lynn at the
time, was doing in Salem in May of 1692, and why he was taking Betty
Hubbard home, presumably to the house of William Griggs, where she was a
servant.  The most obvious answer is that he had been summoned for the
grand jury for the Court of Oyer and Terminer established on May 27.  No
records of the names of jurymen survive, so there is no way to firmly
establish if Coldum was one of them, but he had served on many juries
for the Essex County Quarterly Courts, so it is entirely reasonable to
suppose that he may have been summoned for this one.<hi rend="superscript">24</hi> </p>

<p>Betty Hubbard also had Gloucester connections; her master William Griggs
lived there for several years and after the trials she herself settled
down there and married.  The influence her Gloucester connections may
have had on her role in the accusations of Gloucester residents is still
obscure but a ripe area for future study.</p>

<p>In 1685, Hugh Rowe received three parcels of land from his
"father-in-law" William Vinson.<hi rend="superscript">25</hi>  Hugh's wife at the time was Mary, the
daughter of Thomas and Margaret Prince, whom he had married in 1674.<hi rend="superscript">26</hi> 
However, he had married her six months after the death of his first
wife, one Rachel Langton, whom he had married in 1667 and who had borne
him three daughters.<hi rend="superscript">27</hi>  She was likely a widowed daughter of William
Vinson by his first wife, Sarah, who had been accused of witchcraft in
1653.  Even after her death, her father apparently continued to consider
her widower his son-in-law.<hi rend="superscript">28</hi> </p>

<p>Thus Hugh and Mary Rowe lived near Robert Elwell, whose daughter-in-law
was accused, and had a close relationship to William Vinson, whose wife
was accused.  Mary, who was accused herself, was also the daughter of
Margaret Prince, who was accused.  Thomas and Margaret Prince lived at
the harbor, but they owned land all over, including Little River and
Little Good Harbor. </p>

<p>The Rowes also had strong ties to the Day family.  Hugh and Rachel
Rowe's daughters Mary, Ruth and Rachel married, respectively, Ezekiel,
Nathaniel and Samuel Day, sons of Anthony Day.  These marriages took
place between 1690 and 1692.29  Another of Anthony Day's sons, Timothy,
married Phoebe Wilds in 1679.  She was one of the women mentioned in the
Ipswich petition.<hi rend="superscript">30</hi> </p>

<p>All of the Gloucesterwomen whose accusations are only known from the
Ipswich petition were connected to the Rowe family.  This provides clear
evidence that there was a connection between their accusations and the
accusation of November 3 against Esther Elwell, Rebecca Dike and Abigail
Rowe.  The fact that none of these women were listed in the petition,
moreover, suggests that it was made before they were accused or at least
before they had been put in jail.  The petition is undated but mentions
winter being "soe far come on that it can not be exspected that we
should be tryed during this winter season," which could be reconciled
with an autumn date.</p>

<p>A possible series of events, then, is as follows: the hysteria over
spectral French soldiers and Indians during the summer, initiated by
Ebenezer Babson, then in September the accusation of Margaret Prince and
Elizabeth Dicer by Babson, based on complaints by his mother.  Next, at
some point in September or October, Rachel Vinson, Phoebe Day and Mary
Rowe were accused, either together or separately, by someone in
Gloucester, probably influenced by the torrents of accusations emerging
in other Essex County towns.  Since Margaret Prince had already been
accused, it is likely that her daughter Mary Rowe was the focus of
whatever accusation was made, and the other two were brought into it
because of their connections to the Rowe family.  The illness of someone
in town could have been the catalyst for this accusation.</p>

<p>After that, Mary Fitch became ill.  With hysteria over witchcraft
growing, her family looked around for witches to blame, even sending for
some of the Salem Village girls to uncover the culprits.  The people
they came up with, whether on their own or with the help of the
afflicted girls, were tangentially connected to the women already in
jail.  Thus the accusation, listing three women not particularly
connected to one another but part of the large social group that already
had several more prominent members accused.  However, by this time the
trials were winding down and none of the accused women from Gloucester
were tried.</p>

<p>This scenario fits with several pieces of evidence: the women accused
early on, such as Margaret Prince and Elizabeth Dicer, were notorious
for various reasons and thus more likely to arouse suspicions.  Prince
had a sharp tongue, and Dicer was once fined for calling Mrs.
Hollingsworth of Salem a witch.  The women in the Ipswich petition were
somewhat less notorious, but had had their problems: Phoebe Day, whose
maiden name was Wilds, was related to Sarah Wilds of Topsfield, who was
hanged for witchcraft on July 19, 1692,<hi rend="superscript">31</hi> Mary Rowe was Margaret
Prince's daughter, and Rachel Vinson was the widow of William Vinson,
whose first wife had once been accused of witchcraft.<hi rend="superscript">32</hi>  The last group
of accused women was even more distant from past suspicions: Abigail
Rowe was probably accused because her mother and grandmother already had
been, Esther Elwell's mother Ruth Dutch had been accused of witchcraft
together with William Vinson's first wife, and Rebecca Dike seems to
have had no clear connection to past suspicions at all, at least from
extant records, but she lived near the Eveleths, in-laws of the
Stevenses, who may have had their problems with her.</p>

<p>One final note about these accusations is that all the people involved
were of high social and economic status.  The Gloucester accusations
involved no singling out of poor, marginal women, as was often true of
witchcraft accusations (in Salem Village, for example).  All of the
estates of these families that were recorded were valued at more than
200 pounds.  Furthermore, this is true of both the accusers and the
victims.  They all had comparatively large holdings of land and held
many town offices.  From a comparative perspective, this is perhaps the
most striking aspect of the Gloucester accusations.  The cases seem to
have been based on fear and suspicion among the upper class against a
backdrop of paranoia throughout the county.</p>

after about 1675 the name is associated with Lynn rather than
Gloucester, and someone by that name apparently served as constable
of Lynn for many years.  I am not certain whether this is the same
person or not, but I am assuming that the Clement Coldum who
deposed against Betty Hubbard is the same one who is associated
with Gloucester, whether or not he actually lived there in 1692. 
In any case, the ages given in the court records are consistent
with this being the same man. </p>
