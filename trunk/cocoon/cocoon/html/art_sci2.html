21st century</h2>
<h2>By Jon Bowen, A&amp;S Online, September 2003</h2>
<div align="left">
<p>IATH began in 1992 with a grant from IBM and a multi-year
commitment of support from the University. The Institute -- which
celebrates its 10 th anniversary in September with a scholarly
symposium that will be open to the public -- now draws support from
multiple corporations, foundations and individuals who contribute
to projects.</p>
<p>The result is a multi-disciplinary forum that carries Thomas
Jefferson's educational ideals into the Digital Age. Researchers in
the arts and humanities are able to take advantage of sophisticated
technical support and advanced computer technology to collaborate
on projects that push the frontiers of scholarship.</p>
<p>Every year, the Institute awards one or more two-year
fellowships. The fellowships are open to U.Va. professors as well
as others in the academic community. Once fellows come on board
with IATH, they have ready access to the staff of programmers, web
designers and IT specialists on the Institute's staff.</p>
<p>One of IATH's newest additions is Stephen E. Plog, Commonwealth
Professor of Anthropology at U.Va., who joins the Institute's
roster of fellows this fall. With support from the Mellon
Foundation, Plog will be collaborating with colleagues around the
country on the creation of the <a href=
"http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/chaco/" target=
"_blank">Chaco Digital Research Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Chaco Canyon, in northwestern New Mexico, was home to
prehistoric Pueblo Indians from A.D. 850 to 1150. &nbsp; The new
archive will be built upon a relational database of architectural
data from Chaco, complete with notes and drawings from field work
in the region.</p>
<p>Chaco Canyon, in northwestern New Mexico, was home to
prehistoric Pueblo Indians from A.D. 850 to 1150. &nbsp; The new
archive will be built upon a relational database of architectural
data from Chaco, complete with notes and drawings from field work
in the region.</p>
<p>"The latter issue is particularly critical," Plog said, "because
the Chaco data we'll be working with are now stored at several
different institutions scattered around the country. A scholar
interested in working with these data is faced with the expense of
traveling to multiple locations.&nbsp;The archive will hopefully
allow interested scholars to sit at their computers and work with
all of the data, now linked electronically in a way that allows
quick searches and queries."</p>
<p>But that's not all. Work on the Chaco archive could become a
model for archaeological scholarship in the 21 st century.</p>
<p>"If we can generalize these archive models," Plog said, "we can
transform the way that all archaeological data are collected and
stored. This in turn could revolutionize the discipline by allowing
tremendous increases in the types of information available and in
the ease of examining relations among types of data through the use
of relational databases."</p>
<p>Plog and his colleagues working on the Chaco project have a
vision for the new archive, but they'll rely on IATH's technical
experts to make their vision a reality.</p>
<p>"The group of archaeologists working on the project has the
expertise to conceptualize what the archive &nbsp; should be," Plog
said. "But we lack the knowledge and skills to move from that
conceptualization.&nbsp;Our collaboration with the outstanding
group at IATH will allow us to integrate the archaeological model
with a digital conceptualization to develop the structure of the
archive."</p>
