<p><b>10.</b> Much confusion and inaccurate attribution has
occurred in confusing Bridget Bishop with Sarah Bishop. In an entry
from SWP, I, 95-97, Sarah Bishop is incorrectly identified as
Bridget Bishop. For clarification of this complex identification
problem, see David L. Greene, "Salem Witches I: Bridget Bishop,"
American Genealogist, vol. 57, no. 3 (July 1981), pp. 129-138. See
also by Greene corrections to this essay, "Bridget Bishop
Correction," American Genealogist, vol. 58, no. 3 (July 1982), p.
163. The incorrect entry, which should indicate Sarah rather than
Bridget Bishop appears as follows:</p>
<p><b>(The Rev. John Hale et al. v. Bridget Bishop)</b></p>
<p>John Hale of Beverly aged about 56 yeares [torn] &amp; saith
that about 5 or 6 years ago e Christian the wife of John Trask
(living in Salem bounds bordering on the abovesaid Beverly) beeing
in full comunion in o'r Church came to me to [de] sier that
Goodwife Bishop her Neighb'r wife of Edw: Bishop Jun'r might not be
permitted to receive the Lords Supper in our church till she had
given her the said Trask satisfaction for some offences that were
against her.viz because the said Bishop did entertaine people in
her house at unseason-able houres in the night to keep drinking and
playing at shovel-board whereby discord did arise in other families
&amp; young people were in danger to bee corrupted &amp; that the
s'd Trask knew these things &amp; had once gon into the house &amp;
fynding some at shovel-board had taken the peices thay played with
&amp; thrown them into the fyre &amp; had reprooved the said Bishop
for promoting such disorders, But received no satisfaction from her
about it.</p>
<p>I gave s'd Christian Trask direction how to proceed farther in
this matter if it were clearly prooved And indeed by the
information I have had otherwise I doe fear that if a stop had not
been putt to those disorders s'd Edw. Bishop's house would have
been a house of great prophainness &amp; iniquity.</p>
<p>But as to Christian Trask the next news I heard of her was that
she was distracted &amp; asking her husband Trask when she was so
taken [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee
[came from] my house when shee complained against Goody Bishop.
<b>[continued on page 96]</b></p>
<p>She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by
fasting &amp; prayer &amp; the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd
[Trask] to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in
[her] distraction (&amp; took it then to bee only distraction, yet
fearing sometimes somw't worse) but since I have seen the fitts of
those bewitched at Salem Village I call to mind some of hers to be
much like some of theirs.</p>
<p>The said Trask when recovered as I understood it did manifest
strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd Bishop's
wife &amp; showed so much aversness from having any conversation
that I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd Goody Bishop
at that time for wee have since [torn] At length s'd Christian
Trask [was] agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the
forenoon at the publ [i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance &amp;
so continued sometimes better sometimes worse unto her death,
manifesting that shee under temptation to kill her selfe or
somebody else.</p>
<p>I enquired of Marg'rt Ring who kept at or nigh the house, what
shee had observed of s'd Trask before this last distraction shee
told [mee.] Goody Trask was much given to reading &amp; search the
pro-phecys of scrip[ture].</p>
<p>The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house
she[e] came home &amp; said shee had been w'th Goody Bishop &amp;
that they two were now friend or to that effect.</p>
<p>I was oft praying w'th &amp; councelling of Goody Trask before
her death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed
more rationall &amp; earnestly desired Edw: Bishop might be sent
for that shee might make friends with him, I asked her if shee had
wronged Edw. Bishop shee said not that shee knew of unless it were
in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th
them &amp; throwing them into the fyre &amp; if she did evill in it
she was very sorry for it &amp; desiered he would be friends with
her or forgive her. this was the very day before she dyed, or a few
days before. Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a
month and in those intervalls wherein shee was better shee
earnestly desired prayers &amp; the Sabboth befere she dyed I
received a note for prayers on her behalf w'ch her husband said was
written by her selfe &amp; I judge was her owne hand writing beeing
well acquainted with her hand.</p>
<p>As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice of
her wind pipe cutt out. &amp; another wound above that threww the
<b>[continued on page 97]</b></p>
<p>windpipe &amp; Gullet &amp; the veine they call jugular. So that
I then judge &amp; still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th
so short a pair of cissars to mangle her selfe so without some
extraordinary work of the devill or witchcraft</p>

<td><b>11.</b> In SWP, I, 52 the narrative of John Alden is
identified as by John Alden. The same attribution is made by George
Lincoln Burr in Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases 1648-1706.
However, the author is uncertain. The narrative is written about
Alden in the third person, and no surviving evidence suggests that
he wrote it. It was possibly written by Robert Calef.</td>

13.</b>On page 61 of Salem Story the age of Richard Carrier is
given as 28, based on the transcription in Boyer and Nissenbaum,
Salem Witchcraft Papers, Vol. 2, p. 526. Based on the research of
Pamela Worden, this age is in error and that Carrier was 18. The
transcription in Boyer and Nissenbaum's edition is incorrect.
Richard Carrier was 18.</p>
