21st century</h2>
<h2>By Jon Bowen, A&amp;S Online, September 2003</h2>

<p>Ray describes the collaboration between IATH fellows and staff
in similar terms. "Most IATH projects start out with a modest
vision on the part of a fellow," he said. But once a fellow joins
the Institute's team, he or she begins having weekly meetings with
IATH staff to hash out development and design. That's where the
envelope gets pushed. "We talk about expanding beyond the way you
might've originally conceived it. They say, 'What other things
would you like to do?' Each fellow is expert in the scholarship,
but transformation into the digital environment calls for new
thinking."</p>
<p>New thinking will be the theme of the day at <a href=
"http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/anniversary/">IATH's 10th
Anniversary Symposium</a> , taking place in the South Meeting Room
of Newcomb Hall, September 25-26. The symposium, which is open to
the public, will include presentations by noted IATH fellows such
as Ayers and McGann, as well as John Unsworth, the founding
director of IATH.</p>
<p>The symposium will evaluate the Institute's past work and also
chart a course for humanities computing at U.Va. in the years
ahead. The outcome of the symposium will be a blueprint for IATH's
future.</p>
<p>IATH's presence at U.Va. is already driving a new focus on
digital work in the humanities at the University. One sign of this
focus is the creation of a new MA program in digital humanities,
which will be offered beginning in Fall 2004.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IATH's fellows and staff, working in their quarters
in the west wing of Alderman Library, go on building a digital
storehouse of data that spans the breadth of the humanities. Given
the boundless limits of the Web, one of the prime quandaries for
IATH fellows is knowing when a project is actually done.</p>
<p>"That's a problem with IATH projects -- they're so open-ended,"
Ray said with a laugh. As for his Salem Witch Trials archive, he
plans to continue his work until the time comes for younger minds
to take the controls. "There are other scholars in other
institutions who could take it over. I'll turn it over
someday."</p>
