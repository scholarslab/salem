Born in Falmouth, Maine in 1675, Mercy Lewis lost both her parents
to Indian attacks and became an orphan at a young age. Dislocated
from her family, like many of the accusing girls in Salem Village,
she resided first with Reverend George Burroughs as a servant and
then later with the family of Thomas Putnam to whom she was
distantly related. As a friend of Ann Putnam and the other girls
involved in the witchcraft accusations, Mercy herself became one of
the most consistent and vocal accusers during the 1692 witchcraft
trials in Salem.<br />
