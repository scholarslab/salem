Samuel Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643 to a modest Quaker family
in Boston. He studied carpentry and moved to Andover, Massachusetts
in 1672 to find work. There he married his second wife, Sarah
Hawkes, a wealthy widow with whom he had seven children. In 1692,
he was accused of witchcraft and brought to trial in Salem. The
fact he was found guilty is not surprising, as he had dabbled in
fortune telling as a young man, had family members who were
disliked in Andover, and had married a woman whom many did not
think he was worthy of marrying. During his court examination, he
confessed to being a witch by submitting a long and detailed story
of his indiscretions in order to save his life. His conscience and
personal courage led him to recant the story and claim innocence,
knowing the risk involved. He was hanged on September 22,
1692.<br />
