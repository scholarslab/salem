<h2><font color="#990000">Sarah Osborne</font></h2>
<p align="left">In February of 1692, Sarah Osborne became one of
the first three victims to be accused of witchcraft in Salem
Village. As the widow of Robert Prince-a Salem Villager who
purchased a 150-acre farm next to his friend Captain John Putnam's,
Osborne was required (by Prince's will) to carry-over their estate
to their two young sons. However, by attempting to overtake
possession of the property for herself and her new husband, Irish
immigrant Alexander Osborne, Sarah Osborne upset social norms that
consequently resulted in accusations of witchcraft by the Putnam
family. She died in prison on May 10, 1692.</p>
