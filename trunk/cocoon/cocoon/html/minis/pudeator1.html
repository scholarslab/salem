<h2><font color="#990000">Ann Pudeator</font></h2>
<p align="left">Executed on Sept. 22, 1692, the widow Ann Greenslit
Pudeator was one of the seven unfortunate victims of the final
hanging on Gallows Hill during the Salem witch trials. Highlights
from her trial included the usual testimony of the circle of
accusing girls that Ann had afflicted them in "spectral" form. John
Best, Sr. also accused Ann of having murdered his wife, whom Ann
had served as a nurse. Mary Warren went to the extreme of
implicating Pudeator in the deaths of four people. Historian Carol
Karlsen speculates that Pudeator may have been targeted due to her
profession as a midwife that placed her in direct competition with
male care providers, as well as her defiance of the Puritan female
gender ideal of meekness and submission to male authority. Although
the details of Ann Pudeator's birth are unknown, it is estimated
that she was between 70 and 75 when she was hanged, still
protesting her innocence at the hands of false accusations.</p>
