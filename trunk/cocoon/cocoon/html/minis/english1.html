<p align="left">Philip English, the most successful merchant in
Salem Town, emigrated from Isle of Jersey as Philippe D'Anglois in
1670. He rose out of obscurity to become the largest entrepreneur
and ship owner in Salem, and he married into an established Salem
merchant family. He and his wife were arrested of witchcraft in
late April 1692, but both escaped to New York for the duration of
the trials. No attempts were made to bring English back to face
trial. During his hiding in New York, English's wealthy estate was
pillaged at the hands of Sheriff Corwin, and little restitution was
ever made for his losses.<br />
