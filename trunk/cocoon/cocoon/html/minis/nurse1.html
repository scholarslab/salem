Rebecca Nurse was an elderly and respected member of the Salem
Village community. She was accused of witchcraft by several of the
"afflicted" girls in the Village in March of 1692. Although a large
number of friends, neighbors and family members wrote petitions
testifying to her innocence, she was tried for acts of witchcraft
in June, 1692. The jury first returned a "not guilty" verdict, but
was told to reconsider, and then brought in a verdict of "guilty."
Governor Phips pardoned her, but was later persuaded to reverse his
decision by several men from Salem. She was excommunicated from the
Salem church and hanged on July 19, 1692. Her house in Danvers, the
former Salem village, still stands and is open to visitors. A large
monument also marks her grave in the Nurse family cemetery on the
grounds.<br />
