<p align="left">Bridget Bishop was the first person to be executed
during the Salem witchcraft trials. In Salem folklore, she is
portrayed as a feisty, fun-loving, lusty, innkeeper who can't seem
to keep herself out of trouble. Recently, historians have painted a
somewhat different picture, owing to the confusion with Sarah
Bishop who also appears in the court records of the witch trials.
Indisputably, the Bridget Bishop who was tried and hanged possessed
a quick wit and independent spirit that could not be crushed by the
court of Oyer and Terminer.</p>
