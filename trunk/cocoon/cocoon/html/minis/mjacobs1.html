Although she was only seventeen at the time of the Salem Witch
Trials, Margaret Jacobs knew that the safest way out of the
witchcraft accusations directed at her was through confession. She
employed this equation in her initial accusations against former
minister of Salem Village, George Burroughs, and the patriarch of
the Jacobs family, her own grandfather, George Jacobs, Sr. Although
her accusations, among others, led to the execution of both men, it
is not her accusations that make her case of interest. It is her
eventual retraction of these accusations and voicing of her own
conscience that make Jacobs an icon of strength and integrity.
While other accusers escaped death by relentlessly accusing one
person after another, Margaret Jacobs sat in jail facing death for
her refusal to stand by her initial accusations and confession of
witchcraft.<br />
