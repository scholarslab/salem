<h2><font color="#990000">Cotton Mather</font></h2>
<p align="left">Cotton Mather, one of the most famous (and
infamous) figures in the history of Puritan New England, was a
complex man of great influence upon American history and the
discourse that accompanied the Salem witch trials in the years
following 1692. As a prominent Bostonian minister, author, and born
on Feb. 12th 1663 as the son of the Harvard president Increase
Mather, Cotton's reputation as a stalwart believer in the direct
influence of the devil upon the physical world through the
spiritual realm was already in place by the start of the witch
trials. Consulted by three of the five judges, and friends with all
of the major authorities involved, Cotton's self-contradicting
positions on the use of spectral evidence and the prosecution of
the Salem witches heavily swayed the directions of the trial
proceedings and the executions. Cotton was also appointed as the
somewhat reluctant first historian of the trials, through the
commissioning of his book, The Wonders of the Invisible World, that
served to justify the trials to the higher powers in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was for this book that Cotton found
himself spit upon in the streets (and some annals of history) to
the day of his death on Feb. 13th 1728.</p>
