<p align="left">Ann Putnam, Jr., Marcy Lewis, Abigail Williams,
Mary Walcott and Elizabeth Hubbard accused Giles Corey of
witchcraft in April of 1692. He pleaded "not guilty" but refused to
be tried by the court which, in his view, had already determined
his guilt, so he stood mute rather "putting himself on the
country." He was sentenced to <i>peine forte et dure,</i> even
though it was an illegal punishment, and ended up being torturously
crushed to death on (or before) September 18, 1692. One of the
major factors which made Giles Corey a prime target was not only
his relationship with the rest of the community but also his past
encounters with the law, including a prior conviction for murder.
His chosen means of resistance and dramatic death reveal a strength
of character that playwrights, from Longfellow to Arthur Miller,
have found irresistible.<br /></p>
