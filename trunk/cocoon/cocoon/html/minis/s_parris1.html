<h2><font color="#990000">Rev. Samuel Parris</font></h2>
<p align="left">Samuel Parris was born in London in 1654. In 1680,
Parris returned from Barbados to Boston and worked as a merchant
until taking up the position of minister in the conflict ridden
Salem Village. Parris became involved in the Salem Witchcraft
Trials because of two children in his family and his own
overbearing attempts to control the members of his church. From his
pulpit he preached about the Devil and the threats on the village
from the Devil's presence. Within his family, his daughter and
live-in niece were among the first to become saccusers. Parris
himself appears in over 22 court documents, both as a court
recorder and an accusing voice. He interpreted opposition to his
sermons and efforts at control as the Devil's work. He finally fell
to the pressures of his opponents in the village and left the
pulpit in 1696. He then went on to hold various occupations,
including that of a minister, teacher, land retailer in several
different communities. He died in Sudbury in 1720.</p>
