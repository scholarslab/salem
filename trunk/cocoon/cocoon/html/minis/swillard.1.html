Samuel Willard played an important role in the halting of the Salem
witch trials. Born in 1640 to a privileged family, Willard had a
long simmering devotion to the Puritan church, a devotion he would
later cultivate at Harvard College. Despite his religious fervor,
Willard appears to be man of uncommon calm, as he urged caution in
the accusing and trying of witches. Willard also denounced spectral
evidence, claiming that the devil could impersonate even the
innocent by appearing in their shape. After the trials ended,
Willard was to push hard for reconciliation between the pro-Parris
and anti-Parris factions of Salem Village.<br />
