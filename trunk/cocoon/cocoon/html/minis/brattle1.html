<p align="left">Thomas Brattle (1658 - 1713) was a well-educated
and prosperous Boston merchant who served as treasurer of Harvard
College, and was a member of the intellectually elite Royal
Society. In early October 1692 he wrote a letter to an English
clergyman which was critical of the Salem witch trials. The letter
was circulated widely in Boston at the time, and it continues to be
studied for its reasoned attack on the witchcraft trials in Salem.
Brattle presents a compelling argument against the legal premises
and procedures involved in the afflictions, accusations, and
executions, with a particular focus on the validity of spectral
evidence in proceedings. He was careful not to argue against the
motives of the "Salem Gentlemen" as he calls the judges and
ministers at the helm, but rather against the methods they
employed. He concludes by saying "I am afraid that ages will not
wear off that reproach and those stains which these things will
leave behind them upon out land."</p>
