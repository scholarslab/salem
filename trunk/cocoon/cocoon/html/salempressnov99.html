From

Professor Bernard Rosenthal

Department of English

University of Binghamton

October 29, 1999




A new edition of legal documents pertaining to the Salem witch trials
is under preparation, to be published by Cambridge University Press.
The project, under the general editorship of Bernard Rosenthal,
professor of English at Binghamton University, will include new
transcriptions of all known, surviving legal documents related to the
trials.


The most recent attempt to transcribe all the documents occurred in the
1930's as part of a WPA project. This transcription, which existed in
typescript, was subsequently published in 1977 along with some newly
transcribed documents that had subsequently appeared.  A variety of
transcription errors appear in the WPA document, and the editors of the
new edition will seek to remedy those mistakes repeated in the 1977
edition. Additionally, previously unknown or overlooked witchcraft
documents adding significantly to the body of knowledge of the events
have recently been uncovered. Richard B. Trask, Danvers, Massachusetts
Town Archivist and an associate editor of the new edition, discovered
nineteen witchcraft related examinations, indictments, and depositions
including the examination of Giles Cory, being the only record of his
words to the court in 1692, and six documents relating to Margaret Scot
who was executed in 1692.  These nineteen documents can be found in
Trask's book, _The Devil Hath Been Raised_ (Yeoman Press, 1997) and
will be included in the Cambridge edition.


Additionally, newly discovered documents have appeared. In 1993,
Rosenthal, in his book Salem Story, published a letter from Governor
Phips to Sheriff George Corwin.  This letter had been found in the
American Antiquarian Society manuscript collection and addressed
illegal property seizure by Corwin in 1692. Since then further new,
unpublished documents, have recently been discovered by two scholars,
Mary Beth Norton, M.D. Alger Professor of American History at Cornell
University, and Benjamin Caleb Ray, NEH Distinguished Teaching
Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia.  Norton
is working on a new book on the Salem witch trials to be published by
Alfred A. Knopf.  Ray has established a Salem witch trials documents
web site at Virginia and is engaged in research to expand scholarly
information on the subject to the general public as well as to the
scholarly community <<http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft>. 


Norton found four previously unknown manuscripts in the Massachusetts
Historical Society.  The first is a November 8, 1692 deposition by one
of the so-called afflicted girls, Elizabeth Hubbard, in which she
accuses Abigail Row, Ester Elwell, and Rebecca Dike of witchcraft;
other documents include a request for jail fees in 1693, including
payment for keeping in jail the Reverend Samuel Parris's slave, Tituba;
the examination on August 13, 1692 of Daniel Eames; and a record of
grand jury action against Eames. Of particular historical significance
is that until Norton's discovery nobody had been aware that Eames had
been arrested and charged. Additionally, in recovering the Hubbard
manuscript, Norton makes the discovery that, contrary to generally
accepted beliefs by historians, new witchcraft charges were being made
after the last executions on September 22, 1692.  This document is the
last recorded formal accusation of the trials. That a charge of
witchcraft came from Hubbard may also be revealing in view of her close
connection to Dr. Griggs with whom she lived.  Hubbard is generally
assumed to be the grand niece of Griggs, and Griggs was the man
believed to have made the original diagnosis of witchcraft that helped
set in motion the Salem witch trials.


Ray's discoveries were at the Boston Public Library where he located
the examination of Ann Dolliver on June 6, 1692 for witchcraft; the
examination on the same day of Mary Ireson for witchcraft; and an
undated indictment of Ann Foster for witchcraft against Elizabeth
Hubbard.  The discovery of the examinations of Ann Dolliver and Mary
Ireson is particularly valuable in filling in critical information
about the cases involving these two women just prior to the first
execution in the Salem witch trials.  These examinations contain a
significant amount of dialogue between the accusers, the accused, and
the judges concerning witchcraft activities, seeing specters, and the
devil.  Both accused women defend themselves with vigor and cleverness.
 Mary Ireson denies that her "bad temper" means that she is a witch. 
Near the end of the examination, her uncle calls out for her to confess
and "breake ye snare of ye devill."  Ireson refuses to do so until she
has "more light" on the matter.  Ann Dolliver says that she knows the
difference between seeing a "Negro" and the spirit of the devil,
commonly believed to look like a "black man," implying that her
accusers do not, and she denies ever seeing the devil.  She also admits
to making wax "puppets" to use against her enemies who have made her
sick, a frequently believed in magical technique, and she denies that
using such magic makes her a witch.


Subject to appropriate permissions, these new documents, along with the
rediscovered nineteenth-century ones, will be published in the new
edition.
