WITCHCRAFT DELUSION</font></a></center>
<p>The first European settlement in present-day Danvers,
Massachusetts, was called Salem Village. This village was
established in the late 1630s when a group of farmers moved 5 miles
from Salem Town to the area now known as "Danvers Highlands." The
inhabitants remained legally part of Salem, though from the 1660s
they began petitioning for independence. By 1672 Salem Village
became a separate parish at which time they built a meeting house
and hired their own minister. In 1689 the village established a
covenant church with Rev. Samuel Parris as their new minister.</p>
<p>In early 1692, Rev. Parris's 9-year-old daughter Elizabeth,
12-year-old niece Abigail Williams, as well as other neighborhood
girls began to fall into horrid fits. Their parents tried to
discover what was causing their distress, and village doctor
William Griggs gave his opinion that the girls were the victims of
witchcraft. Put upon to tell who was causing their afflictions, the
girls finally accused three village women, and warrants were sworn
out for the arrest of Sarah Osburn, Sarah Good and Parris's slave,
Tituba.</p>
<p>On March 1, 1692, magistrates John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin
conducted an examination at the Meeting House. Sarah Good and Sarah
Osburn were separately examined and as they answered the questions
put to them, the "afflicted" girls went into horrific fits. To all
present, the girls were obviously victims of these women's
witchcraft. Though the two protested their own innocence, Tituba
unraveled a confession of meeting with the devil and stating there
were still other witches in the neighborhood. This evidence was
sufficient for the magistrates, and the three women were jailed.
The girls' afflictions did not abate, however, and still more
villagers became "afflicted."</p>
<p>Soon more accusations were made, and by the end of March Church
members Martha Cory and Rebecca Nurse were also arrested, examined
and jailed. No longer were just the lowly being accused, but people
formerly in good standing in the community. By May, scores of
"witches," both men and women, had been examined in Salem Village,
and jails were being filled with up to 150 accused persons from
many towns including Salem, Topsfield and Andover. Dozens of people
under excruciating religious, civil and family pressures found
themselves confessing to being witches.</p>
<p>In May, Governor William Phips called a special court to try the
cases of those accused witches who had not confessed. Convening in
Salem in June 1692, the court quickly condemned Bridget Bishop to
death. During July, August, and September, 18 people, including
Nurse, Good and Cory were hanged. In addition, one man, Giles Cory
of Salem Farms, died under torture. At least 5 others including
Sarah Osburn died in jail. By the new year the colony was becoming
exhausted with the witchcraft frenzy, and learned persons were
speaking against the validity of "spectral evidence" being used in
court. When the trials resumed, this former evidence was disallowed
and proof was insufficient to condemn any other accused. The witch
horror was over. Of the 19 people who were executed during this
tragic yet heroic period, 12 came from the Salem Village area,
dying rather than confessing to what they had not done.</p>
<p>In 1752 Danvers was officially established as a township
separate from Salem. The 1692 Salem Village witchcraft hysteria was
a chilling era of our history. Yet its lessons have meaning for us
today in that each generation must confront its share of
intolerance and "witch hunts" with integrity, clear vision and
bravery.</p>
