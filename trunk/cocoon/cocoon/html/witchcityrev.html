<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Witch City is a documentary film focused on what Salem,
Massachusetts has become three-hundred years after the Salem Witch
Trials The film examines the social, religious, and commercial
turmoil that plagues Salem even today. The documentary covers a
period of about five years beginning at the time of the
preparations for the tercentenary commemoration of the witch trials
and ending about three years later. Local film makers, Joe Cuthera
and Henry Ferrini intersperse hometown family footage with the
contemporary shots and interviews with Salem residents and visitors
to Salem's most famous tourist sites to create a diverse picture of
how Salem developed from 1692 to 1992.</p>
<p>Joe Cuthera is the friendly narrator who takes the audience with
him on his return to Salem, his hometown. His native accent guides
the audience as they walk with him through the streets of Salem
today and yesterday, introducing them to relatives and strangers
alike. Joe notes that the Salem of his boyhood cannot be found
easily in the Salem of the 1990's, and that what Salem has become
is a product of a misconception of what it was in the past.</p>
<p>After introducing the audience to Joe, the film turns to a brief
synopsis of what "really" happened in Salem in 1692. This brief
portion of the film stays close to historical facts, offering only
pieces of interpretation from notable scholars of the Salem Witch
Trials such as Stephen Nissenbaum, co-author of Salem Possessed and
editor of The Salem Witchcraft Papers. He tells the story of the
impressionable afflictedgirls finally succumbing to pressure from
their elders and naming names after an extended period of being
asked questions such as, "Who torments you? Give us a name. Was it
?" The historians also treat the socio-economic situation of those
involved, claiming that the accusations were from girls who lacked
some element of social importance and that the accusations
themselves were first directed at women lower on the socio-economic
scale. Nissenbaum then claims that, once the accusations started
implicating prominent people of Salem who would not have
participated in witchcraft, such as Increase Mather, it reached a
point when pressure began to end the trials. Throughout all of the
information given by the historians, Cuthera and Ferrini include
visuals of various paintings of the Trials and pictures of people
in period clothing, etc. to provide graphic support of what is
recounted by the historians. This method collapses the time frame
of the documentary since they use footage of plays and other such
popular culture mediums within Salem in the 1990's as they discuss
what took place in 1692 - a technique that places the two periods
in Salem's history in closer proximity to each other.</p>
<p>The documentary then returns to the Salem of the '90's, and
returns to the semiotics of representing Salem as the "Witch City."
The documentary hints that the beginning of commercial fascination
with the Salem Witch Trials began when Nathaniel Hawthorn
(descendant of Judge John Hathorne) began writing novels that
romanticized the tragic history of the town in his use of gothic
imagery in his depiction. Hawthorne created a fantasyland of
witches, mystical elements, and romance that Americans, and the
world, could not resist.</p>
<p>Exploring deeper into the Disneyland simulacrum that Salem
became after Hawthorne, the focus of the documentary is again
shifted to the owners of Salem's attractions, such as the Salem
Witch Museum, Wax Museum, and Dungeon Museum. The different
business leaders are questioned about the town and the present-day
interest in the trials, and why the have their businesses and what
they think of them. Bif Michaud, director of the Salem Witch
Museum, compares the Salem Witch Trials to the Holocaust during
World War II. "In any case, they [the victims of the Trials and the
Holocaust] are dead," Michaud states as a similarity between the
two tragic events. The misrepresentation is even further
demonstrated when they interview some tourists who, wanted to come
to see the Salem Witch Museum, did not even know what state it was
in until they arrived. Michaud, as with other business owners and
religious leaders, claims that he is not trying to commercialize
Salem - something that the directors do not admire. They do find
one man, later in the documentary, who admits that he's "out for a
buck" when he packages and sells dirt from Gallows Hill. The
commercialization segment ends with the filmmakers presenting the
packaged dirt (which was priced at $2.50) to Arthur Miller at the
unveiling of the winning model for the memorial. They then point
out that Miller, a man of words, is at a loss for words when he
sees an example of such shameless commercialization. The question
that the filmmakers do not ask of Miller, however, is if he is any
better as the creator and profiteer of the play The Crucible, a
moderately fictionalized account of the Trials.</p>
<p>The other section of the documentary that is presented
simultaneously with the commercialization segment focuses on the
present religious turmoil in Salem. The documentary focuses mainly
on the Wicca movement and their confrontations with Christian
fundamentalists. They interview several religious leaders, and
create a dizzying visual collage of the many different faiths at
odds with each other. Of particular focus is Laurie Cabot, named
"Official Witch of Salem" and a religious leader within the Wicca
movement. The filmmakers do question Cabot's motives in relation to
her desire and willingness to have so much publicity, commercial
and otherwise, and her attachment to her faith. The "Heritage Day
Parade" that is shown from Joe's childhood at the beginning is
recapitulated at this point in the film in its current form, with
religious turmoil angrily displayed between groups and ending with
one Wiccan's observation of the anti-Wiccan protesters, "Do you see
that? It's all about hate!"</p>
<p>The climax of all of the tension that the filmmakers capture is
the creation and execution of the Tercentennial Commemoration of
the Trials. The religious and commercial strife comes to a breaking
point when Michaud, one of the primary monetary contributors to the
Tercentenary, is placed upon its planning board and no Wiccans are.
However, the Tercentenary is still depicted as a success. In an
eerie recapitulation of an earlier moment when Michaud equates the
Trials with the Holocaust, one of the primary speakers at the
Memorial dedication is Elie Wiesel, a famous and prolific writer
who survived the Holocaust. Wiesel declared at the dedication, "It
is because people were fanatics that Salem was possible it is so
easy to believe fanaticism is the worst evil then and that faces us
today there are more Salems."</p>
<p>Three years later is where the documentary then picks up, and it
begins with the changes in the Chamber of Commerce's "Haunted
Happenings" celebration in October. The religious strife is no
longer the most critical issue - in fact, Wiccans and members of
other faiths work together at this point to better Salem. However,
Salem's commercialization has grown worse. The theme for Haunted
Happenings is "Stop by for a Spell" and the event has been extended
to three weeks, with the hopes that it will be a month-long event
by the next year.</p>
<p>Witch City ends with Joe's comment that in Salem, "good commerce
is the rule by which everything evolves" but that is the strongest
statement he makes. The subtle undercurrents of disapproval that
run throughout the film are undercut by its lack of a strong point
of view and its own participation as a commercial product focused
on the Trials. Throughout all of subtleties, however, the film is
an engaging representation of the problems and complications of
commercialization upon tragic events in the commodified world of
America today.</p>
