<p>The Salem witchcraft outbreak of 1692 is one of the most
notorious incidents of colonial American history. Historian Richard
B. Trask has re-examined, newly transcribed and arranged in
chronological order all the legal, ecclesiastical and other
surviving sources relating to the beginnings of the witchcraft
hysteria during March 1692. Also included is the important
witchcraft sermon, <i>Christ's Fidelity,</i> delivered in March by
Rev. Deodat Lawson and reprinted here for the first time since its
1704 publication.</p>
<p>The important characters of the witch outbreak come alive to the
reader, who learns what they said and did, and how this local
incident evolved into the largest "witch hunt" in American history.
Cases represented include those of Sarah Good, Sarah Osburn,
Tituba, Martha Cory and Rebecca Nurse. To help the reader capture
an inclusive picture of 1692, the author begins with a helpful
introduction, and appends sections dealing with the population of
the 1692 village, biographies of the 67 chief characters, excerpts
from English witchcraft volumes used by the Salem inquisitors, and
narratives of the March events recorded by 17th century writers.
Illustrated are an early map of the center of Salem Village, a
portrait of Rev. Samuel Parris, artifacts excavated from the
minister's parsonage in 1970, and pictures of sites, houses and
documents.</p>
<p>Nineteen witchcraft documents, previously thought to be lost
forever, have been discovered and gathered by the author and are
reproduced here together for the first time! Dating between April
and September 1692, these documents include examinations,
indictments, and depositions relating to accused witches Giles Cory
of Salem Farmes, Mary English of Salem, Margaret Scott of Rowley,
Rachel Clinton of Ipswich, Mary Lacey, Sr. and Jr., Richard Carrier
and Rev. Francis Dane of Andover, Margaret Prince and Joanna Penny
of Gloucester, Mary Green and Hannah Bromage of Haverhill, and Rev.
George Burroughs of Wells, Maine. The preliminary examination of
Cory, who was later tortured to death, is the only record of his
words to the court in 1692; while the six documents relating to
Margaret Scott, who was executed on September 22, 1692, adds
significant information to the only two previously known
manuscripts concerning her case.</p>

<p>"THE DEVIL hath been raised amongst us, &amp; his Rage is
vehement &amp; terrible, &amp; when he shall be silenc'd the Lord
only knows." So wrote Samuel Parris, the pastor of Salem Village,
in his church record book in late March 1692 when confronted with
what was discovered to be a diabolical occurrence taking place in
this small Massachusetts hamlet.</p>
<p>What at first seemed only a localized witchcraft outbreak soon
would spread rapidly and by the end of May 1692 people from
communities as distant and diverse as Salem, Billerica, Andover,
Charlestown, Marblehead, Lynn, Reading, Topsfield, Gloucester,
Malden, and Beverly would be accused by various "afflicted persons"
of using witchcraft upon them. By the fall of 1692 over 150 people
had been examined and sent to prison. Men and women, both rich and
influential as well as poor and hapless, were enmeshed in
frightening legal confrontation. Some 50 falsely confessed to being
witches who, in exchange for special powers and favors, had made a
covenant with the Devil to assist in his assault upon the people of
the colony. Nineteen persons who staunchly maintained their
innocence were tried, found guilty and hanged, while one old man
was tortured to death, and at least five others died in prison
succumbing to harsh conditions and treatment.</p>
<p>The story of the Salem Village witch hysteria is a minor, though
well-known footnote in American colonial history. Its popular
fascination has continued to make it the subject of innumerable
scholarly as well as superficial books and articles. In our own
time the expression "A Salem Witch Hunt" is often used as a
universal phrase which points to a scapegoating position taken by
people or groups emphasizing hysterical, blindly illogical and
intolerant actions or expressions.</p>
<p>What was the cause of the historical 1692 Salem witch hunt, the
largest witch outbreak in America, that occurred at a time when the
earlier, massive witch hunts of Europe were on the wane? Writers
and researchers since the last decade of the 17th century down to
the present time have been trying to find a theory or an
explanation to this question. Colonial clerics, including John Hale
and Cotton Mather, saw these events as the direct intervention of
the Devil attacking the Puritan Commonwealth and being partially
successful as the result of a religious backsliding of New
Englanders and the use by civil authorities of ill-conceived
traditions and non-biblical principles to discover who was a witch.
Later authors would come up with a wealth of hypotheses to describe
the causes, postulating among other explanations that it resulted
from the pranks of bored adolescents, the influence of oligarchical
and power-hungry clergy, local petty jealousies and land grabs,
mental aberrations, spiritualist goings-on, political instability,
a conspiratorial holding action against the disintegration of
Puritanism, mass clinical hysteria, a clash between agrarian and
emerging commercial interests, a continuation of the suppression of
certain types of women, and even physical reactions to ingested
fungus. Besides the mysterious quality of the subject matter, the
Salem cases have always afforded the researcher a fairly extensive
accumulation of primary source documents representing a diversity
of people, yet combined with a body of knowledge that is manageable
enough to be examined in microcosm.</p>
<p>The ordinary English Puritan settler in 17th century New England
believed, as did his European counterpart, in the existence of a
literal Devil and the possibility of witchcraft affecting his
everyday life. Witches were thought to be humans, typically women,
who had agreed to serve the Devil. In return for favors and certain
amazing powers from the Devil, they attempted to help "The Old
Deluder" bring ruin upon the Christian community.</p>
<p>On continental Europe beginning in the 15th century, literally
tens of thousands of "witches" had been discovered and put to
death. There, witchcraft was considered a heresy against the
church, and heretics were burned at the stake. Because of geography
and certain cultural and religious differences, England had escaped
the brunt of the continental-style witch hunts for many years. It
was not until the mid-sixteenth century in England that witchcraft
became a crime punishable by death. From then through the end of
the 17th century an estimated one thousand English witches would be
found out and hanged. In England witchcraft was considered a felony
against the state, and felons were hanged. Major English witch
outbreaks typically occurred during those periods of social or
political strife as, for example, during the Civil War when in less
than two years in the mid 1640s about 200 witches were executed
following their discovery by a merciless and deceitful man named
Matthew Hopkins, who was dubbed the "Witch Finder General."</p>
<p>The English settlers of 17th century New England did on occasion
find witchcraft at work within their various communities, and
although a large-scale witch outbreak did not occur prior to 1692,
over 90 individual complaints and accusations took place before
that date.</p>
<p>One of the larger Massachusetts Bay towns was Salem, first
occupied by Englishmen in 1626. Soon a large migration of people
followed from the mother country. By the mid 1630s with the
available land of this coastal community quickly diminishing and
the desire for larger and better farmland, a group of settlers
established homesteads to the west of Salem some five to ten miles
from the town center. This area soon became known as Salem Village,
and by the 1660s included a substantial collection of widely
scattered farms.</p>
<p>Once established, the farmers or "villagers," as they began to
refer to themselves, saw that they had less and less in common with
Salem and began to look towards their own self-interests. Many
resented their subservient position to the more mercantile and
distant townspeople, and beginning in 1667 with a group of
villagers petitioning to be exempt from the Salem military watch,
"considering how remote our dwellings are from the Town," the
farmers pressed towards becoming independent from their mother
community. Salem, having previously lost significant territory to
other developing settlements, was not eager to grant any such new
request. For the major part of a century through delaying
counter-proposals, political clout and obstinacy the town
staved-off losing the valuable and taxable village territory.</p>
<p>Turning to the General Court for possible relief, the villagers
petitioned for permission at least to build their own meeting house
and hire a minister to preach among them. In 1672 Salem relented to
the religious argument, and the village was allowed to establish a
parish.</p>
<p>A parish was not an independent church, however, and although
the villagers could choose from among themselves a five-man
committee to assess support for a minister and a building, the
chosen minister was not an ordained pastor and theirs was not an
independent, covenant church. Villagers who desired full church
membership and participation in communion at the Lord's Table would
continue to be required to travel the many miles to the Salem
church. Though the villagers were free from paying Salem church
rates, for all other purposes, taxing and political, they were
legally part of Salem Town. Many but not all of the approximately
550 villagers still desired full independence, both ecclesiastical
and political, from the town, and they pressed the issue on
numerous occasions. It would not be until the 1750s, however, that
Salem Village would be finally granted its full independence with
the establishment of the Town of Danvers.</p>
<p>Even while they possessed a semblance of ecclesiastical
independence, a divisive inter-village religious factionalism
emerged resulting in much controversy during the three, short term,
successive ministeries which served the village from 1672 to 1688.
Ministers James Bayley, George Burroughs, and Deodat Lawson seemed
never to gain the endorsement and support of more than a simple
majority of the villagers, and typically found themselves entangled
in heated, uncharitable controversy with a vocal minority. Upon
finding the situation not worth the fight, each would unhappily
depart the village.</p>
<p>In a 1682 letter villager Jeremiah Watts complained concerning
the local factionalism, "Brother is against brother and neighbors
against neighbors, all quarreling and smiting one another." Still
later in the 1680s during a dispute involving Rev. Lawson, a
committee of arbitrators from Salem commented in their written
advice to the village that "uncharitable expressions and uncomly
reflections tost [sic] to and fro ... have a tendency to make such
a gap as we fear, if not timely prevented, will lett out peace and
order and let in confusion and every evil work." Among the arbiters
in this February 1687 communication were future witchcraft judges
John Hathorne and Bartholomew Gedney.</p>
<p>Although much of the contentiousness and quarreling over village
ministers was indeed homegrown, Salem Town shared part of the blame
in its heavy-handed dealings with the village. Salem Village was in
an unenviable position. It sorely lacked those traditional
institutions meant to assist in the governing and the stability of
New England communities. The village church could congregate, tax
itself, and worship, but was denied performing its own sacraments
or holding its own covenant. The Village Committee could be elected
and meet, but it was a governing body in name only, not able to act
on its own or the inhabitants' self-interest and forced to appeal
to the town selectmen on any substantive issues. Though by no means
the only explanation for the village's problems with factionalism,
this vacuum of power greatly exacerbated its difficulties. A not
inconsequential number of villagers also had a vision and an
empathy more in keeping with the mercantile interests of Salem Town
rather than with the agrarian outlook of Salem Village. With these
significant political, religious, social, and economic differences
existing from without and from within the village society, it is
not difficult to understand why the area had acquired a regional
reputation for provincialism and ill-feeling.</p>
<p>By 1689 the villagers in a seemingly unusual spirit of
cooperation pushed hard for a completely independent church, while
at the same time hiring their fourth successive minister, Samuel
Parris. By a chance of circumstances, the request was granted from
the Salem mother church and on November 19, 1689, the Rev. Mr.
Samuel Parris was ordained pastor of the newly created and
independent Church of Christ at Salem Village, with twenty-seven
adults joining together in full covenant.</p>
<blockquote><a href="Parris.html">Portrait of Samuel
Parris</a></blockquote>
<p>What at first seemed a fresh and positive beginning, soon took
on the same old attitudes and style of former controversies.
Thirty-five-year-old Rev. Parris was a novice to the ministerial
calling, having engaged for much of his adult life in the
mercantile field. After over a decade of attempting to make a
successful living in the Barbados, West Indies, and then in Boston,
Parris gradually changed his life's course to become a minister for
Christ. Through truncated negotiations in 1688 and 1689 with
various small committees purporting to fully represent the will of
the village inhabitants, Parris eventually acquired for himself
what he felt to be adequate terms for his calling among the
farmers. Though his salary was smaller and included less hard
currency than he had initially desired, he concluded that it was
sufficient for him and his family. He had also wrangled the major
concession of full ownership of the village-built 1681 parsonage
and its two-acre lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately everyone had not been privy to the full terms of
the agreement, or at least later claimed this to be the case. A
vociferous minority, primarily of non-church member inhabitants,
saw the settlement agreement as unwarrantable and an illegal
give-away of their village-owned parsonage. As a contemporary
chronicler of the witchcraft events, Robert Calef, would write of
the parsonage dispute, "This occasioned great Divisions both
between the Inhabitants themselves, and between a considerable part
of them and their said Minister, which Divisions were but the
beginning or Praeludium to what immediately followed." Slowly
festering, the controversy continued to build until by October 1691
the opposition faction made its move. In the annual election of the
Village Committee, the old committee made up of the minister's
church supporters was ousted and a new committee composed of Joseph
Porter, Francis Nurse, Joseph Putnam, Daniel Andrews, and Joseph
Hutchinson, most if not all strong opponents of Parris, was
installed. When called upon by the church in November 1691 to begin
the gathering of taxes to support the ministry, the committee,
whose primary duty this was, chose instead inaction. Thereupon, the
church voted to sue the committee in court. The two village
institutions had set their course of confrontation, and villagers
were placed in the unenviable position of choosing sides.
Meanwhile, his firewood supply virtually depleted, the minister
entreated his congregation to provide him with wood for heating and
cooking. Even this request was tinged with controversy. Parris
expected the wood to be brought forth and stacked upon his wood
pile by his respectful congregation. Most villagers, however,
believed Parris's salary included a wood allotment payment and that
he should not presume to be above making arrangements for his own
wood.</p>
<p>From the scant written sources which survive, Parris appears to
have been a man of strong will who expected the deference from his
people which was customarily given to respected community
ministers. A good portion of the inhabitants were unwilling to give
Parris, both as to his personal comfort among them and in their
acknowledgment of him as their spiritual guide, either their
generosity of spirit or of purse. An examination of Parris's
surviving sermon outlines, particularly those written during the
last quarter of 1691, seem to include thinly veiled references to
his dissatisfaction with his lot among them. He often preached on
the theme of conflict between good and evil, Christ and Satan, and
enemies who are both within and without the church.</p>
<p>Besides these ever-present conflicts within the village and
between the village and the town, the inhabitants of Salem Village
were part of the larger community of the Massachusetts Bay and New
England. The times were full of uncertainty and apprehension. Many
clergy spoke of the backsliding of the current generation of New
Englanders into a less God-fearing and righteous-living society,
and suggested that in answer to these sins God might allow
tribulation to befall His wayward people. Indians and the French to
the north were a constant threat. In early 1692 Abenaki Indians had
resumed bloody warfare by viciously attacking settlements in Maine,
killing or carrying off inhabitants at York and Wells and burning
many houses. These attacks led Essex County people to fear that
this was the beginning of another war on the scale of the King
Philip's War of the mid 1670s when many Salem Village soldiers had
died and when the village had erected a watch house and fortified
the meeting house. Indeed not too long before 1692 several young
village men on duty elsewhere had died in Indian attacks.</p>
<p>The political scene in Massachusetts was also a matter of
concern. In 1684 the colony had lost its self-governing charter and
the Crown's newly appointed governor, Sir Edmund Andros, arrived in
1686. It was unclear during this period if the land granted under
the old charter would be considered valid by the new power. With
the excuse of the "Glorious Revolution" in England, Massachusetts
in 1689 revolted against Andros and set up its own commonwealth
based on the old charter. Rev. Increase Mather had been sent to
England as advocate for Massachusetts concerning a new charter. The
success or failure of his venture was unknown and the cause of much
apprehension. Thus the bleak midwinter of 1691-1692 was a period of
uneasiness in the colony. Little Salem Village with its divisive
social structure and scattered population faced not only
consternation from without, but also a continuation of the
institutional difficulties with Salem and significant internal
stress over its own religious community.</p>
<p>Just when a strange malady first struck several children in the
minister's house and that of several of his neighbors' homesteads
is unclear. By late January and early February of 1692, a number of
locals knew that something was amiss, however. Two of the
youngsters in the Parris household, daughter Betty, age 9, and
niece Abigail Williams, age 11, together with Ann Putnam, Jr., the
daughter of staunch Parris supporter Thomas Putnam, who lived less
than a mile from the parsonage, were affected. Putnam's wife's
niece, Mary Walcott, the 17-year-old daughter of Jonathan Walcott
who lived within a stone's throw of the parsonage, was also " . . .
afflicted by they knew not what distempers." While it would later
be speculated that these adolescent girls and perhaps others were
dabbling in unhealthy and sinful games of divination, attempting to
find out by means of white witchcraft their future fate, what
caused their fits is not clearly known. Though presumed by later
writers, it is unclear if Tituba, Rev. Parris's Indian slave, had
any hand in letting the impressionable girls have their forbidden
sport and encouraged or at least did not prevent their irreligious
games.</p>
<p>An undoubtedly chagrined Parris must have seen these young
girls' actions as extremely dangerous signs. The fits they
exhibited were not simply playful; and instead of diminishing over
time, they seemed to intensify and infect others. Rev. John Hale of
Beverly, an observer of many of these early happenings, would in
later years, describe the symptoms:<br /></p>
<blockquote><tt>These children were bitten and pinched by invisible
agents; their armes, necks, and backs turned this way and that way
.... Sometimes they were taken dumb, their mouths stopped, their
throats choaked, their limbs wracked and tormented so as might move
an heart of stone, to sympathize with them, with bowels of
compassion for them.</tt></blockquote>
<br />
<p>As these torments continued, they became the talk of the
village, and many saw a clear comparison of what was presently
occurring in Salem Village with the reported afflictions of the
Goodwin children who had been tormented by a witch in Boston in
1689. Other classic English bewitchment cases were also brought to
mind.</p>
<p>Rather than separating the affected children as had been done
with successful results in the Boston case by Rev. Cotton Mather,
the village parents seem to have allowed the children to keep
together. This did not quiet the situation, but rather encouraged
its festering. The anxious elders, undoubtedly guided by Rev.
Parris, held prayer meetings with the children present. They also
held private fasts and called upon the neighborhood ministers to
visit and pray over the girls at the parsonage and elsewhere.</p>
<p>A local physician, most probably William Griggs, was also called
to offer his assistance and advice. Finding no physical malady he
could identify as to the cause, he suggested that their afflictions
were likely to be the result of bewitchment, an explanation that
others quickly embraced as logical considering the evidence. The
teenage maid living with the Griggs family also became an early
sufferer of this same strange affliction.</p>
<p>Once it was recognized that these were no epileptic-like
seizures or anything of that type and that the problem was
spreading to others, many felt that firm action had to be taken.
The various private and public fasts and the patient, continual
praying and the waiting upon Providence was too ineffectual for
some. Concerned adults began pressing the young ones to discover
who or what agent was hurting them.</p>
<p>Some sincere but meddling neighbors dabbled in white witchcraft
in an attempt to discover the cause of the afflictions. Mary Sibley
directed Parris's slaves to concoct a witch cake utilizing the
children's urine, and when the minister later learned of this
abomination occurring under his roof, he severely and publicly
chastised the woman, and identified this occurrence as what he
perceived to be the new and dangerous plateau of allowing the Devil
entry into this sad and now horrific calamity.</p>
<p>Finally the girls, under now unknown pressures and from unclear
sources, named three tormentors. The accused were the safe kind of
victims to cry out upon. One, the minister's slave, another a
destitute woman of ill repute possessing a sharp tongue, and the
third a sickly woman who had avoided church attendance for over a
year and whose unsavory marital past had been the occasion for much
gossip, were safe choices. With the swearing out of warrants for
their arrest issued on February 29, 1692, Tituba, Sarah Good and
Sarah Osburn would become the first to be examined in relation to
the girls' afflictions. The events, the words and the actions that
would transpire at their examination, and the testimony and
evidence that would result would significantly transform this
seemingly typical and local witch incident. And it would be during
the critical first thirty-one days of the witchcraft outbreak that
the course would be set, the confrontation joined and the community
hysteria stoked, leading into the most dramatic, far reaching and
deadly witch hunt in all of American history.</p>
