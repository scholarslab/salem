<p><i>This portrait was found in 1982 among uncatalogued Endicott
papers in the Massachusetts Historical Society. On the enclosing
envelope William C. Endicott, Jr., had written, "Miniature of Rev.
Mr. [Samuel] Parris. " Parris in his 1720 will had made reference
to bequeathing "my own picture" to his son Noyes, and in 1790
another son, Deacon Samuel Parris, bequeathed to his son Samuel,
"my Grandfather's and father's pictures. " An 1839 letter by Rev.
G. W. Porter of Boston offered the loan "of the miniature Portrait
of the Revd Mr.Paris of Salem" to artist Washington Allston for
copying, an offer the artist declined. Although it is unknown how
and where Endicott acquired this miniature, it is well known that
he was an avid late 19th and early 20th century collector of local
history memorabilia.</i></p>
<p><i>The original brass-framed, color portrait measures 2 1/4 '
high by 1 3/4 " wide and is of the style typical of late 17th
century English artists. It portrays a fair-complected man with
aquiline nose, dark brown eyes and light brown, shoulder-length
hair. He appears to be in his 20s or 30s, is wearing a knotted
cravat and may very well be Samuel Parris prior to his religious
calling. If so, this is the only known portrait of any inhabitant
of 1692 Salem Village.</i></p>
