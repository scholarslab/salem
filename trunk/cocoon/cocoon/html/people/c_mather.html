<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Born on Feb. 12th 1663 into a family of renown New England
Puritan ministers, including Rev. John Cotton and Rev. Richard
Mather, Cotton Mather seemed destined to achieve fame. His own
father, Rev. Increase Mather, also held a position of prominence as
a well-admired political leader, minister of the South Church in
Boston, as well as the presidency of Harvard College. Excelling in
his entrance exams in Latin and Greek, young Cotton began his
schooling at Harvard at only 12 years of age. After receiving his
M.A. at age 18, he felt called to a life of service in the clergy.
A terrible stutter, however, forced him to delay entering the
ministry and the demands of preaching, and instead he entertained
the notion of becoming a doctor. Encouragement from a friend
eventually pulled him over this speech impediment and back to his
calling, although medicine remained a key interest throughout his
life. Mather preached his first sermon in August of 1680, and went
on to be ordained by 1685 at age 22. Besides his involvement with
the witch trials in Salem during the 1690s, Cotton Mather is
remembered as one of the most influential Puritan ministers of his
day. Never achieving his father's success as a political leader or
president of Harvard, Cotton made his mark through his efforts as a
master of the pen. By the end of his life, he had published over
400 of his works, ranging from the subject of witchcraft to
smallpox inoculation. His publication, <i>Curiosa
Americana</i>(1712-24), demonstrated his abilities as an
accomplished scientist, and earned him election to the prestigious
Royal Society of London, England. Although his efforts of
encouragement in smallpox inoculation were met with much resistance
and nearly killed his own son, he is recognized as having been a
progressive medical advocate for his day.</p>
<p>In regard to the Salem witch trials, however, it was Mather's
interest in the craft and actions of Satan that won him an audience
with the most powerful figures involved in the trial proceedings,
several of the judges and the local ministers in Salem. Before the
outbreak of accusations in Salem Village, Mather had already
published his account, <i>Remarkable Providences</i> (1684),
describing in detail he possession of the children of the Goodwin
family of Boston. Mather actually took the eldest of the children,
13-year-old Martha, into his home to make a more intense study of
the phenomenon. Later scholars have suggested that this book in
fact outlined the symptoms of clinical hysteria. It was this same
hysteria that provided the behavioral model for the circle of
"afflicted" girls during the trials in Salem. Mather, however, used
his experience with Goodwins to further his notion that New England
was in fact a battleground with Satan. Similar themes appear in his
sermons and in the Preface to one of his children's books, in which
he warns young readers: "They which lie, must go to their father,
the devil, into everlasting burning; they which never pray, God
will pour out his wrath upon them; and when they bed and pray in
hell fire, God will not forgive them, but there [they] must lie
forever. Are you willing to go to hell and burn with the devil and
his angels?". Thus, the subject of eternal damnation weighed
constantly upon Mather's mind, and it resonates in his own diary
accounts. Scholars suggest that Mather's dramatic descriptions the
devil's activity upon the young Goodwin children may have led to
the first cry of witchcraft among the young girls in Salem
Village.</p>
<p>Although Mather was not directly involved in the proceedings of
the Salem witch trials, he wrote a letter to one of the magistrates
in the trials, John Richards of Boston, urging caution in the use
of spectral evidence. Mather was also the author of the "Return of
the Several Ministers," a report sent to the judges of the Salem
court. This carefully-worded document advised caution in the use of
spectral evidence, saying that the devil could indeed assume the
shape of an innocent person, and decrying the use of spectral
evidence in the trials, their "noise, company, and openness", and
the utilization of witch tests such as the recitation of the Lord's
Prayer. However, the final paragraph of the document appears to
undercut this cautionary statement in recommending "the detection
of witchcrafts". Thus, in Bernard Rosenthal and Perry Miller's
opinions, the courts interpreted the letter as Mather's seal of
approval for the trials to go on.</p>
<p>Accounts of eye-witnesses and historians paint a more
contradictory portrait of Mather's hand in the trials. Mather is
haunted in history by the account given in Robert Calef's book
<i>More Wonders of the Invisible World</i> (1700) of his conduct at
the hanging of former Salem minister George Burroughs. Calef
reported that Burroughs recited a perfect rendition of the Lord's
Prayer while on the gallows, something Mather himself thought
impossible for anyone guilty of an alliance with the devil. The
crowd was so moved that some wanted to prevent the execution.
Mather, mounted on his horse, proclaimed that Burroughs was no
ordained minister, and that the "Devil has often been transformed
into an Angel of Light." With those words, under the tearful gaze
of an ambivalent crowd the George Burroughs was hanged.</p>
<p>Perhaps Cotton's most self-damning act within the public eye was
his publication of the volume <i>The Wonders of the Invisible
World,</i> in October, 1692, after the final executions. Although
Cotton's words describe, and to some degree justify the trials and
deaths in Salem that year, the book is anything but resolved with
regards to Mather's true feelings about the trials. Although Cotton
insists the book is not written in an evil spirit or with any
prejudice, he writes of the trials of accused witches such as
Bridget Bishop saying there was "little occasion to prove
witchcraft, it being evident and notorious to all beholders". He
describes Susanna Martin as, "one of the most impudent, scurrilous,
wicked creatures in the world". And worst of all, he condones the
use of the spectral evidence to convict the witches of his five
cases outlined! In his own letter to William Stoughton, penned
during the trial of George Burroughs, Cotton also asserts the guilt
of this man, stating he is the ringleader of 10 other witches, a
confession received from five Andover witches that "refreshes his
soul".</p>
<p>Careful analysis of the document, as well as Mather's own
diaries, reveals that he may not have been quite as convinced of
the righteousness of the trials as he describes in his book. A
cautious foreword to the manuscript reads, "I live by Neighbours
that force me to produce these undeserved lines". Perry Miller
describes the whole work as "utter confusion". Robert Calef, author
of <i>More Wonders of the Invisible World,</i> published a very
different account than Mather's that put Cotton on the defensive
for the rest of his life. Mather cried libel and threatened to sue,
but the issue was never resolved and Cotton was forced to bite his
tongue and bear what would become a flood of contemporary scorn for
his witch-hunting labors. Near the end of his life, his diary
records a hint of regret for the thanklessness of the groups he had
spurned in his work. He is baffled by why "everybody points at me,
and speaks of me as by far the most afflicted minister in all New
England". Perry Miller describes Cotton's later years as a time of
intense regret and remorse about the trials. He points out that
Cotton's diary paints a picture of a man "panicky lest the Lord
take revenge upon his family 'for [Mather's] not appearing with
Vigor enough to stop the proceedings of the Judges'". Clearly
Cotton could not see his outside of his own world of expectations,
reputations, and contradictions. He died on Feb. 13th 1728 at age
66, survived by only one of his three wives and two of his fifteen
children.</p>
