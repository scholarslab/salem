<p>Bridget Bishop was a self-assertive woman who had been accused
of witchcraft prior to 1692. Previous experience had taught her to
deny allegations of witchcraft at all costs. Unfortunately, in 1692
the situation was different and her only salvation lay in false
confession, which she refused to do. Bridget Bishop was married to
Edward Bishop when she was accused of witchcraft in Salem. She was
widowed twice before marrying Edward. Her second husband Thomas
Oliver accused her of witchcraft, claiming that "she was a bad
wife. . . the devil had come bodily to her . . . and she sat up all
night with the devil." This previous accusation of witchcraft in
1680 was remembered and probably explains her arrest and sentencing
in 1692.<br /></p>
<p>John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin presided over Bridget's
examination on April 19, 1692. Many of her accusers were present at
the examination, including Elizabeth Hubbard, Ann Putnam, Abigail
Williams, Mercy Lewis, and Mary Walcott. A summary of the courtroom
examination follows.<br />
<br />
As soon as Bridget Bishop entered the courtroom, the afflicted
girls fell into fits. Judge Hathorne asked which witchcrafts she
was conversant in, to which she replied, "I take all this people
(turning her head and eyes about) to witness that I am clear." Then
Hawthorne asked the girls if they had been afflicted by Bishop, to
which Elizabeth Hubbard, Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, and Mercy
Lewis affirmed that she had. The afflicted girls charged her with
having hurt them in many ways and tempting them to sign the book of
the devil. Ann Putnam even went so far as to say that Bishop called
the devil her God. Bishop continued to proclaim her innocence by
saying that she "never saw these persons before, nor [ever] was in
this place before." She claimed to be as "innocent as an unborn
child."</p>
<p>At that point, Mary Walcott said that her brother Jonathan had
torn Bishop's coat while fighting off her specter. When they
examined Bishop's coat, they found the tear in exactly the same
location. Judge Hathorne continued the attack on Bishop when he
accused her of bewitching her first husband to death. She shook her
head no in response to the question, which set the afflicted girls
into fits. Sam Braybook affirmed that although she told him that
she had been accused of witchcraft ten years ago, "she was no witch
and the devil cannot hurt her."<br />
<br />
Bridget Bishop apparently became frustrated with Hathorne's
continual attack on her character and his disbelief in her
innocence. Her deferential attitude soon gave way to anger as she
slowly realized that denial was not an effective strategy. The
following interchange between Bishop and Hathorne is very memorable
and is often quoted.</p>
<p>Bishop staunchly states, "I am no witch." To which Hawthorne
replies, "Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how
far you have gone? Have you not to do with familiar spirits?" "I
have no familiarity with the devil." "How is it then that your
appearance doth hurt these?"<br />
"I am innocent."<br />
"Why do you seem to act witchcraft before us, by the motion of your
body, which seems to have influence upon the afflicted."<br />
"I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a
witch is."<br />
"How do you know then that you are not a witch."<br />
"I do not know what you say."<br />
"How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch
is."<br />
"I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it."<br />
"You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are
permitted"<br />
"I am innocent of a witch."</p>
<p>After this comment, Bridget apparently rolled her eyes towards
heaven. Immediately, all the girls rolled theirs, and it seemed to
the court that a devil was on the loose. After this examination,
Bishop was asked if she was not troubled to see the afflicted girls
so tormented. She answered no. When asked if she thought they were
bewitched, she answered that she did not know what to think about
them.</p>
<p>Cotton Mather, using the court records, wrote about the trial of
Bridget Bishop in his book <b>Wonders of the Invisible World</b>.
The trial was held on June 2, 1692 in the Court of Oyer and
Terminer. Even Mather admitted that it was hard to prove the
witchcraft, even though "it [was] evident and notorious to all
beholders." During Bishop's examination before the magistrates, the
afflicted girls behaved as if they were tortured. It seemed that by
casting her eye upon them, Bishop could strike them down into fits.
The only thing that would stop these fits was the touch of her hand
upon the girls. Abigail Hobbs, a woman who had already confessed to
being a witch, played into this drama by testifying that Bishop's
specter tormented her because of her confession. She also affirmed
that Bishop had been present at a meeting of witches, in a field at
Salem Village, and took part in a diabolical sacrament.</p>
<p>In addition to this evidence, evidence of other previous
witchcraft was brought to light. Bishop was accused of murdering
children, bewitching pigs, and coming to various townsmen during
the night. In further evidence, "poppets" were found in the wall of
her cellar. These puppets were made of rags and hogs bristles, with
headless pins in them. Bishop could "give no account unto the
court, that was reasonable or tolerable." The final piece of
damning evidence was when a jury of women found a "preternatural
teat" upon her body. Within three hours, the teat had disappeared,
adding to the intrigue.</p>
<p>Her case served as a model for future cases to come, following a
very predictable pattern. The afflicted girls made accusations,
which were denied by the accused; one or more confessors validated
the claim of the accusers; and members of the community told of
past acts of witchcraft by the accused. The court used spectral
evidence as the only legal basis to convict Bridget Bishop. Hanged
on June 10, her death warrant emphasizes only the harm done to her
accusers, primarily on the day of her examination, as the legal
justification for the execution. Bridget Bishop was the first
person to be hanged as a result of the infamous Salem witchcraft
trials.</p>
