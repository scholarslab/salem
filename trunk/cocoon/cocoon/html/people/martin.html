<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Maintaining her innocence up until the moment of her execution,
Susannah North Martin was hanged with four other women on July 19,
1692 during the outbreak of witchcraft accusations in Salem. At the
time of her execution Martin was 67 and a widow. She arrived in
Massachusetts in 1621 from Buckinghamshire, England, married the
blacksmith George Martin in Salisbury, in 1646 and had eight
children. During the course of her examination and trial 15 of
Martin's neighbors accused her of afflicting them through her
specter, by pinching them or causing their farm animals to die. The
Reverend Cotton Mather believed her to be "one of the most
impudent, scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the World" Brave and
outspoken, Martin refused to allow her accusers to shake her
convictions. Standing in the courtroom, confronted by girls
seemingly writhing from "afflictions" they blamed on her, Martin
maintained that she only "desire[d] to lead my self according to
the word of God." Asked what she then made of the afflicted girls,
she courageously suggested that they might be the ones under the
devil's influence, reminding the judges that, "He [the devil] that
appeared in the sam[e] shape a glorifyed saint can appear in any
ones shape." Her vehement denials made no difference; the court
only took her defiance as proof of her reprobate character.</p>
<p>Martin was no stranger to witchcraft accusations, having been
accused two decades earlier. Her husband, deceased by the time of
the Salem outbreak, had countered the charges of witchcraft and
infanticide with slander suites. Although he did not win
decisively, Susannah was acquitted in the criminal courts. In
public gossip, however, her reputation as a witch appears to have
continued irrespective of the court's findings.</p>
<p>At the same time as the first accusations of witchcraft Susannah
and her husband were involved in a series of legal battles over her
inheritance. In 1688 her father, Richard North, died leaving two
daughters, a granddaughter and his second wife to share his sizable
estate. To the surprise of Susannah and her sister, they received
only a tiny portion while the bulk of the estate passed to his
second wife, who died soon after her husband. Susannah's stepmother
left the majority of North's estate to his granddaughter,
continuing the exclusion of Susannah and her sister. From 1671 to
1674 Susannah's husband and her sister pursued a series of appeals,
all of which were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p>These familial disputes over inheritance were incorporated by
historian Carol Karlsen in <i>The Devil in the Shape of a Woman</i>
into her interpretation of the Salem outbreak in socio-economic
terms. Karlsen postulated that accused witches were not only poor,
disagreeable old women, but also women of social and economic
standing within their community. Specifically, Karlsen believes
there is a correlation between witchcraft accusations and
aberrations in the traditional line of property transmission. She
notes that property, particularly land, typically went to the male
relatives after the death of a parent. In the cases of many of the
accused women, however, Karlsen discovered a pattern of women
standing to inherit in the absence of male heirs. She develops this
theme, and Martin's place within her theory, in chapter three of
her book. Although Karlsen's book offers invaluable insights in the
role of gender in the Salem outbreak, in the case of Susannah
Martin her theory stretches a bit too thin. The inheritance debate,
which Karlsen cites as motivational for Martin's accusation, is
separated from the Salem outbreak by twenty years. Much fresher in
the minds of her accusers would be the outspokenness demonstrated
by her comments during her courtroom examination. In this case, the
accused fits very well with the stereotype of the accused witch as
a disagreeable old woman.</p>
<p>Martin's descendant, John Greenleaf Whittier, immortalized her
innocence and bravery in his poem <i>The Witches Daughter,</i>
published in 1857. Referring to Martin's refusal to lie to save her
life, Whittier wrote, "she whose speech was always truth's pure
gold/Heard, not unpleased, its simple legends told." Painting the
scene of a pious woman, ancient for her day at 67, passing the days
in jail, Whittier imagined Martin "who turned, in Salem's dreary
jail/Her worn old Bible o'er and o'er/When her dim eyes could read
no more." This theme of upright innocence also characterizes the
multiple web sites dedicated to the memory of Susannah Martin and
maintained by her modern descendants (see <a href=
"../oldpeople/www.rootsweb.com/~nwa/sm.html">www.rootsweb.com/~nwa/sm.html</a>
