<p>The Original Court Log</p>
<p>SALEM - Some of the most fascinating ar eas of the Salem Witch
Trials Documentary Archive have nothing to do with the hysteria of
1692. Probate records, for example, provide an amazing window into
everyday life in the Massachu setts Bay Colony, with meticulous
lists of household items, from land to furnishings to the contents
of the kitchen cupboard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, the records are a boon to the most active users of
Salem's Phillips Library -- genealogists.</p>
<p>Better yet, anyone with an In ternet connection can reach all
this at www.salemwitchtrials.org.</p>
<p>Site creator Benjamin Ray of the University of Virginia can't
hide his enthusiasm when he discusses the court records of Essex
County, volumes going back to 1636. He points out that 20th century
archivists at the Phillips Library did yeoman's work in laboriously
cataloging what's offered.</p>
<p>"What &nbsp; we're doing is leveraging work done at the Essex
Institute," he says.</p>
<p>The site's index alone is a treat to read. For example, in the
period from 1636 to 1656 a list of crimes includes such remarkable
accusa tions as "careless grinding and toll taking," "kissing,"
"meddling," "lust" "wearing silver lace<br />
contrary to God," and "uncharitable ness to a poor man in
distress."</p>
<p>Sometimes the crimes are not as exotic as the charge might
indicate, and a simple mouse click can take you right to the actual
language of the documents</p>
<ul>
<li>While the recordreads, "Jonathan Platt indevoring to drawe away
the afections of m. Rogers, his mayd is Judged to haue broken the
law and is fined," without the consent of friends."<br /></li>
<li>&nbsp; The ledgers show the Puritan concern for propriety, but
they seem eager as well to set things right in the end, as when,
"Math ew Stanley and Ruth Andrewes fined 50s or to be whipped for
for nication, but the fine to be remit ted if they marry
together."</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the entries are poignant, leaving the reader with
haunting questions:</p>
<p>"Mary Bidgood was required to appear for not repairing to her
husband in England. Neighbors testified that he could not maintain
her, nor did he require her to come to him, and by his letters had
left her to herself and her friends here. She was permitted to
remain for the present and 'to see what the pvydence of god may
lead unto afterward.'"</p>
<p>Establishing an American tradi tion, debt is the most common
crime, with more than 100 entries.</p>
<p>Drunkenness is also a frequent charge, a fact perhaps not
unrelated to numerous citations for slander and defamation, a
serious matter to a people who very much saw the value of a good
name.</p>
