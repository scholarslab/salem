		<field name="fulltext">(The Rev. John Hale et al. v. Bridget Bishop ) John Hale of Beverly
			aged about 56 yeares [torn] &amp; saith that about 5 or 6 years ago e Christian the
			wife of John Trask (living in Salem bounds bordering on the abovesaid Beverly) beeing in
			full comunion in o'r Church came to me to [de] sier that Goodwife Bish- op her Neighb'r
			wife of Edw: Bishop Jun'r might not be permitted to receive the Lords Supper in our
			church till she had given her the said Trask satisfaction for some offences that were
			against her.viz be- cause the said Bishop did entertaine people in her house at
			unseason- able houres in the night to keep drinking and playing at shovel-board whereby
			discord did arise in other families &amp; young people were in danger to bee
			corrupted &amp; that the s'd Trask knew these things &amp; had once gon into the
			house &amp; fynding some at shovel-board had taken the peices thay played with
			&amp; thrown them into the fyre &amp; had reprooved the said Bishop for
			promoting such disorders, But re- ceived no satisfaction from her about it. I gave s'd
			Christian Trask direction how to proceed farther in this matter if it were clearly
			prooved And indeed by the information I have had otherwise I doe fear that if a stop had
			not been putt to those disorders s'd Edw. Bishop's house would have been a house of
			great prophainness &amp; iniquity. But as to Christian Trask the next news I heard
			of her was that she was distracted &amp; asking her husband Trask when she was so
			taken [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came from] my house
			when shee complained against Goody Bishop . She continueing some time Distracted wee
			sought the Lord by fasting &amp; prayer &amp; the Lord was pleased to restore
			the s'd [Trask] to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her] distraction
			(&amp; took it then to bee only distraction, yet fearing sometimes somw't worse) but
			since I have seen the fitts of those bewitched at Salem Village I call to mind some of
			hers to be much like some of theirs. The said Trask when recovered as I understood it
			did manifest strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd Bishop's wife
			&amp; showed so much aversness from having any conversation that I was then troubled
			at it hopeing better of s'd Goody Bishop at that time for wee have since [torn] At
			length s'd Christian Trask [was] agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the
			forenoon at the pub- l [i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance &amp; so continued
			sometimes better sometimes worse unto her death, manifesting that shee under temptation
			to kill her selfe or somebody else. I enquired of Marg'rt Ring who kept at or nigh the
			house, what shee had observed of s'd Trask before this last distraction shee told [mee.]
			Goody Trask was much given to reading &amp; search the pro- phecys of scrip[ture].
			The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house she[e] came home
			&amp; said shee had been w'th Goody Bishop &amp; that they two were now friend
			or to that effect. I was oft praying w'th &amp; councelling of Goody Trask before
			her death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed more rationall
			&amp; earnestly desired Edw: Bishop might be sent for that shee might make friends
			with him, I asked her if shee had wronged Edw. Bishop shee said not that shee knew of
			unless it were in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th them
			&amp; throwing them into the fyre &amp; if she did evill in it she was very
			sorry for it &amp; desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her. this was
			the very day before she dyed, or a few days before. Her distraction (or bewitching)
			continued about a month and in those intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly
			desired prayers &amp; the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on
			her behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe &amp; I judge was her owne
			hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand. As to the wounds she dyed of I
			observed 3 deadly ones; apeice of her wind pipe cutt out. &amp; another wound above
			that threww the windpipe &amp; Gullet &amp; the veine they call jugular. So that
			I then judge &amp; still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th so short a pair of
			cissars to mangle her selfe so without some extraordinary work of the devill or
			witchcraft signed. 20. may 1692 by *John Hale. To severall parts of this testimony can

			Oliver: now wife to Edward Bishop did Come to my hous pretending to buy an old hh'd wc'h
			tho I asked verry little for: &amp; for all her pretended want She went away w'th
			out it: &amp; Sundry other tymes she came in a Smooth flattering maner in very
			Slighty Errants: we have thought Since on purpos to work mischief: at or very near this
			tyme o'r Eldest Child who promised as much health &amp; understanding both by
			Countenance and actions as any other Children of his years: was taken in a very drooping
			Condition and as She Came oftener to the hous he grew wors &amp; wors: as he would
			be standing at the door would fall out &amp; bruis his face upon a great Step Stone
			as if he had been thrust out bye an invisible hand: often tymes falling &amp;
			hitting his face in a very miserable maner: after this the abovesaid Oliver brought me
			apair of sleeves to dye &amp; after that Sundry peeces of lace Some of w'ch were Soe
			Short that I could not judge them fit for any uce: she p'd me 2 d for dying them w'ch 2
			d I gave to Henery Willms w'ch lived w'th me he told me put it in a purse among som
			other money w'ch he locked up in a box &amp; that the purs &amp; money was gon
			out of the Box he Could not tell how: &amp; never found it after just after the
			dying of these things this child taken in a terrible fit; his mouth &amp; Eyes
			drawne aside and gasped in Such a maner as if he was upon the point of death; after this
			he grew wors in his fits; and out of them would be allmost allways crying that for many
			months he would be crying till natures strenght was spent &amp; then would fall a
			sleep and then awake &amp; fall to crying &amp; moaning: that his very
			Countenance did bespeak Compassion; and at length wee p'rceived his understand- ing
			decayed Soe that wee feared (as it has Since proved) that he would be quite bereaft of

			&amp; wee have Called him; he would Com to the Edge of the board &amp; hold out

			Came a Stranger to my hous &amp; pittyed this Child and Said among other words wee
			are all borne Some to one thing &amp; Som to another; I asked him &amp; w't doe
			you Say this Child is borne too he replyed he is born to be bewitched and is bewitched I
			told him he did not know; he said he did know &amp; Said to me you have a neighbor

			did remember that mye [mye] wife had told me that goodwife Oliver had bin at the hous
			&amp; spoke to her to beat Henry Willms , that lived w'th us &amp; that she went

			within a wheel, at which our ears do tingle. Humbly craving continually your prayers and

			Last Night my Daughter Ann was grievously Tormented by Witches, Threatning that she
			should be Pressed to Death, before Giles Cory . But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious
			God, she had at last a little Respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a
			man in a Winding Sheet; who told her that Giles Cory had Murdered him, by Pressing him
			to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there appeared unto him, and Covenented with
			him, and promised him, He should not be Hanged. The Apparition said, God Hardened his
			Heart, that he should not hearken to the Advice of the Court, and so Dy an easy Death;
			because as it said, “It must be done to him as he has done to me.” The Apparition also
			said, That Giles Cory was Carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury had found the
			Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing was done before she was born.
			Now Sir, This is not a little strange to us; that no body should Remember these things,
			all the while that Giles Cory was in Prison, and so often before the Court. For all
			people now Remember very well, (and the Records of the Court also men- tion it,) That
			about Seventeen Years ago, Giles Cory kept a man in his House, that was almost a Natural
			Fool: which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him, among whom was Dr.
			Zorobbabel Endicot ; who found the man bruised to Death, and having clodders of Blood
			about his Heart. The Jury, whereof sev- eral are yet alive, brought in the man Murdered;
			but as if some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution of the Matter, the Court
			Proceeded not against Giles Cory , tho' it cost him a great deal of Mony to get off. (

			speake it, before whose aw- full Tribunall we know we shall ere Long appeare) nor of any
			other scandalouse evill, or miscaryage inconsistant with Christianity, Those who have
			had the Longest and best knowledge of us, being persons of good report, may be suffered
			to Testifie upon oath what they know concerning each of us, viz Mr. Capen the pastour
			and those of the Towne &amp; Church of Topsfield, who are ready to say somthing
			which we hope may be looked upon, as very considerable in this matter; with the seven
			children of one of us, viz Mary Esty , and it may be produced of Like nature in

			witches, or such as are afflicted, as is supposed, by witches may not be improved to
			con- demn us, without other Legal evidence concurring, we hope the Honoured Court
			&amp; Jury will be soe tender of the lives of such, as we are who have for many
			years Lived under the unblemished reputation of Christianity, as not to condemne them
			without a fayre and equall hearing of what may be sayd for us, as well as against us.
