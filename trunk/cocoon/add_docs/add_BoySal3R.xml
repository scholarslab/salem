			Martha Tyler ) Goodwife Tyler did say, that, when she was first apprehended, she had no
			fears upon her, and did think that nothing could have made her confess against herself.
			But since, she had found, to her great grief, that she had wronged the truth, and
			falsely accused herself. She said that, when she was brought to Salem, her brother
			Bridges rode with her; and that, all along the way from Andover to Salem, her brother
			kept telling her that she must needs be a witch, since the afflicted accused her, and at
			her touch were raised out of their fits, and urging her to confess herself a witch. She
			as constantly told him that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of witchcraft, and
			begged him not to urge her to confess. However, when she came to Salem, she was carried
			to a room, where her brother on one side, and Mr. John Emerson on the other side, did
			tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the Devil before her eyes at
			that time (and, accordingly, the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beat him
			away from her eyes); and they so urged her to confess, that she wished herself in any
			dungeon, rather than be so treated. Mr. Emerson told her, once and again, `Well, I see
			you will not confess! Well, I will now leave you; and then you are undone, body and
			soul, for ever.' Her brother urged her to confess, and told her that, in so doing, she
			could not lie: to which she answered, `Good brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if I
			confess, and then who shall answer unto God for my lie?' He still asserted it, and said
			that God would not suffer so many good men to be in such an error about it, and that she
			would be hanged if she did not confess; and continued so long and so violently to urge
			and press her to confess, that she thought, verily, that her life would have gone from
			her, and became so terrified in her mind that she owned, at length, almost any thing
			that they propounded to her; that she had wronged her conscience in so doing; she was
			guilty of a great sin in belying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long as she
			lived. This she said, and a great deal more of the like nature; and all with such
			affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it exceeds any pen to
			describe and express the same. (Charles W. Upham, Salem Witchcraft [Boston, 1867] II,

			who testifieth and saith that in the year 1674: we were a mowing to gether and one of us
			broak our sith and not haveing oppertunity jest then to mend that nor by another wee
			went to the house of John willes sen'r of Topsfeild to borow a sith: but when we came
			there there was no man att whom: but the said willes wife who is now Charged witch acts
			of wicthcraf: was with in: and we asked hir to lend us a sith but she said had noe siths
			to lend: but one of hir neighbors being also there said to us there is John willes
			jun'rs sith hanging in that tree which stood by the house you may take that and spake
			with him as you goe to your work for he is at worke neare the way as you goe along: and
			accordingly we took down the sith out of the tree and tould the old woman that we would
			ask leave of John willes jun'r for his sith before we used it but she was very angry and
			said it was a brave world that every one did what they would. however we went away with
			the sith: but we had not been gon very fare from the house but a litle lad came affter
			us whose name was Efraime willes: and tould us that his mother said we had best bring
			the sith back againe: or Elce it should be a dear sith to us: however. we went on our
			way with the sith and asked the Right owner of it leave for it before we used it and
			went to our work and cutt down as much grass that day as made about three load of hay:
			and Returned the sith to the owner: and after wards made up our hay: and afterwards went
			to carting of our hay and went into the meadow and loaded up one load very well and
			caried it whom: and went againe into the meadow and loaded a second load and [bound] it
			and went to Drive it whom: but when we came to drive our oxen wee could not make them
			stire the load tho we had six good oxen and the Two foremost oxen ware on the upland and
			the meadow very firme where we carted constantly: but we strived awhile to make our oxen
			goe but could not fit them along; att last one of our wheales fell in up to the stock
			altho the meadow was feirme: then we threw allmost all the hay ofe our cart and thought
			to trie to git out the cart with sum hay upon it but we could not then we said one to
			another it was in vain to s[t] rive for we thought gooddy willes was in the cart and
			then we threw of all the hay and then we tried to make our oxen draw out the emty cart
			which at first they could not doe: but att last the whele jumpt up at once we knew not
			how almost redy to thro down our oxen on their knees then againe we loaded up our load
			of hay very well and bound it: and away wee went with it very well tell we came near to
			a very dangeros hill to goe down with a load of hay: and then I the said Joseph Andrew
			was by the foremost oxen and[d] saw sumthing about as bigge as a dogge glance from a
			stump or root of a tree along by me and the oxen #[and the oxen] began to jump: but I
			could not stire from the place for I know not how long: and I the said John Andrew being
			by the hindmost oxen saw nothing but the oxen begining to jump I cast hold of one of the
			oxen boxes &amp; was caried down violently that dangerouse hill I know not how:
			where was a brooke at the bottom of it with a bridge and a ford: and the oxen ran into
			the ford and over thrue the load of hay their: and when I came to To understand where I
			was and saw the oxen ware all well I bega[n] to bethinke my self of my Brother Joseph:
			and Immediatly called him but he gave no answer. and I began to be trobled for him and
			went backward to wards the place where the oxen were affrighted and I called severall
			times but he gave me no answer at last I calle[d] and said the load is overthron then
			Immediatly he answered me and came unto me: but how the load should keep upon the wheles
			runing so violently down that dangerous hill: &amp; being over throne whare it was
			we can give no account unless it was don by summ diabolicall art: then againe we gott up
			our cart and loaded up our hay very firme resolving to gitt hom our load if we could tho
			it was night and wh[en] we had loaded we went to bind our load: but by all the Skill
			[and] strength we had we could now wayes bind our load with our Cart rope but it would
			hang lose on our load: however we went away whom with our load and it laid very well for
			all it was night and [our] load unbound: also before we got whom many of our friends and
			neighbors meet us being consarned for us because we ware so latte &amp; they also
			saw our cart Rope hang lose and tould us of it. and wee tould them what mishap we had
			that day: and they also tried to fasten the Rope but could not: all which made us then
			to think and ever sence have thought: and still doe thinke that Gooddy willes who now
			stands Charged with High suspition of severall acts of wicthcraft had a hand in our

			Salem Village aged about eighty &amp; one years with reference to John Willard of
			s'd Salem, lately charged with Witchcraft when he was at first complained of by the
			afflicted persons for afflicting of them he came to my house greatly troubled, desiring
			me with some other Neighbours to pray for him I told him I was then going from home,
			&amp; could not stay, but if I could come home before night I should not be
			unwilling, but it was near night before I came home &amp; so I did not answere his
			desire, but I heard no more of him upon that account. Whither my not answering his
			desire did not offend him, I cannot tell, but I was jealous afterwards that it did. A
			little after my wife &amp; I went to Boston at the last Election, when I was as well
			in health as in many yeares before, &amp; the Election day coming to my brother Lft
			Richard Way's house, at noon there were many friends to dine there, they were sat down
			at the Table, Mr Lawson &amp; his wife &amp; severall more, John Willard came
			into the house with my sone Henry Wilkins before I sat down, &amp; s'd Willard to my
			apprehension lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any, I did
			but step into the next room, &amp; I was presently taken in a strange condition, so
			that I could not dine, nor eat any thing, I cannot express the misery I was in for my
			water was sodainly stopt, &amp; I had no benefit of nature, but was like a man on a
			Rack, &amp; I told my wife immediately that I was afraid that Willard had done me
			wrong, my pain continuing &amp; finding no relief my jealousie continued: Mr Lawson,
			&amp; others there, were all amazed, &amp; knew not what to do for me: There was
			a Woman accounted skilfull came hoping to help me, &amp; after she had used means,
			she askt me whither none of those evil persons had done me damage. I said, I could not
			say they had, but I was sore afraid they had, she answered she did fear so too, as near
			as I remember. I lay in this case. 3. or. 4. dayes at Boston, &amp; afterwards with
			the jeopardy of my life (as I thought) I came home, &amp; then some of my friends
			coming to see me (&amp; at this time John Willard was run away) one of the afflicted
			persons Mercy Lewes came in with them, &amp; they askt whither she saw any thing:
			she said yes, they are looking for John Willard but there he is upon his Grandfathers
			Belly (&amp; at that time I was in grevious pain in the small of my Belly) I
			continued so in greivous pain &amp; my water much stopt till s'd Willard was in
			chains, &amp; then as near as I can guess I had considerable ease, but on the other
			hand in the room of a stoppage, I was vexed with a flowing of water, so that it was hard
			to keep my self dry. On the. 5. July last talking with some friends about John Willard
			some pleading his innocency &amp; my self &amp; some others arguing the
			contrary, within about 1/4 of an hour after that I had said it was not I, nor my son
			Benja Wilkins , but the testimony of the afflicted persons, &amp; the jury
			concerning the Murder of my Grandson Dan: Wilkins that would take away his life if any
			thing did, &amp; within about 1/4 hour after this was taken in the sorest distress
			&amp; misery my water being turned into real blood, or of a bloody colour &amp;
			the old pain returned excessively as before which continued for about 24. hours together

			Excellency the Governour, and Councill, &amp; Representatives, now Assembled at
			Boston. The Humble Address of the ministers, and of some of the Inhabitants of Andover.
			We being deeply sensible of the heavy judgment that the Righteous God hath brought upon
			this place, thought it our duty (after our earnest prayers to the God of Heaven, to give
			us help from our trouble) to lay before this Honourable Assembly, our present distressed
			estate, and to crave a redress of our greivances. It is well known that many persons of
			this Town, have been accused of witchcraft, by some distempered persons in these parts
			and upon complaint made have been apprehended and committed to prison. Now though we
			would not appear as Advocates for any who shall be found guilty of so horrid a crime,
			but we heartily desire that this place, and the whole land, may be purged from that
			great wickedness: yet if any of our #[freinds] friends and neighbours have been
			misrepresented, as tis possible some of them have been; wee would crave leave (if it
			might be without offence) to speak something in their behalf, haveing no other desighn
			therein, then that the truth may appear. We can truly give this Testimony of the most of
			them belonging to this Town, that have been accused, that they never gave the least
			occasion (as we hear of) to their neerest relations or most intimate acquaintance, to
			suspect them of witchcraft. Severall of the women that are accused were members of this
			church in full Communion, and had obtained a good report, for their blameless
			conversation, and their walking as becometh woemen professing godliness. But whereas it
			may be alledged, that the most of our people that have been apprehended for witchcraft,
			have upon Examination confessed it. To which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for
			those that freely and upon conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend the case
			of some of them to be otherwise. for from the information we have had and the discourse
			some of us have had with the prisoners, we have reason to think that the extream urgency
			that was used with some of them by their friends and others who privately examined them,
			and the fear they were then under, hath been an inducement to them to own such things,
			as we cannott since find thay are conscious of; and the truth of what we now declare, we
			judge will in time more plainly appear. And some of them have exprest to their
			neighbours that it hath been their great trouble, that they have wronged themselves and
			the truth in their confessions. We are also very sensible of the disstressed condition
			of severall poor familyes, on whom this great trouble is fallen; some #[more] of our
			neighbors are like to be impoverished &amp; ruin'd by the great charge they are at
			to maintain such of their familyes as are in Prison, and by the fees that are demanded
			of them, whose case we pray may be considered. Our troubles which hitherto have been
			great, we foresee are like to continue and increase, if other methods be not taken then
			as yet have been, for there are more of our neighb'rs of good reputation &amp;
			approved integrity, who are still accused, and complaints have been made against them,
			And we know not who can think himself safe, if the Accusations of children and others
			who are under a Diabolicall influence shall be received against persons of good fame. We
			thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good creditt among our selves,
			but some Honorable &amp; worthy men of other places, do suffer in their names by the
			acusations of afflicted people in this Town Thus haveing given your Honors some account
			of our present troubles, we crave pardon for our boldness in this Address, and humbly
			pray this Honored Court to take into their serious consideration our low and distressed
			estate: And that the only wise God may bless yo'r counsels &amp; Endeavors for the

			( New York Public Library -- Manuscripts and Archives Division ) (Statement by the Rev.
			Francis Dane on the Andover Outbreak -- January 1693) R'nd Sr; Whereas there have been
			divers reports raysed, how, and, by what hands I know not, of the Towne of Andover, and
			the Inhabitants, I thought it my bounden duty to give an account to others, so farr as I
			had the understanding of anything amongst us. Therefore doe declare, that I beleeve the
			reports have been Scandalous, and unjust, neither will bear the light, As for that, of
			the Sive, and Cisers I never heard of it, till this last Summer, and the Sabboth after I
			spake publiqly concerning it since which I beleeve it hath not been tryed, As for such
			things of Charmes, and ways to find their cattle, I never heard, nor doe I know any
			Neighbour that ever did so, neither have I any grounds to beleeve it. I have lived above
			Fortie fower yeares in the Towne, and have been frequent among the Inhabitants, and
			should certainely heard if so it had been. That there was a suspicion of Goodwife
			Carrier among some of us before she was apprehended, I know. As for any other persons, I
			had no suspicion of them, and had Charity been put on, the Divel would not have had such
			an advantage against us, and I beleeve many Innocent persons have been accused,
			&amp; Imprisoned, the Conceit of Spectre Evidence as an infallible mark did too far
			prevaile with us Hence we so easily parted with our neighbours of honest, &amp; good
			report, &amp; members in full Co[mbar Comment: ]union, hence we so easily parted
			with our Children, when we knew nothing in their lives, nor any of our neighbours to
			suspect them and thus things were hurried on, hence such strange breaches in families,
			-- severall that came before me, that spake with much sobrietie, professing their
			innocency, though through the Devils subtilty they were too much urged to Confesse, and
			we thought we did doe well in so doeing, yet they stood their ground professing they
			knew nothing, never saw the devil, never made a covenant with him, &amp; the like;
			&amp; some Children that we have cause to feare that dread has overcome them to
			accuse themselves in that they knew not. Stephen Johnson Mary Barker the daughters of
			Lieftenant Barker , and some others by what we had from them with suitable affections we
			have cause to beleeve they were in the truth, and so held to it, if after many
			indeavours they had #[been dismissed] not been overcome to say w't they never knew This
			hath been a trouble to me, considering how oft it hath been sayd you are a witch, you
			are guilty, &amp; who afflicts this maid or the like, &amp; more then this hath
			been sayd, charging persons with witchcraft, and what flatteries have past from:
			&amp; threats and telling them they must goe to prison &amp; this feare have
			caused many to fall. our Sinne of Ignorance wherein we thought we did well, will not
			excuse us when we know we did amisse but what ever might be a stumbling block to others
			must be removed, else we shall procure divine displeasure, &amp; Evills will
			unavoidably breake in upon us. Andover Jan 2. 92 Yours Sr who am though unworthie a
			friend to them that are friends to Sion. Concerning my Daughter Elizabeth Johnson I
			never had ground to suspect her: neither have I heard any other to accuse her, till [by]
			Spectre evidence she was brought forth, but this I must say, she was weake, and
			incapacious, fearfull. and in that respect I feare she hath. falsely accused her self
			&amp; others. Not long before that she was sent for she spake as to her owne
			particular, that she was sure she was no witch, and for her Daughter Elizabeth , she is
			but simplish at the best, and I feare the comon speech that was frequently spread among
			us, of their liberty, if they would confesse, and the like expression used by some, have
			brought many into a snare, the Lord direct &amp; guide those that are in place, and
			give us all submissive wills, &amp; let the Lord doe with me, &amp; mine, what
			seems good in his owne eys. ( Essex County Archives, Salem -- Witchcraft Vol. 1 Page 142

			Prayer with Fasting) By the Honble the Lt. Govr. Council &amp; assembly of his
			Majtye Province of ye Massachusetts Bay;in General Court assembled. Whereas the Anger of
			God is not yet turned away; but his Hand is still stretched out against his people; in
			manifold judgments; particularly, in drawing out to such a Length, the Troubles of
			Europe, by a perplexing War. And more Especially, respecting our selves in this
			Province, in that God is pleased still to go on in diminishing our substance cutting
			short our Harvest; blasting our most promising Undertakings; more ways than one,
			Unsettling of us; and by his more immediate Hand, snatching away many out of our
			Embraces by suddain &amp; violent deaths; even at this time when the Sword is
			devouring so many; both at home and abroad; and that after many Days of publick and
			Solemn addressing of Him. And altho, considering the many Sins prevailing in the midst
			of us, We cannot but wonder at the Patience and Mercy moderating these Rebukes; yet we
			cannot but also Fear, that there is somthing still wanting to accompany our
			Suplications. And doubtless there are some particular Sins, which God is angry with our
			Israel for, that have not been duely seen and resented by us, about which God expects to
			be sought, if ever He turn again our Captivity. Wherefore its Commandd &amp; Apointd
			that Thursday the Fourteenth of January next be observed as aDay of Prayer with Fasting
			throughout this Province; strictly forbidding all Servile Labour thereon. That so all
			God's people may offer up fervent Supplications unto him for ye preservation &amp;
			prosperity of his Majtys. Royal person &amp; Governmt and Success to attend his
			Affaires both at home &amp; abroad that all Iniquity may be put away, which hath
			stirred Gods holy Jealousie against this Land; that He would shew us what we know not,
			and help us, wherein we have done amiss, to doe so no more: And Especially, that
			whatever Mistakes, on either hand, have been fallen into; either by the body of this
			People, or any Orders of Men, referring to the late Tragedie raised amongst us by Satan
			and his Instruments, through the awfull Judgment of God; he would humble us therefore,
			and pardon all the Errors of his Servants and People that desire to Love his Name, And
			be attoned to His Land. That He would remove the Rod of the Wicked from off the Lot of
			the Righteous; That He would bring the American Heathen, and cause them to hear and obey
			his voice;Acts &amp; Resolves, vol. 7, appendix 2, p. 132.</field>

			Barker , Sarah Wilson , and Hannah Tyler ) We whose names are under-written, inhabitants
			of Andover; whenas that horrible and tremendous judgment beginning at Salem village in
			the year 1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at Mr. Parris's house,
			several young persons, being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for
			afflicting them, and many there believing it so to be, we being informed that, if a
			person was sick, the afflicted person could tell what or who was the cause of that
			sickness: Joseph Ballard , of Andover, his wife being sick at the same time, he, either
			from himself or by the advice of others, fetched two of the persons, called the
			afflicted persons, from Salem village to Andover, which was the beginning of that
			dreadful calamity that befel us in Andover, believing the said accusations to be true,
			sent for the said persons to come together to the meeting house in Andover, the
			afflicted persons being there. After Mr. Barnard had been at prayer, we were
			blindfolded, and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their
			fits and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as they said; and
			some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well, and that we
			were guilty of afflicting them: Whereupon, we were all seized, as prisoners, by a
			warrant from the Justice of the peace and forthwith carried to Salem. And, by reason of
			that sudden surprizal, we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime, we were
			all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated and affrighted even out of our
			reason. and our nearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition, and
			knowing our great danger, apprehended there was no other way to save our lives, as the
			case was then circumstanced, but by our confessing ourselves to be such and such persons
			as the afflicted represented us to be, they, out of tenderness and pity, persuaded us to
			confess what we did confess. And indeed that confession, that it is said we made, was no
			other than what was suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we were
			witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it was so; and our
			understandings, our reason, our faculties, almost gone, we were not capable of judging
			of our condition; as also the hard measures they used with us rendered us incapable of
			making our defence, but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and most of
			what we said, was but, in effect, a consenting to what they said. Some time after, when
			we were better composed, they telling us what we had confessed, we did profess that we
			were innocent and ignorant of such things; and we hearing that Samuel Wardwell had
			renounced his confession, and quickly after condemned and executed, some of us were told
			we were going after Wardwell. Mary Osgood , Mary Tiler, Deliverance Dane , Abigail
