 <p>Oh said some of the afflicted there is one whispering in her ears. There is 
some body will rub your ears shortly, said the examinant Immediately they were 
afflicted, and among others Mercy Lewes. Why do you threaten they should be 
Rubb'd? </p> 
 <p>I did not speak a word of Rubbing. </p> 
 <p>Many testifyed she did. </p> 
 <p>My meaning was God would bring things to light. </p> 
 <p>Your meaning for God to bring the thing to light would be to deliver these 
poor afflicted ones, that would not Rubb them. </p> 
 <p>This is unusual impudence to threaten before Authority. who hurts them 
now. </p> 
 <p>I know not. </p> 
 <p>They were rubbed after you had threatened them. </p> 
 <p>Mary Walcot, Abigail Williams &amp; Eliz: Hubbard were carried towards 
her, but they could not come near her </p> 
 <p>What is the reason these cannot come near you </p> 
 <p>I can not help it, I do them no wrong, they may come if they will Why you 
see, they cannot come near you </p> 
 <p>I do them no wrong </p> 
 <p>Note. The afflicted were much distressed during her examination. This is 
true account of the Examination of Dorcas Hoar without wrong to any party

 <head>(The Rev. John Hale v. Dorcas Hoar) </head> 
 <p> <name>John Hale </name> aged 56 yeares Testifieth  <date 
n=1692-07-06>6. 7. 1692 </date> That for severall yeares agoe formerly were 
storys told concerning  <name>Dorcas Hoar </name> her beeing a fortune 
teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should live poorely 
so long as her husband  <name>willm Hoar </name> did live, but the said will 
should dye before her, &amp; after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune 
of  <name>Ens: Corning </name> &amp; his wife who should dye.first &amp; 
that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two yeares agoe the s'd 
 <name>Dorcas </name> manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her 
former life &amp; that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, &amp; their were 
rules to know what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book 
&amp; evill art shee seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices: 
whereupon I had great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last 
spring I discovered 
 <pb n="398"> 
 
 
 
an evillractice had been between a servant of mine &amp; some of s'd 
 <name>Hoars </name> children in conveying goods out of my house to the 
s'd  <name>Hoars. </name> and I had a daughter 
 <name>Rebecca </name> then between 11 &amp; 12 years old, whome I 
asked if she knew of the  <name>Hoars </name> stealing: she told me yea, 
But durst not reveale it to me, &amp; one reason was, she was threatened that 
 <name>Goody Hoar </name> was a witch &amp; had a book by w'ch shee 
could tell what s'd  <name>Rebecca </name> did tell me in my house &amp; 
if the s'd  <name>Rebecca </name> told me of the stealing, the said 
 <name>Hoar </name> would raise the devill to kill her, or bewitch her, or 
words to that effect. (but whether she said that  <name>Dorcas </name> her 
selfe or her chilldren told  <name>Rebecca </name> those words I remember 
not) I asked  <name>Rebecca </name> if she saw the book she said yea, she 
was shewed that book &amp; their were many streaks &amp; pictures in it by 
w'ch (as she was told) the said  <name>Hoar </name> could reveale secretes 
&amp; work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it was like 
a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you of the stealing 
 <name>Goody Hoar </name> will bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not 
to think so hardly of  <name>Goody Hoar. </name> But she replyed I know 
 <name>Goody Hoar </name> is a witch (or to the effect) &amp; then told 
storys of strange things that had been acted in or about my house, when I &amp; 
my wife were abroad to fright s'd  <name>Rebecca </name> into silence about 
the theft, w'ch s'd  <name>Rebecca </name> judged to be acts of s'd 
 <name>Hoars </name> witchcraft the particulars I have now forgotten. I 
called to minde that the s'd  <name>Hoar </name> had told me of a book of 
palmstry she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better 
satisfyed I asked  <name>Thomas Tuck </name> if he knew  <name>Goody 
Hoar </name> to have a book of fortune telling &amp; he said yea shee had, 
such a kind of book w'ch he had seen w'th streaks &amp; pictures in it and that 
it was about the bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like 
magnitude. this confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a 
book. And after my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her 
shee went in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not 
them w'ch can kill the boady &amp;c. </p> 
 <p>About those times other things were spoken of the s'd Hoares suspicians of 
her witchcraft whereupon a frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r 
Denison w'th them, for his consideration &amp; as I was informed Maj'r 
Denison took an opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his 
wife had &amp; W'm Hoar answered the book was John Samsons &amp; his 
wife had returned the 
 <pb n="399"> 
 
 
 
book long agoe &amp; so the matter was left for that time. When  
 <p>The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch 
agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of John Samsons w'ch 
he had from her as she said above 20 years agoe &amp; that shee had not told 
fortunes since the time I had layed before her the evill of it. w'ch is about 20 or 
22 years since. I lately spake w'th John Samson &amp; he told me that he had 
a book of Palmstry when he lived at Goody Hoars w'ch shee had seen: but that 
it was a book in quarto. &amp; he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since 
&amp; had not seen it since </p>

 <p>What sights did you see? </p> 
 <p>I have seen dogs and many creatures. </p>

 <p>And did you make a covenant with him? </p> 
 <p>Yes, I did, but I hope God will forgive me. </p>

 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>Wher? </p> 
 <p>At our house. </p>

 <p>Like a cat. </p> 
 <p>What would the cat have you do? </p> 
 <p>She had a book and would have me put my hand to it. </p> 
 <p>And did you? </p> 
 <p>No, I did not. </p> 
 <p>Well, tell the truth, did you at any other time? </p> 
 <p>Yes, I did, that time at the Eastward. </p> 
 <p>What other creatures did you see? </p> 
 <p>I saw things like men. </p>

 <p>No. </p> 
 <p>When you set your hand the last time to book, how long was that 
for? </p> 
 <p>It was for (4) years. </p> 
 <p>How long is that agoe? </p> 
 <p>It is almost 4 years. The book was brought to me to get my hand to it for 
4 years, but I never put my hand but that once at Eastward. </p> 
 <p>Are you not bid to hurt folks? </p> 
 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>Who are you bid to hurt? </p> 
 <p>Mercy Lewes and Ann Putman. </p>

 <p>I pinch't them. </p> 
 <p>How did you pinch them, do you goe in your own person to them? </p> 
 <p>No. </p> 
 <p>Doth the Devil go for you? </p> 
 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>And what doth he take, your spirit with him? </p> 
 <p>No. I am as well as at other times: but the Devil has my consent, and goes 
and hurts them. </p> 
 <p>Who hurt your mother last Lord's day, was it not you? </p> 
 <p>No. </p> 
 <p>Who was it? </p> 
 <p>I heard her say it was Goody Wilds at Topsfield. </p>

 <p>No, she would have me set my hand to her book also. </p> 
 <p>What mark did you make in the Devil's book when you set your hand to 
it? </p> 
 <p>I made a mark. </p> 
 <p>What mark? </p> 
 <p>Have you not been at other great meetings? </p> 
 <p>No. </p> 
 <p>Did you not hear of great hurt done here in the village? </p> 
 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>And were you never with them? </p> 
 <p>No, I was never with them. </p> 
 <p>But you know your shape appeared and hurt the people here. </p> 
 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>How did you know? </p> 
 <p>The Devil told me, if I gave consent, he would do it in my shape. </p> 
 <p>How long agoe? </p> 
 <p>About a fortnight agoe. </p> 
 <p>What shape did the Devil appear in then? </p> 
 <p>Like a black man with an hat. </p> 
 <p>Do not some creatures suck your body? </p> 
 <p>No. </p> 
 <p>Where do they come, to what parts, when they come to your body? </p> 
 <p>They do not come to my body, they come only in sight. </p> 
 <p>Do they speak to you? </p> 
 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>How do they speak to you? </p> 
 <p>As other folks. </p> 
 <p>What do they speak to you, as other folks? </p>

 </p> 
 <p>Because I am falsely accused.  --  Your worships all of you do you 
think this is true? </p> 
 <p>Nay, what do you think? </p> 
 <p>I never did it. </p> 
 <p>who did it? </p> 
 <p>Dont ask me. </p> 
 <p>Why should we not ask you? Sarah Churchwell accuseth you, there she 
is. </p> 
 <p>I am as innocent as the Child born to night, I have lived. 33. years here in 
Salem. </p> 
 <p>What then? </p> 
 <p>If you can prove that I am guilty, I will lye under it, Sarah </p> 
 <p>Churchwell said last night I was afflicted at Deacon Ingersolls, and Mary 
Walcot said it was a man with 2 staves, it was my master. </p> 
 <p>Pray do not accuse me, I am as clear as your worships; you must do right 
judgments. </p> 
 <p>What book did he bring you Sarah? </p> 
 <p>The same that the other woman brought. </p> 
 <p>The Devill can go in any shape. </p> 
 <p>Did he not [be] appear on the other side of the river and hurt you, did not 
you see him. </p> 
 <p>Yes he did. </p> 
 <p>Look there, she accuseth you to your face, she chargeth you that you hurt 
her twise. Is it not true? </p> 
 <p>What would you have me say? I never wronged no man in word nor 
deed. </p> 
 <p>Here are 3 evidences. </p> 
 <p>You tax me for a wizard, you may as well tax me for a buzard I have done 
no harm. </p> 
 <p>Is it no harm to afflict these? </p> 
 <p>I never did it. </p> 
 <p>But how comes it to be in your appearance? </p> 
 <p>The Devil can taken any likeness. </p> 
 <p>Not without their consent. </p> 
 <p>Please your worship it is untrue, I never showed the book, I am as silly 
about these things as the child born last night. </p> 
 <p>That is your Saying, you argue you have lived so long, but what then Cain 
might live long before he killed Abel, and you might live long before the Devill 
had so prevailed on you. </p> 
 <pb n="476"> 
 <p> 
 
 
 
 </p> 
 <p>Christ hath suffered 3 times for me. </p> 
 <p>What three times. </p> 
 <p>He suffered the Crosse &amp; gall  --  </p> 
 <p>You had as good confesse (said Sarah Churchwell) if you are guilty. </p> 
 <p>Have you heard that I have any witchcraft? </p> 
 <p>I know you lived a wicked life. </p> 
 <p>Let her make it out. </p> 
 <p>Doth he ever pray in his family? </p> 
 <p>Not unless by himself. </p> 
 <p>Why do you not pray in your family? </p> 
 <p>I cannot read. </p> 
 <p>Well but you may pray for all that. Can you say the Lords prayer? </p> 
 <p>Let us hear you? </p> 
 <p>He mist in severall parts of it, and could not repeat it right after Many 
Trialls </p> 
 <p>Sarah Churchwell, when you wrote in the book you was showed your 
masters name you said. </p> 
 <p>Yes Sir. </p> 
 <p>If she say so, if you do not know it, what will you say? </p> 
 <p>But she saw you, or your likeness tempt her to write. </p> 
 <p>one in my likeness, the Devil may present my likeness. </p> 
 <p>Were you not frighted Sarah Churchwell, when the representation of your 
master came to you? </p> 
 <p>Yes. </p> 
 <p>Well: burn me, or hang me, I will stand in the truth of Christ, I know 
nothing of it. </p> 
 <p>Do you know nothing of getting your son George and his daughter 
Margaret to signe? </p> 
 <p>No nothing at all. </p>

in. </p> 
 <p>Is this the man that hurts you? </p> 
 <p>Abig Williams cryed out this is the man and fell into a violent fit. </p> 
 <p>Ann Putman said this is the man, and he hurts her, and brings the book to 
her, and would have her write in the book, and she should be as well as his 
Grand daughter. </p> 
 <p>Mercy Lewis is this the man? </p>

 </p> 
 <p>This is the man (after much interruption by fits) he almost kills me. </p> 
 <p>Eliz: Hubbard said the man never hurt her till to day he came upon the 
Table. </p> 
 <p>Mary Walcot is this the man? </p> 
 <p>After much interruption by fits she said this is the man, he used to come 
with two staves and beat her with one of them. </p> 
 <p>What do you say, are you not a witch? </p> 
 <p>No I know it not, if I were to dye presently. </p> 
 <p>Mercy Lewes went to come near him but fell into great fits. </p> 
 <p>Mercy Lewes testimony read. What do you say to this? </p> 
 <p>Why it is false, I know not of it, any more than the child that was born to 
night. </p> 
 <p>Ann Putman said yes, you told me so, that you had been so this: 40 
years. </p> 
 <p>Ann Putman and Abigail Williams had each of them a pin stuck in their 
hands, and they said it was this old Jacobs. </p> 
 <p>Abigail Williams Testimony read. </p> 
 <p>Are not you the man that made disturbance at a Lecture in Salem. </p> 
 <p>No great disturbance. Do you think I use witchcraft? </p>

me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted 
Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized for

Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed several 
things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding of my own 
Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded Conscience 
who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on in my Sins, 
but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in any longer, but 
I was forced to confess the truth of all before the Magistrates, who would not 
believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in here, and God knows how soon I 
shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me beg your Prayers to the Lord on my 
behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy meeting in Heaven. My Mother poor

 <head>(Recantation of Margaret Jacobs) </head> 
 <p>The humble declaration of  <name>Margaret Jacobs </name> unto the 
honoured court now sitting at Salem, sheweth </p> 
 <p>That whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely confined here 
in Salem goal for the crime of witchcraft, which crime thanks be to the Lord I 
am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment: May it 
please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the possessed 
persons, as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination, which 
persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much startle and affright me. 
The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least measure, how or who 
afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else they would not fall 
down at me; they told me, if I would not confess, I should be put down into the 
dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should have my life; the 
which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart, to save my life; made 
me make the like confession I did, which confession, may it please the honoured 
court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night after I had made 
confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I could not sleep for fear the 
devil should carry me away for telling such horrid lies. I was, may it please the 
honoured court, sworn to my confession, as I understand since, but then, at that 
time, was ignorant of it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, 
in whom I trust, out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false 
forswearing myself. What I said, was altogether false against my grandfather, and 
Mr. Burroughs, which I did to save my life and to have my liberty; but the Lord, 
charging it to my conscience, made me in so much horror, that I could not 
contain myself before I had denied my confession, which I did though I saw 
nothing but death before 
 <pb n="492"> 
 
 
 
me, chusing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live in such horror, 
which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my confession, I was 
committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more felicity in spirit, a 
thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement. </p> 
 <p>And now, may it please your honours, your declarant, having, in part, 
given your honours a description of my condition, do leave it to your honours 
pious and judicious discretions, to take pity and compassion on my young and 
tender years, to act and do with me, as the Lord above and your honours shall 
see good, having no friend, but the Lord, to plead my cause for me; not being 
guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft, nor any other sin that 
deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant shall for ever 
pray, as she is bound in duty, for your honours happiness in this life and eternal 
felicity in the world to come. So prays your honours declarant. </p>

 <p>Showeth that whereas  <name>Rebecah Jacobs </name> (daughter of

 <p>Your Petitioner who knows well the Condition of her poor Daughter,

 <p>However for (I think) about this half Year the s'd Jacobs has lyen in Priso

 <p>Christianity &amp; Nature do each of them oblige Your Petitioner to be

 <p>She is uncapable of making that shift for her self that others can do, &amp;

Lacey, Jr., Second Version) </head> 
 <p> <date n=1692-07-21>21st July, 1692. </date> Before  <name>Major 
Gidney, Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Corwin and Capt. Higginson. </name> </p> 
 <p>Q. Goody Foster! you remember we have three times spoken with you, and 
do you now remember what you then confessed to us?  --  You have been 
engaged in very great wickedness, and some have been left to hardness of heart 
to deny; but it seems that God will give you more favour than others, inasmuch 
as you relent. But your daughter here hath confessed some things that you did not 
tell us of. Your daughter was with you and Goody Carrier, when you did ride 
upon the stick. A. I did not know it. Q. How long have you known your daughter 
to be engaged? A. I cannot tell, nor have I any knowledge of it at all. Q. Did you 
see your daughter at the meeting? A. No. Q. Your daughter said she was at the 
witches meeting, and that you yourself stood at a distance off and did not partake 
at that meeting; and you said so also; give us a relation from the beginning until 
now. A. I know none of their names that were there, but only Goody Carrier. Q. 
Would you know their faces if you saw them? A. I cannot tell. Q. Where there 
not two companies in the field at the same time? A. I remember no more. 
 --  Mary Warren, one of the afflicted, said that Goody Carrier's shape told 
her, that Goody Foster had made her daughter a witch.  --  Q. Do not you 
acknowledge that you did so about 13 years ago? A. No, and I know no more of 
my daughter's being a witch than what day I shall die upon. Q. Are you willing 
your daughter should make a full and free confession? A. Yes. Q. Are you 
willing to do so too? A. Yes. Q. You cannot expect peace of conscience without 
a free confession. A. If I knew any thing more, I would speak it to the utmost. 
 --  Goody Lacey, the daughter, called in, began thus; Oh! mother! how do 
you do? We have left Christ, and the devil hath gat hold of us. How shall I get 
rid of this evil one? I desire God to break my rocky heart that I may get the 
victory this time. Q. Goody Foster! you cannot get rid of this snare, your heart 
and mouth is not open. A. I did not see the devil, I was praying to the Lord. Q. 
What Lord? A. To God. Q. What God do witches pray to? A. I cannot tell, the 
Lord help me. Q. Goody Lacey! had you no discourse with your mother when 
riding? A. No, I think I had not a word. Q. Who rid foremost on that stick to the 
village? A. I suppose 
 <pb n="532"> 
 
 
 
my mother.  --  Goody Foster said, that Goody Carrier was foremost 
 --  Q. Goody Lacey! how many years ago since they were baptized? A. 
Three or four years ago, I suppose. Q. Who baptized them? A. The old serpent. 
Q. How did he do it? A. He dipped their heads in the water, saying, they were 
his and that he had power over them. Q. Where was this? A. At Fall's river. Q. 
How many were baptized that day? A. Some of the chief; I think they were six 
baptized. Q. Name them. A. I think they were of the higher powers.  --  
Mary Lacey, the grand-daughter, was brought in, and Mary Warren fell into a 
violent fit. Q. How dare you come in here, and bring the devil with you to afflict 
these poor creatures?  --  Lacey laid her hand on Warren's arm, and she 
recovered from her fit.  --  Q. You are here accused of practising witchcraft 
upon Goody Ballard; which way do you do it? A. I cannot tell. Where is my 
mother that made me a witch, and I knew it not? Q. Can you look upon that maid 
Mary Warren, and not hurt her? Look upon her in a friendly way. -- She, trying 
so to do, struck her down with her eyes. Q. Do you acknowledge now you are 
a witch? A. Yes. Q. How long have you been a witch? A. Not above a week. Q. 
Did the devil appear to you? A. Yes. Q. In what shape? A. In the shape of a 
horse. Q. What did he say to you? A. He bid me not to be afraid of any thing, 
and he would not bring me out, but he has proved a liar from the beginning. Q. 
When was this? A. I know not; above a week. Q. Did you set your hand to the 
book? A. No. Q. Did he bid you worship him? A. Yes, he bid me also afflict 
persons.  --  You are now in the way to obtain mercy if you will confess 
and repent. She said, the Lord help me. Q. Do not you desire to be saved by 
Christ? A. Yes.  --  Then you must confess freely what you know in this 
matter. She then proceeded.  --  I was in bed and the devil came to me and 
bid me obey him and I should want for nothing, and he would not bring me out. 
Q. But how long ago? A. A Little more than a year. Q. Was that the first time? 
A. Yes. Q. How long was you gone from your father, when you ran away? A. 
Two days. Q. Where had you your food? A. At John Stone's. Q. Did the Devil 
appear to you then, when you was abroad? A. No, but he put such thoughts in 
my mind as not to obey my parents. Q. Who did the devil bid you afflict? A. 
Timothy Swan. Richard Carrier comes often a nights and has me to afflict 
persons. Q. Where do ye go? A. To Goody Ballard's sometimes. Q. How many 
of you were there at a time? A. Richard Carrier and his mother, and my mother 
and grandmother. 
 <pb n="533"> 
 
 
 
 --  Uponeading over the confession so far, Goody Lacey, the mother, 
owned this last particular. Q. How many more witches are there in Andover? A. 
I know no more, but Richard Carrier. </p>

 <p>Mr. Harthorn. What do you say (speaking to one afflicted) have you seen 
this Woman hurt you? </p> 
 <p>Yes, she beat me this morning </p> 
 <p>Abigial. Have you been hurt by this Woman? </p> 
 <p>Yes </p> 
 <p>Ann Putman in a grievous fit cryed out that she hurt her. </p> 
 <p>Goody Nurse, here are two An: Putman the child &amp; Abigail Williams 
complains of your hurting them What do you say to it </p> 
 <p>N. I can say before my Eternal father I am innocent, &amp; God will clear 
my innocency </p> 
 <p>Here is never a one in the Assembly but desires it, but if you be guilty Pray 
God discover you. </p> 
 <p>Then Hen: Kenny rose up to speak </p> 
 <p>Goodm: Kenny what do you say </p> 
 <p>Then he entered his complaint &amp; farther said that since this Nurse 
came into the house he was seizd twise with an amaz'd condition </p> 
 <p>Here are not only these but, here is the wife of Mr Tho: Putman who 
accuseth you by credible information &amp; that both of tempting her to iniquity, 
&amp; of greatly hurting her. </p> 
 <p>N. I am innocent &amp; clear &amp; have not been able to get out of 
doors these 8. or 9. dayes. </p> 
 <p>Mr Putman: give in what you have to say </p> 
 <p>Then Mr Edward Putman gave in his relate </p> 
 <p>Is this true Goody Nurse </p> 
 <p>I never afflicted no child never in my life </p> 
 <pb n="585"> 
 <p> 
 
 
 
 </p> 
 <p>You see these accuse you, is it true </p> 
 <p>No. </p> 
 <p>Are you an innocent person relating to this Witchcraft. </p> 
 <p>Here Tho: Putmans wife cryed out, Did you not bring the Black man with 
you, did you not bid me tempt God &amp; dye How oft have you eat and drunk 
y'r own damaon What do you say to them </p> 
 <p>Oh Lord help me, &amp; spread out her hands, &amp; the afflicted were 
greviously vexed </p> 
 <p>Do you not see what a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are 
loose the pesons are afflicted. </p> 
 <p>Then Mary Walcot (who often heretofore said she had seen her, but never 
could say or did say that she either bit or pincht her, or hurt her) &amp; also 
Eliz: Hubbard under the like circumstances both openly accused her of hurting 
them </p> 
 <p>Here are these 2 grown persons now accuse you, w't say you? Do not you 
see these afflicted persons, &amp; hear them accuse you. </p> 
 <p>The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am an innocent person </p> 
 <p>It is very awfull to all to see these agonies &amp; you an old Professor thus 
charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it &amp; yet to see 
you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet  --  </p> 
 <p>You do not know my heart </p> 
 <p>You would do well if you are guilty to confess &amp; give Glory to 
God </p> 
 <p>I am as clear as the child unborn </p> 
 <p>What uncertainty there may be in apparitions I know not, yet this with me 
strikes hard upon you that you are at this very present charged with familiar 
spirits: this is your bodily person they speak to: they say now they see these 
familiar spirits com to your bodily #[spirits com to your bodily] person, now 
what do you say to that </p> 
 <p>I have none Sir: </p> 
 <p>If you have confess &amp; give glory to God I pray God clear you if you 
be innocent, &amp; if you are guilty discover you And therefore give me an 
upright answer: have you any familiarity with these spirits? </p> 
 <p>No, I have none but with God alone. </p> 
 <p>How came you sick for there is an odd discourse of that in the mouths of 
many  --  </p> 
 <p>I am sick at my stumach  --  </p> 
 <p>Have you no wounds </p> 
 <pb n="586"> 
 <p> 
 
 
 
 </p> 
 <p>I have none but old age </p> 
 <p>You do Know whither you are guilty, &amp; have familiarity with the 
Devil, &amp; now when you are here present to see such a thing as these testify 
a black man whispering in your ear, &amp; birds about you what do you say to 
it </p> 
 <p>It is all false I am clear </p> 
 <p>Possibly you may apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led 
aside by temptations that way </p> 
 <p>I have not </p> 
 <p>What a sad thing it is that a church member here &amp; now an other of 
Salem, should be thus accused and charged </p> 
 <p>Mrs Pope fell into a grevious fit, &amp; cryed out a sad thing sure enough: 
And then many more fell into lamentable fits. </p> 
 <p>Tell us have not you had visible appearances more than what is common 
in nature? </p> 
 <p>I have noe nor never had in my life </p> 
 <p>Do you think these suffer voluntary or involuntary </p> 
 <p>I cannot tell </p> 
 <p>That is strange every one can judge </p> 
 <p>I must be silent </p> 
 <p>They accuse you of hurting them, &amp; if you think it is not unwillingly 
but by designe, you must look upon them as murderers </p> 
 <p>I cannot tell what to think of it </p> 
 <p>Afterwards when this was som what insisted on she said I do not think so: 
she did not understand aright what was said </p> 
 <p>Well then give an answer now, do you think these suffer against their wills 
or not </p> 
 <p>I do not think these suffer against their wills </p> 
 <p>Why did you never visit these afflicted persons </p> 
 <p>Because I was afraid I should have fits too </p> 
 <p>Note Upon the motion of her body fitts followed upon the complainants 
abundantly &amp; very frequently </p> 
 <p>Is it not an unaccountable case that when you are examined these persons 
are afflicted? </p> 
 <p>I have got no body to look to but God </p> 
 <p>Again upon stirring her hands the afflicted persons were seized with violent 
fits of torture </p> 
 <p>Do you beleive these afflicted persons are bewitcht </p>

 <p>When this Witchcraft came upon the stage there was no suspicion of Tituba 
(Mr Paris's Indian woman) she profest much love to that child Betty Paris, but 
it was her apparition did the mischief, &amp; why should not you also be guilty, 
for your apparition doth hurt also. </p> 
 <p>Would you have me bely my self  --  </p> 
 <p>she held her Neck on one side, &amp; accordingly so were the afflicted 
taken </p> 
 <p>Then Authority requiring it Sam: Paris read what he had in characters taken

 <p>I cannot help it, the Devil may appear in my shape. </p>

 <p>When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object 
against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which the 
Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply to 
Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter, who had been faulty in setting their hands to 
the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the words were &ldquo;What, 
do these persons give in Evidence against me now, they used to come among 
us.&rdquo; After the honoured Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the 
 <pb n="608"> 
 
 
 
Verdict, several of the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and 
thereupon the honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the 
Case, I could not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she 
had a further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and 
then going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the 
Court were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar, but 
made no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a 
principal Evidence against her. </p>

 <head>(Examination of Mary Osgood) </head> 
 <p>The examination and confession  <date n=1692-09-08>(8. Sept. 
92.) </date> of  <name>Mary Osgood </name>, wife of Captain 
 <name>Osgood </name> of Andover, taken before  <name>John 
Hawthorne </name> and other their Majesties justices. </p> 
 <p>She confesses, that about 11 years ago, when she was in a melancholy state 
and condition, she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain time, 
she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of the house, which yet she thought 
was a real cat. However, at that time, it diverted her from praying to God, and 
instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which time she made a covenant 
with the devil, who, as a black man, came to her and presented her a book, upon 
which she laid her finger and that left a red spot: And that upon her signing, the 
devil told her he was her God, and that she should serve and worship him, and, 
she believes, she consented to it. She says further, that about two years agone, 
she was carried through the air, in company with deacon Frye's wife, Ebenezer 
Baker's wife, and Goody Tyler, to five mile pond, where she was baptized by the 
devil, who dipped her face in the water and made her renounce her former 
baptism, and told her she must be his, soul and body, forever, and that she must 
serve him, which she promised to do. She says, the renouncing her first baptism 
was after her dipping, and that she was transported back again through the air, 
in company with the forenamed persons, in the same manner as she went, and 
believes they were carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the 
pole? A. As I said before, viz. four persons and no more but whom she had 
named above.  --  She confesses she has afflicted three persons, John 
Sawdy, Martha Sprague and Rose Foster, and that she did it by pinching her bed 
clothes, and giving consent the devil should do it in her shape, and that the devil 
could not do it without her consent.  --  She confesses the afflicting persons 
in the court, by the glance of her eye. She says, as she was coming down to 
Salem to be 
 <pb n="616"> 
 
 
 
examined, she and the rest of the company with her, stopped at Mr. Phillips's to 
refresh themselves, and the afflicted persons, being behind them upon the road, 
came up just as she was mounting again and were then afflicted, and cried out 
upon her, so that she was forced to stay until they were all past, and said she 
only looked that way towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape 
of an innocent person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this 
way of witchcraft? A. Satan, and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction 
and quietness in her future state, but never performed any thing; and that she has 
lived more miserably and more discontented since, than ever before. She 
confesses further, that she herself, in company with Goody Parker, Goody Tyler, 
and Goody Dean, had a meeting at Moses Tyler's house, last monday night, to 
afflict, and that she and Goody Dean carried the shape of Mr. Dean, the minister, 
between them, to make persons believe that Mr. Dean afflicted. Q. What 
hindered you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not 
suffer it so to be, that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. 
Have you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof, as I shall 
answer in the presence of God and his people; but said, that the black man stood 
before her, and told her, that what she had confessed was a lie; notwithstanding, 
she said that what she had confessed was true, and thereto put her hand. Her 
husband being present was asked, if he judged his wife to be any way 
discomposed. He answered, that having lived with her so long, he doth not judge 
her to be any ways discomposed, but has cause to believe what she has said is 
true.  --  When Mistress Osgood was first called, she afflicted Martha 
Sprague and Rose Foster, by the glance of her eyes, and recovered them out of 
their fits by the touch of her hand. Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson and Hannah 
Post saw Mistress Osgood afflicting Sprague and Foster.  --  The said 
Hannah Post and Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson, jun. and Rose Foster and Mary 
Richardson were afflicted by Mistress Osgood, in the time of their examination, 
and recovered by her touching of their hands. </p> 
 <p>I underwritten, being appointed by authority, to take this examination, do 
testify upon oath, taken in court, that this is a true copy of the substance of it, to 
the best of my knowledge,

 <head>(Rev. Increase Mather's Report of his Conversation in 
Prison with Mary Osgood) </head> 
 <p>Being asked why she prefixed a time, and spake of her being baptized, 
&amp;c., about twelve years since, she replied and said, that, when she had 
owned the thing, they asked the time, to which she answered that she knew not 
the time. But, being told that she did know the time, and must tell the time, and 
the like, she considered that about twelve years before (when she had her last 
child) she had a fit of sickness, and was melancholy; and so thought that that time 
might be as proper a time to mention as any, and accordingly did prefix the said 
time. Being asked about the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed that the 
Devil had appeared to her, &amp;c., she replied, that, being told that the Devil 
had appeared to her, and must needs appear to her, &amp;c. (she being a witch), 
she at length did own that the Devil had appeared to her; and, being pressed to 
say in what creature's shape he appeared, she at length did say that it was in the 
shape of a cat. Remembering that, some time before her being apprehended, as 
she went out at her door, she saw a cat, &amp;c.; not as though she any whit 
suspected the said cat to be the Devil, in the day of it, but because some creature 
she must mention, and this came into her mind at that time. </p>

 <p>We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been 
long under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that 
great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it our duty 
to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them will avail. The 
persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to speak something at 
present are  <name>Mrs. Mary Osgood, Eunice Frye, Deliverance Dane, Sarah 
Wilson and Abigail Barker, </name> who are women of whom we can truly 
give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us so 
inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to suspect 
them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary conversation have 
obtained a good report in the place, where they have been well esteemed and 
approved in the church of which they are members. </p> 
 <p>We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were 
accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent were 
liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were accused by 
some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and others, tho' they 
had so good grounds of charity that they should not have thought any evil of 
them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of that evidence that was so 
much credited and improved against people, took great pains to persuade them to 
own what they were, by the afflicted, charged with, and, indeed, did 
unreasonably urge them to confess themselves guilty, as some of us who were 
then present can testify. But these good women did very much assert their 
innocency, yet some of them said they were not without fear least Satan had some 
way ensnared them, because there was that evidence against them which then was 
by many thought to be a certain indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they 
seriously professed they knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, 
by the unwearied sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both 
 <pb n="619"> 
 
 
 
at home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they 
were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and believe 
they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event might be, and 
the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that confessing was the 
only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a temptation for timorous 
women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction that we have heard they were 
then in. Had what they said against themselves proceeded from conviction of the 
fact, we should have had nothing to have said for them, but we are induced to 
think that it did not, because they did soon privately retract what they had said, 
as we are informed, and, while they were in prison, they declared to such as they 
had confidence to speak freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what 
they had owned, and that what they had said against themselves was the greatest 
grief and burden they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing 
very sinful for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, 
considering the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among 
us, and what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, 
we cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that hath 
been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under the like 
circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of them that 
while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such persons as, 
of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do we know that any 
of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of that evil that they are 
now charged with. </p>

 <p>the humble Petition of  <name>John Parker, &amp; Joseph 
Parker </name> of Andover sheweth, </p> 
 <p>That whereas our mother mary Parker of Andover, was apprehended upon 
suspition of witchcraft, and being brought to a tryall at Salem Court, was 
condemned: since her death the sherriff of Essex sent an officer to seise on her 
estate. The said officer required us in their majestyes name to give him an 
Account of our mothers estate, pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told 
him that our mother left no estate; (which we are able to make appear) 
notwithstanding which, he seised upon our cattell, Corn &amp; hay, to a 
considerable value; and ordered us to go down to Salem and make an agreement 
with the sherrife, otherwise the estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing 
what advantage the Law might give him against us, and fearing we should sustain 
greater Damage by the loss of our Estate, went to the sherriff accordingly, who 
told us he might take away all that was seised. if he pleased, but was willing to 
do us a kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded 
ten pounds of us, but at length was willing to take Six pounds, which he has 
 <pb n="637"> 
 
 
 
obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our Mother had left any 
Estate, we know not of any Law in force in this Province, by which it should be 
forfeited upon her condemnation; much less can we understand that there is any 
Justice or reason, for the sherriff to seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our 
own act has obliged us to pay him a Summ of money, yet we declare that we 
were drawn to it partly by the officers great pretences of Law for what he did, 
partly to prevent the loss of our estate which we feard would be immediately 
sold. </p> 
 <p>How we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case, and if it be 
judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us, upon the 
forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that obligation, 
which the sherriff, taking advantage of our ignorance hath brough us under And 
yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray &amp;c  --  </p>

Goody Procter first, and then Goody Cloyse. Q. What did she do to you? A. she 
brought the book to me. Q. John! tell the truth, who hurts you? have you been 
hurt? A. The first, was a gentlewoman I saw. Q. Who next? A. Goody Cloyse. 
Q. But who hurt you next? A. Goody Procter. Q. What did she do to you? A. 
She choaked me, and brought the book. Q. How oft did she come to torment 
you? A. A good many times, she and Goody Cloyse. Q. Do they come to you in 
the night as well as the day? A. They come most in the day. Q. Who? A. Goody 
Cloyse and Goody Procter. Q. Where did she take hold of you? A. Upon my 
throat, to stop my breath. Q. Do you know Goody Cloyse and Goody Proctor? 
A. Yes, here is Goody Cloyse. (Cloyse) when did I hurt thee? A. A great many 
times. (Cloyse) Oh! you are a grievous liar. Q. What did this Goody Cloyse do 
to you? A. She pinched and bit me till the blood came. Q. How long since this 
woman came and hurt you? A. Yesterday at meeting. Q. At any time before? A. 
Yes a great many times. Q. Mary Walcot! who hurts you? A. Goody Cloyse. Q. 
What did she do to you? A. She hurt me. Q. Did she bring the book? A. Yes. Q. 
What was you to do with it? A. To touch it, and be well.  --  Then she fell 
into a fit. Q. Doth she come alone? A. Sometimes alone, and sometimes in 
company with Goody Nurse and Goody Corey, and a great many I do not know. 
 --  Then she fell into a fit again.  --  Q. Abigail Williams! did you 
see a company at Mr. Parris's house eat and drink? A. Yes Sir, that was their 
sacrament. Q. How many were there? A. About forty, and Goody Cloyse and 
Goody Good were their deacons. Q. What was it? A. They said it was our blood, 
and they had it twice that day. Q. Mary Walcot! have you seen a white man? 
Yes, Sir, a great many times. Q. What sort of man was he? A. A fine grave man, 
and when he came, he made all the witches to tremble.  --  Abigail 
Williams confirmed the same, and that they had such a sight at Deacon 
Ingersoll's. Q. Who was at Deacon Ingersoll's then? A. Goody Cloyse, Goody 
Nurse, Goody Corey, and Goody Good.  --  Then Sarah Cloyse asked for 
water, and sat down as one seized with a dying fainting fit; and several of the 
afflicted fell into fits, and some of them cried out, Oh! her spirit is gone to prison 
to her sister Nurse.  --  Q. Elizabeth Procter! you understand whereof you 
are charged, viz. to be guilty of sundry acts of witchcraft; what say you to it? 
Speak the truth, and so you that are afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you 
will answer it before God another day. Mary Walcot! doth this woman hurt you? 
A. I never saw her so as to be hurt by her. Q. Mary Lewis! does she hurt you? 
 --  Her mouth was 
 <pb n="660"> 
 
 
 
stopped.  --  Q. Ann Putman, does she hurt you?  --  She could not 
speak.  --  Q. Abigail Williams! does she hurt you?  --  Her hand was 
thrust in her own mouth.  --  Q. John! does she hurt you? A. This is the 
woman that came in her shift and choaked me. Q. did she ever bring the book? 
A. Yes, Sir. Q. What to do? A. to write. Q. What, this woman? A. Yes, Sir. Q. 
Are you sure of it? A. Yes, Sir.  --  Again, Abigail Williams and Ann 
Putman were spoke to by the court, but neither of them could make any answer, 
by reason of dumbness or other fits. Q. What do you say Goody Procter to these 
things? A. I take God in heaven to be my witness, that I know nothing of it, no 
more than the child unborn. Q. Ann Putman! doth this woman hurt you. A. Yes 
Sir, a great many times.  --  Then the accused looked upon them and they 
fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A. Yes, Sir, 
often, and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it. Q. Abigail Williams! 
does this woman hurt you? A. Yes, Sir, often. Q. Does she bring the book to 
you? A. Yes. Q. What would she have you do with it? A. To write in it and I 
shall be well.  --  Did not you, said Abigal, tell me, that your maid had 
written? (Procter) Dear Child, it is not so. There is another judgement, dear 
child.  --  Then Abigail and Ann had fits.  --  By and by they cried 
out, look you there is Goody Procter upon the beam.  --  By and by, both 
of them cried out of Goodman Procter himself, and said he was a wizard. 
 --  Immediately, many, if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. 
 --  Q. Ann Putman! who hurt you? A. Goodman Procter and his wife too. 
 --  Afterwards some of the afflicted cried, there is Procter going to take up 
Mrs. Pope's feet.  --  And her feet were immediately taken up.  --  
Q. What do you say Goodman Proctor to these things? A. I know not, I am 
innocent.  --  Abigail Williams cried out, there is Goodman Procter going 
to Mrs. Pope, and immediately, said Pope fell into a fit.  --  You see the 
devil will deceive you; the children could see what you was going to do before 
the woman was hurt. I would advise you to repentance, for the devil is bringing 
you out.  --  Abigail Williams cried out again, there is Goodman Procter 
going to hurt Goody Bibber; and immediately Goody Bibber fell into a fit. There 
was the like of Mary Walcot, and divers others.  --  Benjamin Gould gave 
in his testimony, that he had seen Goodman Corey and his wife, Procter and his 
wife, Goody Cloyse, Goody Nurse, and Goody Griggs in his chamber last 
thursday night.  --  Elizabeth Hubbard was in a trance during the whole 
examination.  --  During the examination of Elizabeth Procter, Abigail 
Williams and Ann Putman, 
 <pb n="661"> 
 
 
 
both made offer to strike at said Procter; but when Abigail's hand came near, it 
opened, whereas it was made up into a fist before, and came done exceeding 
lightly, as it drew near to said Procter, and at length with open and extended 
fingers, touched Procter's hood very lightly. Immediately Abigail cried out, her 
fingers, her fingers, burned, and Ann Putman took on most greviously, of her 
head, and sunk down. </p> 
 <p>Salem, April 11th, 1692. Mr. Samuel Parris was desired by the honourable 
Thomas Danforth, deputy-governor, and the council, to take in writing the 
aforesaid examinations, and accordingly took and delivered them in; and upon

 <p>Too the Hon'rable Court of Assistants now Sitting In Boston.

 <p>Hon'red &amp; Right Worshipfull! </p> 
 <p>The foresd John Procter may have Great Reason to Justifie the Divine 
Sovereigntie of God under thos Severe Remarques of Providence upon his Peac 
&amp; Hon'r und'r a due Reflection upon his Life Past: And so the Best of us 
have Reason to Adoar the Great Pittie &amp; Indulgenc of Gods Providenc, that 
we are not Exposed to the utmost shame, that the Divell can Invent und'r the 
p'rmissions of Sovereigntie, tho not for that Sin fore Named; yet for o'r many 
Transgretions; for we Do at present Suppose that it may be A Method w'thin the 
Seveerer But Just Transaction of the Infinite Majestie of God: that he some times 
may p'rmitt Sathan to p'rsonate, Dissemble, &amp; therby abuse Inocents, 
&amp; such as Do in the fear of God Defie the Devill and all his works. The 
Great Rage he is p'rmitted to attempt holy Job w'th The Abuse he Does the

they have been w'thin our acquaintance; Neither doe we remember  --  any 
such Thoughts in us Concerning them; or any Action by them or either of them 
Directly tending that way; no more than might be in the lives of any other p'rsons 
of the Clearest Reputation as to Any such Evills. What God may have Left them

 <p>The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our 
Judges, and Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, 
having Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and 
engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your 
Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it 
be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will 
be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates, Ministers, 
Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and incensed 
against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason 
we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent Persons. Here are five 
Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some 
of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament, since we were committed into 
close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons) 
Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels 
till the Blood was ready to come out of their Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and 
reported this was the occasion of making them confess that they never did, by 
reason they said one had been a 
 <pb n="690"> 
 
 
 
Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their Mother had made them 
so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son William Procter, when 
he was examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was 
Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his Nose, 
and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the rest, had 
not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions are very like 
the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates, and that will 
not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods. If it cannot be granted that we 
can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavour to have 
these Magistrates changed, and others in their rooms, begging also and 
beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if not all, some of you at our Trials, 
hoping thereby you may be the means of saving the sheeding our Innocent 
Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest your Poor 
Afflicted Servants, </p>
