<p>THIS work was originally constructed, and in previous   
editions appeared, in the form of Lectures.   
The only vestiges of that form, in its present shape,   
are certain modes of expression. The language retains   
the character of an address by a speaker to his hearers; being more familiar, direct, and personal than is   
ordinarily employed in the relations of an author to   
a reader.</p>   
<p>The former work was prepared under circumstances   
which prevented a thorough investigation of the subject. Leisure and freedom from professional duties   
have now enabled me to prosecute the researches   
necessary to do justice to it.</p>   
<p>The &ldquo;Lectures on Witchcraft,&rdquo; published in 1831,   
have long been out of print. Although frequently   
importuned to prepare a new edition, I was unwilling   
to issue again what I had discovered to be an insufficient presentation of the subject. In the mean time,   
<pb n="viii"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1009">   
<figDesc>Page viii.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
it constantly became more and more apparent, that   
much injury was resulting from the want of a complete and correct view of a transaction so often referred to, and universally misunderstood.</p>   
<p>The first volume of this work contains what seems   
to me necessary to prepare the reader for the second,   
in which the incidents and circumstances connected   
with the witchcraft prosecutions in 1692, at the village   
and in the town of Salem, are reduced to chronological   
order, and exhibited in detail.</p>   
<p>As showing how far the beliefs of the understanding, the perceptions of the senses, and the delusions   
of the imagination, may be confounded, the subject   
belongs not only to theology and moral and political   
science, but to physiology, in its original and proper   
use, as embracing our whole nature; and the facts   
presented may help to conclusions relating to what is   
justly regarded as the great mystery of our being, &mdash;   
the connection between the body and the mind.</p>   
<p>It is unnecessary to mention the various well-known   
works of authority and illustration, as they are referred to in the text. But I cannot refrain from bearing   
my grateful testimony to the value of the &ldquo;Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society&rdquo; and the   
&ldquo;New-England Historical and Genealogical Register.&rdquo;   
The &ldquo;Historical Collections&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Proceedings&rdquo; of   
the Essex Institute have afforded me inestimable assistance. Such works as these are providing the materials   
<pb n="ix"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1010">   
<figDesc>Page ix.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that will secure to our country a history such as no   
other nation can have. Our first age will not be   
shrouded in darkness and consigned to fable, but, in   
all its details, brought within the realm of knowledge.   
Every person who desires to preserve the memory of   
his ancestors, and appreciate the elements of our institutions and civilization, ought to place these works,   
and others like them, on the shelves of his library, in   
an unbroken and continuing series. A debt of gratitude is due to the earnest, laborious, and disinterested   
students who are contributing the results of their   
explorations to the treasures of antiquarian and genealogical learning which accumulate in these publications.</p>   
<p>A source of investigation, especially indispensable   
in the preparation of the present work, deserves to   
be particularly noticed. In 1647, the General Court   
of Massachusetts provided by law for the taking of   
testimony, in all cases, under certain regulations, in   
the form of depositions, to be preserved <foreign lang="unknown" rend="italics">in perpetuam   
rei memoriam.</foreign> The evidence of witnesses was prepared   
in writing, beforehand, to be used at the trials; they   
to be present at the time, to meet further inquiry, if   
living within ten miles, and not unavoidably prevented.   
In a capital case, the presence of the witness, as well   
as his written testimony, was absolutely required.   
These depositions were lodged in the files, and constitute the most valuable materials of history. In our   
<pb n="x"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1011">   
<figDesc>Page x.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
day, the statements of witnesses ordinarily live only   
in the memory of persons present at the trials, and   
are soon lost in oblivion. In cases attracting unusual   
interest, stenographers are employed to furnish them   
to the press. There were no newspaper reporters or   
&ldquo;court calendars&rdquo; in the early colonial times; but   
these depositions more than supply their place. Given   
in, as they were, in all sorts of cases, &mdash; of wills, contracts, boundaries and encroachments, assault and battery, slander, larceny, &amp;c., they let us into the interior,   
the very inmost recesses, of life and society in all their   
forms. The extent to which, by the aid of <hi rend="smallcaps">William   
P. Upham,</hi> Esq., of Salem, I have drawn from this   
source is apparent at every page.</p>   
<p>A word is necessary to be said relating to the originals of the documents that belong to the witchcraft   
proceedings. They were probably all deposited at the   
time in the clerk's office of Essex County. A considerable number of them were, from some cause,   
transferred to the State archives, and have been carefully preserved. Of the residue, a very large proportion   
have been abstracted from time to time by unauthorized   
hands, and many, it is feared, destroyed or otherwise   
lost. Two very valuable parcels have found their way   
into the libraries of the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Essex Institute, where they are faithfully   
secured. A few others have come to light among   
papers in the possession of individuals. It is to be   
<pb n="xi"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1012">   
<figDesc>Page xi.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
hoped, that, if any more should be found, they will be   
lodged in some public institution; so that, if thought   
best, they may all be collected, arranged, and placed   
beyond wear, tear, and loss, in the perpetual custody   
of type.</p>   
<p>The papers remaining in the office of the clerk of   
this county were transcribed into a volume a few years   
since; the copyist supplying, conjecturally, headings   
to the several documents. Although he executed his   
work in an elegant manner, and succeeded in giving   
correctly many documents hard to be deciphered, such   
errors, owing to the condition of the papers, occurred   
in arranging them, transcribing their contents, and   
framing their headings, that I have had to resort to   
the originals throughout.</p>   
<p>As the object of this work is to give to the reader of   
the present day an intelligible view of a transaction   
of the past, and not to illustrate any thing else than   
the said transaction, no attempt has been made to preserve the orthography of that period. Most of the   
original papers were written without any expectation   
that they would ever be submitted to inspection in   
print; many of them by plain country people, without   
skill in the structure of sentences, or regard to spelling; which, in truth, was then quite unsettled. It is   
no uncommon thing to find the same word spelled   
differently in the same document. It is very questionable whether it is expedient or just to perpetuate   
<pb n="xii"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1013">   
<figDesc>Page xii.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
blemishes, often the result of haste or carelessness,   
arising from mere inadvertence. In some instances,   
where the interest of the passage seemed to require it,   
the antique style is preserved. In no case is a word   
changed or the structure altered; but the now received   
spelling is generally adopted, and the punctuation   
made to express the original sense.</p>   
<p>It is indeed necessary, in what claims to be an exact   
reprint of an old work, to imitate its orthography precisely, even at the expense of difficulty in apprehending at once the meaning, and of perpetuating errors   
of carelessness and ignorance. Such modern reproductions are valuable, and have an interest of their   
own. They deserve the favor of all who desire to   
examine critically, and in the most authentic form,   
publications of which the original copies are rare, and   
the earliest editions exhausted. The enlightened and   
enterprising publishers who are thus providing facsimiles of old books and important documents of past   
ages ought to be encouraged and rewarded by a generous public. But the present work does not belong to   
that class, or make any pretensions of that kind.</p>   
<p>My thanks are especially due to the Hon. <hi rend="smallcaps">Asahel

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> map, based upon various local maps and the CoastSurvey chart, is the result of much personal exploration   
and perambulation of the ground. It may claim to be a   
very exact representation of many of the original grants and   
farms. The locality of the houses, mills, and bridges, in   
1692, is given in some cases precisely, and in all with near   
approximation. The task has been a difficult one. An   
original plot of Governor Endicott's Ipswich River grant, No.   
III., is in the State House, and one of the Swinnerton grant,   
No. XIX., in the Salem town-books. Neither of them,   
however, affords elements by which to establish its exact   
location. A plot of the Townsend Bishop grant, No. XX.,   
as its boundaries were finally determined, is in the State   
House, and another of the same in the court-files of the   
county. This gives one fixed and known point, Hadlock's   
Bridge, from which, following the lines by points of compass   
and distances, as indicated on the plot and described in the   
Colonial Records, all the sides of the grant are laid out with   
accuracy, and its place on the map determined with absolute   
certainty. A very perfect and scientifically executed plan

1666 is in the State House; of which an exact tracing was   
kindly furnished by Mr. H. J. <hi rend="smallcaps">Coolidge,</hi> of the Secretary of   
State's office. It gives two of the sides of the Governor   
Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner as to afford   
the means of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing   
its locality. There are no other plots of original or early   
grants or farms on this territory; but, starting from the   
Bishop and Bellingham grants thus laid out in their respective places, by a collation of deeds of conveyance and partition on record, with the aid of portions of the primitive   
stone-walls still remaining, and measurements resting on   
permanent objects, the entire region has been reduced to a   
demarkation comprehending the whole area. The locations of then-existing roads have been obtained from the   
returns of laying-out committees, and other evidence in   
the records and files. The construction of the map, in all   
its details, is the result of the researches and labors of   
W. P. <hi rend="smallcaps">Upham.</hi></p>   
<p>The death-warrant is a photograph by E. R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Perkins,</hi>   
of Salem. The original, among the papers on file in the   
office of the clerk of the courts of Essex County, having   
always been regarded as a great curiosity, has been subjected to constant handling, and become much obscured by   
dilapidation. The letters, and in some instances entire   
words, at the end of the lines, are worn off. To preserve it,   
if possible, from further injury, it has been pasted on cloth.   
Owing to this circumstance, and the yellowish hue to which   
the paper has faded, it does not take favorably by photograph; but the exactness of imitation, which can only thus   
be obtained with absolute certainty, is more important than   
any other consideration. Only so much as contains the body   
of the warrant, the sheriff's return, and the seal, are given.

The tattered margins are avoided, as they reveal the cloth,   
and impair the antique aspect of the document. The original is slowly disintegrating and wasting away, notwithstanding the efforts to preserve it; and its appearance, as   
seen to-day, can only be perpetuated in photograph.   
The warrant is reduced about one-third, and the return   
one-half.</p>   
<p>The Townsend Bishop house and the outlines of Witch   
Hill are from sketches by O. W. H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Upham.</hi> The English   
house is from a drawing made on the spot by J. R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Penniman</hi> of Boston, in 1822, a few years before its demolition,   
for the use of which I am indebted to <hi rend="smallcaps">James Kimball,</hi>   
Esq., of Salem. The view of Salem Village and of the   
Jacobs' house are reduced, by O. W. H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Upham,</hi> from   
photographs by E. R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Perkins.</hi></p>

<p>IT is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the   
human being, that he loves to contemplate the   
scenes of the past, and desires to have his own history   
borne down to the future. This, like all the other propensities of our nature, is accompanied by faculties to   
secure its gratification. The gift of speech, by which   
the parent can convey information to the child &mdash; the   
old transmit intelligence to the young &mdash; is an indication that it is the design of the Author of our being   
that we should receive from those passing away the   
narrative of their experience, and communicate the   
results of our own to the generations that succeed us.   
All nations have, to a greater or less degree, been   
faithful to their trust in using the gift to fulfil the   
design of the Giver. It is impossible to name a people who do not possess cherished traditions that have   
descended from their early ancestors.</p>   
<p>Although it is generally considered that the invention of a system of arbitrary and external signs to   
communicate thought is one of the greatest and most   
<pb n="002" id="vI002"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1045">   
<figDesc>Page 002.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
arduous achievements of human ingenuity, yet so   
universal is the disposition to make future generations   
acquainted with our condition and history, &mdash; a disposition the efficient cause of which can only be found   
in a sense of the value of such knowledge, &mdash; that you   
can scarcely find a people on the face of the globe, who   
have not contrived, by some means or other, from the   
rude monument of shapeless rock to the most perfect alphabetical language, to communicate with posterity; thus declaring, as with the voice of Nature   
herself, that it is desirable and proper that all men   
should know as much as possible of the character,   
actions, and fortunes of their predecessors on the stage   
of life.</p>   
<p>It is not difficult to discern the end for which this   
disposition to preserve for the future and contemplate   
the past was imparted to us. If all that we knew   
were what is taught by our individual experience, our   
minds would have but little, comparatively, to exercise   
and expand them, and our characters would be the result of the limited influences embraced within the   
narrow sphere of our particular and immediate relations and circumstances. But, as our notice is extended in the observation of those who have lived   
before us, our materials for reflection and sources of   
instruction are multiplied. The virtues we admire in   
our ancestors not only adorn and dignify their names,   
but win us to their imitation. Their prosperity and   
happiness spread abroad a diffusive light that reaches   
us, and brightens our condition. The wisdom that   
<pb n="003" id="vI003"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1046">   
<figDesc>Page 003.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
guided their footsteps becomes, at the same time, a   
lamp to our path. The observation of the errors of   
their course, and of the consequent disappointments   
and sufferings that befell them, enables us to pass in   
safety through rocks and ledges on which they were   
shipwrecked; and, while we grieve to see them eating   
the bitter fruits of their own ignorance and folly as   
well as vices and crimes, we can seize the benefit of   
their experience without paying the price at which   
they purchased it.</p>   
<p>In the desire which every man feels to learn the   
history, and be instructed by the example, of his   
predecessors, and in the accompanying disposition,   
with the means of carrying it into effect, to transmit a   
knowledge of himself and his own times to his successors, we discover the wise and admirable arrangement   
of a providence which removes the worn-out individual to a better country, but leaves the acquisitions   
of his mind and the benefit of his experience as an   
accumulating and common fund for the use of his   
posterity; which has secured the continued renovation   
of the race, without the loss of the wisdom of each   
generation.</p>   
<p>These considerations suggest the true definition of   
history. It is the instrument by which the results   
of the great experiment of human action on this theatre of being are collected and transmitted from age to   
age. Speaking through the records of history, the   
generations that have gone warn and guide the generations that follow. History is the Past, teaching   
Philosophy to the Present, for the Future.</p>

<figure entity="Uphv1047">   
<figDesc>Page 004.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>Since this is the true and proper design of history,   
it assumes an exalted station among the branches of   
human knowledge. Every community that aspires to   
become intelligent and virtuous should cherish it.   
Institutions for the promotion and diffusion of useful   
information should have special reference to it. And   
all people should be induced to look back to the days   
of their forefathers, to be warned by their errors,   
instructed by their wisdom, and stimulated in the   
career of improvement by the example of their   
virtues.</p>   
<p>The historian would find a great amount and   
variety of materials in the annals of this old town, &mdash;   
greater, perhaps, than in any other of its grade in the   
country. But there is one chapter in our history of   
pre-eminent interest and importance. The witchcraft   
delusion of 1692 has attracted universal attention   
since the date of its occurrence, and will, in all   
coming ages, render the name of Salem notable   
throughout the world. Wherever the place we live in   
is mentioned, this memorable transaction will be   
found associated with it; and those who know nothing else of our history or our character will be sure   
to know, and tauntingly to inform us that they know,   
that we hanged the witches.</p>   
<p>It is surely incumbent upon us to possess ourselves   
of correct and just views of a transaction thus indissolubly connected with the reputation of our home,   
with the memory of our fathers, and, of course, with   
the most precious part of the inheritance of our children.   
<pb n="005" id="vI005"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1048">   
<figDesc>Page 005.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
I am apprehensive that the community is very   
superficially acquainted with this transaction. All   
have heard of the Salem witchcraft; hardly any are   
aware of the real character of that event. Its mention creates a smile of astonishment, and perhaps a   
sneer of contempt, or, it may be, a thrill of horror for   
the innocent who suffered; but there is reason to fear,   
that it fails to suggest those reflections, and impart   
that salutary instruction, without which the design of   
Providence in permitting it to take place cannot be   
accomplished. There are, indeed, few passages in the   
history of any people to be compared with it in all   
that constitutes the pitiable and tragical, the mysterious and awful. The student of human nature will   
contemplate in its scenes one of the most remarkable   
developments which that nature ever assumed; while   
the moralist, the statesman, and the Christian philosopher will severally find that it opens widely before   
them a field fruitful in instruction.</p>   
<p>Our ancestors have been visited with unmeasured   
reproach for their conduct on the occasion. Sad,   
indeed, was the delusion that came over them, and   
shocking the extent to which their bewildered imaginations and excited passions hurried and drove them   
on. Still, however, many considerations deserve to be   
well weighed before sentence is passed upon them.   
And while I hope to give evidence of a readiness to   
have every thing appear in its own just light, and to   
expose to view the very darkest features of the transaction, I am confident of being able to bring forward   
<pb n="006" id="vI006"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1049">   
<figDesc>Page 006.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
such facts and reflections as will satisfy you that no   
reproach ought to be attached to them, in consequence   
of this affair, which does not belong, at least equally,   
to all other nations, and to the greatest and best men   
of their times and of previous ages; and, in short,   
that the final predominating sentiment their conduct   
should awaken is not so much that of anger and   
indignation as of pity and compassion.</p>   
<p>Let us endeavor to carry ourselves back to the state   
of the colony of Massachusetts one hundred and   
seventy years ago. The persecutions our ancestors   
had undergone in their own country, and the privations, altogether inconceivable by us, they suffered   
during the early years of their residence here, acting   
upon their minds and characters, in co-operation with   
the influences of the political and ecclesiastical occurrences that marked the seventeenth century, had   
imparted a gloomy, solemn, and romantic turn to   
their dispositions and associations, which was transmitted without diminution to their children, strengthened and aggravated by their peculiar circumstances.   
It was the triumphant age of superstition. The imagination had been expanded by credulity, until it   
had reached a wild and monstrous growth. The   
Puritans were always prone to subject themselves   
to its influence; and New England, at the time to   
which we are referring, was a most fit and congenial   
theatre upon which to display its power. Cultivation   
had made but a slight encroachment on the wilderness. Wide, dark, unexplored forests covered the   
<pb n="007" id="vI007"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1050">   
<figDesc>Page 007.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
hills, hung over the lonely roads, and frowned upon   
the scattered settlements. Persons whose lives have   
been passed where the surface has long been opened,   
and the land generally cleared, little know the power   
of a primitive wilderness upon the mind. There is   
nothing more impressive than its sombre shadows and   
gloomy recesses. The solitary wanderer is ever and   
anon startled by the strange, mysterious sounds that   
issue from its hidden depths. The distant fall of an   
ancient and decayed trunk, or the tread of animals as   
they prowl over the mouldering branches with which   
the ground is strown; the fluttering of unseen birds   
brushing through the foliage, or the moaning of the   
wind sweeping over the topmost boughs, &mdash; these all   
tend to excite the imagination and solemnize the   
mind. But the stillness of a forest is more startling   
and awe-inspiring than its sounds. Its silence is so   
deep as itself to become audible to the inner soul. It   
is not surprising that wooded countries have been the   
fruitful fountains and nurseries of superstition.</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;In such a place as this, at such an hour,</l>   
<l>If ancestry can be in aught believed,</l>   
<l>Descending spirits have conversed with man,</l>   
<l>And told the secrets of the world unknown.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>The forests which surrounded our ancestors were   
the abode of a mysterious race of men of strange   
demeanor and unascertained origin. The aspects they   
presented, the stories told of them, and every thing   
connected with them, served to awaken fear, bewilder   
the imagination, and aggravate the tendencies of the   
general condition of things to fanatical enthusiasm.</p>   
<pb n="008" id="vI008"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1051">

</p>   
<p>It was the common belief, sanctioned, as will appear   
in the course of this discussion, not by the clergy   
alone, but by the most learned scholars of that and   
the preceding ages, that the American Indians were   
the subjects and worshippers of the Devil, and their   
powwows, wizards.</p>   
<p>In consequence of this opinion, the entire want of   
confidence and sympathy to which it gave rise, and   
the provocations naturally incident to two races of   
men, of dissimilar habits, feelings, and ideas, thrown   
into close proximity, a state of things was soon   
brought about which led to conflicts and wars of the   
most distressing and shocking character. A strongly   
rooted sentiment of hostility and horror became associated in the minds of the colonists with the name of   
Indian. There was scarcely a village where the marks   
of savage violence and cruelty could not be pointed   
out, or an individual whose family history did not   
contain some illustration of the stealth, the malice   
or the vengeance of the savage foe. In 1689, John   
Bishop, and Nicholas Reed a servant of Edward Put   
nam; and, in 1690, Godfrey Sheldon, were killed by   
Indians in Salem. In the year 1691, about six   
months previous to the commencement of the witchcraft delusion, the county of Essex was ordered to   
keep twenty-four scouts constantly in the field, to   
guard the frontiers against the savage enemy, and   
to give notice of his approach, then looked for every   
hour with the greatest alarm and apprehension.</p>   
<p>Events soon justified the dread of Indian hostilities   
<pb n="009" id="vI009"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1052">   
<figDesc>Page 009.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
   
felt by the people of this neighborhood. Within six   
years after the witchcraft delusion, incursions of the   
savage foe took place at various points, carrying terror   
to all hearts. In August, 1696, they killed or took   
prisoners fifteen persons at Billerica, burning many   
houses. In October of the same year, they came   
upon Newbury, and carried off and tomahawked nine   
persons; all of whom perished, except a lad who   
survived his wounds. In 1698, they made a murderous and destructive assault upon Haverhill. The story   
of the capture, sufferings, and heroic achievements of   
Hannah Dustin, belongs to the history of this event.   
It stands by the side of the immortal deed of Judith,   
and has no other parallel in all the annals of female   
daring and prowess. On the 3d of July, 1706, a garrison was stormed at night in Dunstable; and Holyoke,   
a son of Edward Putnam, with three other soldiers, was   
killed. He was twenty-two years of age. In 1708,   
seven hundred Algonquin and St. Francis Indians,   
under the command of French officers, fell again upon   
Haverhill about break of day, on the 29th of August;   
consigned the town to conflagration and plunder;   
destroyed a large amount of property; massacred the   
minister Mr. Rolfe, the commander of the post Captain Wainwright, together with nearly forty others;   
and carried off many into captivity. On this occasion,   
a troop of horse and a foot company from Salem   
Village rushed to the rescue; the then minister of the   
parish, the Rev. Joseph Green, seized his gun and   
went with them. They pursued the flying Indians for   
<pb n="010" id="vI010"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1053">   
<figDesc>Page 010.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
some distance. So deeply were the people of Haverhill impressed by the valor and conduct of Mr. Green   
and his people, that they sent a letter of thanks, and   
desired him to come and preach to them. He complied   
with the invitation, spent a Sunday there, and thus   
gave them an opportunity to express personally their   
gratitude. On other occasions, he accompanied his   
people on similar expeditions.</p>   
<p>These occurrences show that the fears and anxieties   
of the colonists in reference to Indian assaults were   
not without grounds at the period of the witchcraft   
delusion. They were, at that very time, hanging like   
a storm cloud over their heads, soon to burst, and   
spread death and destruction among them.</p>   
<p>There was but little communication between the   
several villages and settlements. To travel from   
Boston to Salem, for instance, which the ordinary   
means of conveyance enable us to do at present in   
less than an hour, was then the fatiguing, adventurous, and doubtful work of an entire day.</p>   
<p>It was the darkest and most desponding period in   
the civil history of New England. The people, whose   
ruling passion then was, as it has ever since been, a   
love for constitutional rights, had, a few years before,   
been thrown into dismay by the loss of their charter, and, from that time, kept in a feverish state   
of anxiety respecting their future political destinies.   
In addition to all this, the whole sea-coast was exposed to danger: ruthless pirates were continually   
prowling along the shores. Commerce was nearly   
<pb n="011" id="vI011"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1054">   
<figDesc>Page 011.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
extinguished, and great losses had been experienced   
by men in business. A recent expedition against   
Canada had exposed the colonies to the vengeance of   
France.</p>   
<p>The province was encumbered with oppressive taxes,   
and weighed down by a heavy debt. The sum assessed upon Salem to defray the expenses of the   
country at large, the year before the witchcraft prosecutions, was &pound;1,346. 1<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> Besides this, there were   
the town taxes. The whole amounted, no doubt,   
inclusive of the support of the ministry, to a weight   
of taxation, considering the greater value of money at   
that time, of which we have no experience, and can   
hardly form an adequate conception. The burden   
pressed directly upon the whole community. There   
were then no great private fortunes, no moneyed   
institutions, no considerable foreign commerce, few, if   
any, articles of luxury, and no large business-capitals   
to intercept and divert its pressure. It was borne to   
its whole extent by the unaided industry of a population of extremely moderate estates and very limited   
earnings, and almost crushed it to the earth.</p>   
<p>The people were dissatisfied with the new charter.   
They were becoming the victims of political jealousies, discontent, and animosities. They had been   
agitated by great revolutions. They were surrounded   
by alarming indications of change, and their ears   
were constantly assailed by rumors of war. Their   
minds were startled and confounded by the prevalence   
of prophecies and forebodings of dark and dismal   
<pb n="012" id="vI012"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1055">   
<figDesc>Page 012.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
events. At this most unfortunate moment, and, as it   
were, to crown the whole and fill up the measure of   
their affliction and terror, it was their universal and   
sober belief, that the Evil One himself was, in a   
special manner, let loose, and permitted to descend   
upon them with unexampled fury.</p>   
<p>The people of Salem participated in their full share   
of the gloom and despondency that pervaded the   
province, and, in addition to that, had their own peculiar troubles and distresses. Within a short time,   
the town had lost almost all its venerable fathers and   
leading citizens, the men whose councils had governed and whose wisdom had guided them from the   
first years of the settlement of the place. Only those   
who are intimately acquainted with the condition of a   
community of simple manners and primitive feelings,   
such as were the early New-England settlements, can   
have an adequate conception of the degree to which   
the people were attached to their patriarchs, the extent   
of their dependence upon them, and the amount of   
the loss when they were removed.</p>   
<p>In the midst of this general distress and local   
gloom and depression, the great and awful tragedy,   
whose incidents, scenes, and characters I am to present, took place.</p>

<p>IT is necessary, before entering upon the subject of   
the witchcraft delusion, to give a particular and   
extended account of the immediate locality where it   
occurred, and of the community occupying it. This is   
demanded by justice to the parties concerned, and indispensable to a correct understanding of the transaction. No one, in truth, can rightly appreciate the   
character of the rural population of the towns first   
settled in Massachusetts, without tracing it to its origin, and taking into view the policy that regulated the   
colonization of the country at the start.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;The Governor and Company of the Massachusetts   
Bay in New England&rdquo; possessed, by its charter from   
James the First, dated Nov. 3, 1620, and renewed by   
Charles the First, March 4, 1629, the entire sovereignty over all the territory assigned to it. Some   
few conditions and exceptions were incorporated in the   
grant, which, in the event, proved to be merely nominal.   
<pb n="016" id="vI016"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1059">   
<figDesc>Page 016.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
The company, so far as the crown and sovereignty of England were concerned, became absolute   
owner of the whole territory within its limits, and   
exercised its powers accordingly. It adopted wise   
and efficient measures to promote the settlement of   
the country by emigrants of the best description. It   
gave to every man who transported himself at his own   
charge fifty acres of land, and lots, in distinction   
from farms, to those who should choose to settle and   
build in towns. In 1628, Captain John Endicott, one   
of the original patentees, was sent over to superintend   
the management of affairs on the spot, and carry   
out the views of the company. On the 30th of   
April, 1629, the company, by a full and free election,   
chose said Endicott to be &ldquo;Governor of the Plantation in the Massachusetts Bay,&rdquo; to hold office for   
one year &ldquo;from the time he shall take the oath,&rdquo;   
and gave him instructions for his government. In   
reference to the disposal of lands, they provided   
that persons &ldquo;who were adventurers,&rdquo; that is, subscribers to the common stock, to the amount of fifty   
pounds, should have two hundred acres of land, and,   
at that rate, more or less, &ldquo;to the intent to build   
their houses, and to improve their labors thereon.&rdquo;   
Adventurers who carried families with them were to   
have fifty acres for each member of their respective   
families. Other provisions were made, on the same   
principles, to meet the case of servants taken over; for   
each of whom an additional number of acres was to be   
allowed. If a person should choose &ldquo;to build on the   
<pb n="017" id="vI017"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1060">   
<figDesc>Page 017.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
   
plot of ground where the town is intended to be built,&rdquo;   
he was to have half an acre for every fifty pounds subscribed by him to the common stock. A general discretion was given to Endicott and his council to make   
grants to particular persons, &ldquo;according to their   
charge and quality;&rdquo; having reference always to the   
ability of the grantee to improve his allotment. Energetic and intelligent men, having able-bodied sons or   
servants, even if not adventurers, were to be favorably   
regarded. Endicott carried out these instructions   
faithfully and judiciously during his brief administration. In the mean time, it had been determined to   
transfer the charter, and the company bodily, to New   
England. Upon this being settled, John Winthrop,   
with others, joined the company, and he was elected its   
governor on the 29th of October, 1629. On the 12th   
of June, 1630, he arrived in Salem, and held his first   
court at Charlestown on the 28th of August.</p>   
<p>There was some irregularity in these proceedings.   
The charter fixed a certain time, &ldquo;yearly, once in the   
year, for ever hereafter,&rdquo; for the election of governor,   
deputy-governor, and assistants. Matthew Cradock   
had been elected accordingly, on the 13th of May,   
1629, governor of the company &ldquo;for the year following.&rdquo; He presided at the General Court of the company when Winthrop was elected governor. There   
does not appear to have been any formal resignation   
of his office by Cradock. In point of fact, the charter made no provision for a resignation of office, but   
only for cases where a vacancy might be occasioned   
<pb n="018" id="vI018"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1061">   
<figDesc>Page 018.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
by death, or removal by an act of the company. It   
would have been more regular for the company to have   
removed Cradock by a formal vote; but the great and   
weighty matter in which they were engaged prevented   
their thinking of a mere formality. Cradock had himself conceived the project they had met to carry into   
effect, and labored to bring it about. He vacated the   
chair to his successor, on the spot. Still forgetting   
the provisions of the charter, they declared Winthrop   
elected &ldquo;for the ensuing year, to begin on this present   
day,&rdquo; the 20th of October, 1629. By the language of   
the charter, he could only be elected to fill the vacancy &ldquo;in the room or place&rdquo; of Cradock; that is,   
for the residue of the official year established by the   
express provision of that instrument, namely, until   
the &ldquo;last Wednesday in Easter term&rdquo; ensuing. All   
usage is in favor of this construction. The terms of   
the charter are explicit; and, if persons chosen to fill   
vacancies during the course of a year could thus be   
commissioned to hold an entire year from the date of   
their election, the provision fixing a certain day   
&ldquo;yearly&rdquo; for the choice of officers would be utterly   
nullified. Whether this subsequently occurred to   
Winthrop and his associates is not known; but, if it   
did, it was impossible for them to act in conformity   
to the view now given; for, in the ensuing &ldquo;last   
Wednesday of Easter term,&rdquo; he was at sea, in mid   
ocean, and the several members of the company dispersed throughout his fleet. When he arrived in   
Salem, he found Endicott &mdash; who, in the records of the   
<pb n="019" id="vI019"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1062">   
<figDesc>Page 019.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
company before its transfer to New England, is styled   
&ldquo;the Governor beyond the seas&rdquo; &mdash; with his year of   
office not yet expired. The company had not chosen   
another in his place, and his commission still held   
good. It was so evident that the vote extending the   
term of Winthrop's tenure to a year from the day on   
which he was chosen, Oct. 20, 1629, was illegal, that   
when that year expired, in October, 1630, no motion   
was made to proceed to a new election. In the mean   
time, however, Endicott's year had expired; and, for   
aught that appears, there was not, for several months,   
any legal governor or government at all in the colony.   
When the next &ldquo;last Wednesday of Easter term&rdquo;   
came round, on the 18th of May, 1631, Winthrop was   
chosen governor, as the record says, &ldquo;according to the   
meaning of the patent;&rdquo; and all went on smoothly   
afterwards. If the difficulty into which they had got   
was apprehended by Winthrop, Endicott, or any of   
their associates, they were wise enough to see that   
nothing but mischief could arise from taking notice of   
it; that no human ingenuity could disentangle the   
snarl; and that all they could do was to wait for the   
lapse of time to drift them through. The conduct of   
these two men on the occasion was truly admirable.   
Endicott welcomed Winthrop with all the honors due   
to his position as governor; opened his doors to receive him and his family; and manifested the affectionate respect and veneration with which, from his   
earliest manhood to his dying day, Winthrop ever inspired all men in all circumstances. Winthrop performed   
<pb n="020" id="vI020"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1063">   
<figDesc>Page 020.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the ceremony at Endicott's marriage. They   
each went about his own business, and said nothing   
of the embarrassments attached to their official titles   
or powers. After a few months, Winthrop held his   
courts, as though all was in good shape; and Endicott   
took his seat as an assistant. They proved themselves   
sensible, high-minded men, of true public spirit, and   
friends to each other and to the country, which will   
for ever honor them both as founders and fathers.   
They entered into no disputes &mdash; and their descendants   
never should &mdash; about which was governor, or which   
first governor.</p>   
<p>The disposal of lands, at the expiration of Endicott's   
delegated administration, passed back into the hands   
of the company, and was conducted by the General   
Court upon the policy established at its meetings in   
London. On the 3d of March, 1635, the General   
Court relinquished the control and disposal of lands,   
within the limits of towns, to the towns themselves.   
After this, all grants of lands in Salem were made   
by the people of the town or their own local courts.   
The original land policy was faithfully adhered to   
here, as it probably was in the other towns.</p>   
<p>The following is a copy of the Act: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Whereas particular towns have many things which concern only themselves, and the ordering of their own affairs,   
and disposing of businesses in their own towns, it is therefore   
ordered, that the freemen of any town, or the major part of   
them, shall only have power to dispose of their own lands   
and woods, with all the privileges and appurtenances of the   
<pb n="021" id="vI021"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1064">   
<figDesc>Page 021.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
said towns, to grant lots, and make such orders as may concern the well ordering of their own towns, not repugnant to   
the laws and orders here established by the General Court;   
as also to lay <unclear></unclear> and penalties for the breach of these   
orders, and to levy and distress the same, not exceeding the   
sum of twenty shillings; also to choose their own particular   
officers, as constables, surveyors of the high-ways, and the   
like; and because much business is like to ensue to the constables of several towns, by reason they are to make distress,   
and gather fines, therefore that every town shall have two   
constables, where there is need, that so their office may not   
be a burthen unto them, and they may attend more carefully   
upon the discharge of their office, for which they shall be   
liable to give their accounts to this court, when they shall   
be called thereunto.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The reflecting student of political science will probably regard this as the most important legislative act   
in our annals. Towns had existed before, but were   
scarcely more than local designations, or convenient   
divisions of the people and territories. This called   
them into being as depositories and agents of political   
power in its mightiest efficacy and most vital force.   
It remitted to the people their original sovereignty.   
Before, that sovereignty had rested in the hands of a   
remote central deputation; this returned it to them   
in their primary capacity, and brought it back, in its   
most important elements, to their immediate control.   
It gave them complete possession and absolute power   
over their own lands, and provided the machinery for   
managing their own neighborhoods and making and   
<pb n="022" id="vI022"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1065">   
<figDesc>Page 022.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
executing their own laws in what is, after all, the   
greatest sphere of government, &mdash; that which concerns   
ordinary, daily, immediate relations. It gave to the   
people the power to do and determine all that the people can do and determine, by themselves. It created   
the towns as the solid foundation of the whole political   
structure of the State, trained the people as in a perpetual school for self-government, and fitted them to   
be the guardians of republican liberty and order.</p>   
<p>Large tracts were granted to men who had the disposition and the means for improving them by opening   
roads, building bridges, clearing forests, and bringing   
the surface into a state for cultivation. Men of property,   
education, and high social position, were thus made to   
lead the way in developing the agricultural resources   
of the country, and giving character to the farming   
interest and class. In cases where men of energy, industry, and intelligence presented themselves, if not   
adventurers in the common stock, with no other property than their strong arms and resolute wills, particularly if they had able-bodied sons, liberal grants   
were made. Every one who had received a town lot   
of half an acre was allowed to relinquish it, receiving,   
in exchange, a country lot of fifty acres or more.   
Under this system, a population of a superior order   
was led out into the forest. Farms quickly spread   
into the interior, seeking the meadows, occupying the   
arable land, and especially following up the streams.</p>   
<p>I propose to illustrate this by a very particular   
enumeration of instances, and by details that will give

us an insight of the personal, domestic, and social   
elements that constituted the condition of life in the   
earliest age of New England, particularly in that part   
of the old township of Salem where the scene of our   
story is laid. I shall give an account of the persons   
and families who first settled the region included in,   
and immediately contiguous to, Salem Village, and   
whose children and grandchildren were actors or sufers in, or witnesses of, the witchcraft delusion. I am   
able, by the map, to show the boundaries, to some degree of precision, of their farms, and the spots on or   
near which their houses stood.</p>   
<p>The first grant of land made by the company, after   
it had got fairly under way, was of six hundred acres   
to Governor Winthrop, on the 6th of September, 1631,   
&ldquo;near his house at Mystic.&rdquo; The next was to the deputy, Thomas Dudley, on the 5th of June, 1632,   
of two hundred acres &ldquo;on the west side of Charles   
River, over against the new town,&rdquo; now Cambridge.   
The next, on the 3d of July, 1632, was three hundred   
acres to John Endicott. It is described, in the record, as &ldquo;bounded on the south side with a river,   
commonly called the Cow House River, on the north   
side with a river, commonly called the Duck River, on   
the east with a river, leading up to the two former   
rivers, known by the name of Wooleston River, and on   
the west with the main land.&rdquo; The meaning of the   
Indian word applied to this territory was &ldquo;Birchwood.&rdquo; At the period of the witchcraft delusion, and   
for some time afterwards, &ldquo;Cow House River&rdquo; was   
<pb n="024" id="vI024"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1067">   
<figDesc>Page 024.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
called &ldquo;Endicott River.&rdquo; Subsequently it acquired   
the name of &ldquo;Waters River.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>This grant constituted what was called &ldquo;the Governor Orchard Farm.&rdquo; In conformity with the policy   
on which grants were made, Endicott at once proceeded to occupy and improve it, by clearing off the   
woods, erecting buildings, making roads, and building   
bridges. His dwelling-house embraced in its view the   
whole surrounding country, with the arms of the sea.   
From the more elevated points of his farm, the open   
sea was in sight. A road was opened by him, from   
the head of tide water on Duck, now Crane, River,   
through the Orchard Farm, and round the head of Cow   
House River, to the town of Salem, in one direction,   
and to Lynn and Boston in another. A few years   
afterwards, the town granted him two hundred acres   
more, contiguous to the western line of the Orchard   
Farm. After this, and as a part of the transaction,   
the present Ipswich road was made, and the old   
road through the Orchard Farm discontinued. This   
illustrates the policy of the land grants. They were   
made to persons who had the ability to lay out roads.   
The present bridge over Crane River was probably   
built by Endicott and the parties to whom what is now   
called the Plains, one of the principal villages of Danvers, had been granted. The tract granted by the   
town was popularly called the &ldquo;Governor's Plain.&rdquo;   
By giving, in this way, large tracts of land to men of   
means, the country was opened and made accessible to   
settlers who had no pecuniary ability to incur large   
<pb n="025" id="vI025"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1068">   
<figDesc>Page 025.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
outlays in the way of general improvements, but had   
the requisite energy and industry to commence the   
work of subduing the forest and making farms for   
themselves. To them, smaller grants were made.</p>   
<p>The character of the population, thus aided at the   
beginning in settling the country, cannot be appreciated without giving some idea of what it was to open   
the wilderness for occupancy and cultivation. This is   
a subject which those who have always lived in other   
than frontier towns do not perhaps understand.</p>   
<p>How much of the land had been previously cleared   
by the aboriginal tribes, it may be somewhat difficult   
to determine. They were but slightly attached to the   
soil, had temporary and movable habitations, and no   
bulky implements or articles of furniture. They were   
nomadic in their habits. On the coast and its inlets,   
their light canoes gave easy means of transportation,   
for their families and all that they possessed, from   
point to point, and, further inland, over intervening   
territory, from river to river. They probably seldom   
attempted, in this part of the country, to clear the   
rugged and stony uplands. In some instances, they   
removed the trees from the soft alluvial meadows, although it is probable that in only a very few localities   
they would have attempted such a persistent and laborious undertaking. There were large salt marshes, and   
here and there meadows, free from timber. There   
were spots where fires had swept over the land and   
the trees disappeared. On such spots they probably   
planted their corn; the land being made at once fertile   
<pb n="026" id="vI026"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1069">   
<figDesc>Page 026.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and easily cultivable, by the effects of the fires. Near   
large inland sheets of water, having no outlets passable by their canoes, and well stocked with fish, they   
sometimes had permanent plantations, as at Will's Hill.   
With such slight exceptions, when the white settler   
came upon his grant, he found it covered by the primeval wilderness, thickly set with old trees, whose   
roots, as well as branches, were interlocked firmly   
with each other, the surface obstructed with tangled   
and prickly underbrush; the soil broken, and mixed   
with rocks and stones, &mdash; the entire face of the country hilly, rugged, and intersected by swamps and winding streams.</p>   
<p>Among all the achievements of human labor and   
perseverance recorded in history, there is none more   
herculean than the opening of a New-England forest   
to cultivation. The fables of antiquity are all suggestive of instruction, and infold wisdom. The earliest   
inhabitants of every wooded country, who subdued its   
wilderness, were truly a race of giants.</p>   
<p>Let any one try the experiment of felling and eradicating a single tree, and he will begin to approach an   
estimate of what the first English settler had before   
him, as he entered upon his work. It was not only a   
work of the utmost difficulty, calling for the greatest   
possible exercise of physical toil, strength, patience,   
and perseverance, but it was a work of years and generations. The axe, swung by muscular arms, could,   
one by one, fell the trees. There was no machinery to   
aid in extracting the tough roots, equal, often, in   
<pb n="027" id="vI027"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1070">   
<figDesc>Page 027.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
size and spread, to the branches. The practice was   
to level by the axe a portion of the forest, managing   
so as to have the trees fall inward, early in the season.   
After the summer had passed, and the fallen timber   
become dried, fire would be set to the whole tract covered by it. After it had smouldered out, there would   
be left charred trunks and stumps. The trunks   
would then be drawn together, piled in heaps, and   
burned again. Between the blackened stumps, barley   
or some other grain, and probably corn, would be   
planted, and the lapse of years waited for, before   
the roots would be sufficiently decayed to enable oxen   
with chains to extract them. Then the rocks and   
stones would have to be removed, before the plough   
could, to any considerable extent, be applied. As late   
as 1637, the people of Salem voted twenty acres, to be   
added within two years to his previous grant, to Richard Hutchinson, upon the condition that he would, in   
the mean time, &ldquo;set up ploughing.&rdquo; The meadow to   
the eastward of the meeting-house, seen in the headpiece of this Part, probably was the ground where   
ploughing was thus first &ldquo;set up.&rdquo; The plough had   
undoubtedly been used before in town-lots, and by   
some of the old planters who had secured favorable   
open locations along the coves and shores; but it   
required all this length of time to bring the interior   
country into a condition for its use.</p>   
<p>The opening of a wilderness combined circumstances of interest which are not, perhaps, equalled in   
any other occupation. It is impossible to imagine a   
<pb n="028" id="vI028"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1071">   
<figDesc>Page 028.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
more exhilarating or invigorating employment. It   
developed the muscular powers more equally and effectively than any other. The handling of the axe   
brought into exercise every part of the manly frame.   
It afforded room for experience and skill, as well as   
strength; it was an athletic art of the highest kind,   
and awakened energy, enterprise, and ambition; it   
was accompanied with sufficient danger to invest   
it with interest, and demand the most careful judgment and observation. He who best knew how to fell   
a tree was justly looked upon as the most valuable   
and the leading man. To bring a tall giant of the   
woods to the ground was a noble and perilous achievement. As it slowly trembled and tottered to its fall, it   
was all-important to give it the right direction, so that,   
as it came down with a thundering crash, it might not   
be diverted from its expected course by the surrounding trees and their multifarious branches, or its trunk   
slide off or rebound in an unforeseen manner, scattering fragments and throwing limbs upon the choppers   
below. Accidents often, deaths sometimes, occurred.   
A skilful woodman, by a glance at the surrounding   
trees and their branches, could tell where the tree on   
which he was about to operate should fall, and bring   
it unerringly to the ground in the right direction.   
There was, moreover, danger from lurking savages;   
and, if the chopper was alone in the deep woods,   
from the prowling solitary bear, or hungry wolves,   
which, going in packs, were sometimes formidable.   
There were elements also, in the work, that awakened   
<pb n="029" id="vI029"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1072">   
<figDesc>Page 029.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the finer sentiments. The lonely and solemn woods   
are God's first temples. They are full of mystic influences; they nourish the poetic nature; they feed the   
imagination. The air is elastic, and every sound   
reverberates in broken, strange, and inexplicable intonations. The woods are impregnated with a healthgiving and delightful fragrance nowhere else experienced. All the arts of modern luxury fail to produce   
an aroma like that which pervades a primitive forest   
of pines and spruces. Indeed, all trees, in an original   
wilderness, where they exist in every stage of growth   
and decay, contribute to this peculiar charm of the   
woods. It was not only a manly, but a most lively,   
occupation. When many were working near each   
other, the echoes of their voices of cheer, of the sharp   
and ringing tones of their axes, and of the heavy concussions of the falling timber, produced a music that   
filled the old forests with life, and made labor joyous   
and refreshing.</p>   
<p>The length of time required to prepare a country   
covered by a wilderness, on a New-England soil, for   
cultivation, may be estimated by the facts I have   
stated. A long lapse of years must intervene, after   
the woods have been felled and their dried trunks and   
branches burned, before the stumps can be extracted,   
the land levelled, the stones removed, the plough introduced, or the smooth green fields, which give such   
beauty to agricultural scenes, be presented. An   
immense amount of the most exhausting labor must   
be expended in the process. The world looks with   
<pb n="030" id="vI030"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1073">   
<figDesc>Page 030.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
wonder on the dykes of Holland, the wall of China,   
the pyramids of Egypt. I do not hesitate to say that   
the results produced by the small, scattered population   
of the American colonies, during their first century,   
in tearing up a wilderness by its roots, transforming   
the rocks, with which the surface was covered, into   
walls, opening roads, building bridges, and making a   
rough and broken country smooth and level, converting a sterile waste into fertile fields blossoming with   
verdure and grains and fruitage, is a more wonderful monument of human industry and perseverance   
than them all. It was a work, not of mere hired   
laborers, still less of servile minions, but of freemen   
owning, or winning by their voluntary and cheerful   
toil, the acres on which they labored, and thus entitling themselves to be the sovereigns of the country   
they were creating. A few thousands of such men,   
with such incentives, wrought wonders greater than   
millions of slaves or serfs ever have accomplished, or   
ever will.</p>   
<p>It was not, therefore, from mere favoritism, or a   
blind subserviency to men of wealth or station, that   
such liberal grants of land were made to Winthrop,   
Dudley, Endicott, and others, but for various wise and   
good reasons, having the welfare and happiness of the   
whole people, especially the poorer classes, in view.   
In illustration of the one now under consideration, a   
few facts may be presented. They will show the   
amount of labor required to bring the &ldquo;Orchard Farm&rdquo;   
into cultivation, and which must have been procured   
<pb n="031" id="vI031"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1074">   
<figDesc>Page 031.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
at a large outlay in money by the proprietor. In the   
court-files are many curious papers, in the shape of   
depositions given by witnesses in suits of various   
kinds, arising from time to time, showing that large   
numbers of hired men were kept constantly at work.   
Nov. 10, 1678, Edmund Grover, seventy-eight years   
old, testified, &ldquo;that, above forty-five years since, I, this   
deponent, wrought much upon Governor Endicott's   
farm, called Orchard, and did, about that time, help to   
cut and cleave about seven thousand palisadoes, as I   
remember, and was the first that made improvement   
thereof, by breaking up of ground and planting of   
Indian-corn.&rdquo; The land was granted to Endicott in   
July, 1632; and the work in which Grover, with others, was engaged, commenced undoubtedly forthwith.   
Palisadoes were young trees, of about six inches in   
diameter at the butt, cut into poles of about ten feet   
in length, sharpened at the larger end, and driven into   
the ground; those that were split or cloven were used   
as rails. In this way, lots were fenced in. In some   
cases, the upright posts were placed close together, as   
palisades in fortifications, to prevent the escape of   
domestic animals, and as a safeguard against depredations upon the young cattle, sheep, and poultry, by   
bears, wolves, foxes, the loup-cervier, or wild-cat, with   
which the woods were infested. Grover seems to have   
wrought on the Orchard Farm for a short time. We   
find, that, a few years after the point to which his testimony goes back, he had a farm of his own. Some   
wrought there for a longer time, and were permanent   
<pb n="032" id="vI032"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1075">   
<figDesc>Page 032.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
retainers on the farm. In 1635, the widow Scarlett   
apprenticed her son Benjamin, then eleven years of   
age, to Governor Endicott. The following document,   
recorded in Essex Registry of Deeds, tells his   
story: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;To all christian people to whom these presents shall come,   
I, Benjamin Scarlett of Salem, in New England, sendeth   
Greeting &mdash; Know ye, that I, the said Benjamin Scarlett, having lived as a servant with Mr. John Endicott, Esq. sometimes Governor in New England, and served him near upon   
thirty years, for, and in consideration whereof, the said Governor Endicott gave unto me, the said Benjamin Scarlett, a   
certain tract of land, in the year 1650, being about 10 acres,   
more or less, the which land hath ever since been possessed by   
me, the said Benjamin Scarlett, and it lyeth at the head of   
Cow House River, bounded on the north with the land of Mr.   
Endicott called Orchard Farm, on the South with the high   
way leading to the salt water, on the West with the road way   
leading to Salem, on the East with the salt water, which tract   
of land was given to me, as aforesaid, during my life, and in   
case I should leave no issue of my body, to give it to such of   
his posterity as I should see cause to bestow it upon; Know   
ye, therefore, that I, the said Benjamin Scarlett, for divers   
considerations me thereunto moving, have given, granted, and   
by these presents do give and grant, assign, sett over, and bestow the aforesaid tract of land, with all the improvements I   
have made thereon, both by building, fencing, or otherwise,   
unto Samuel Endicott, second son to Zerubabel Endicott deceased, and unto Hannah his wife, to have and to hold the   
said ten acres of land, more or less, with all the privileges and   
appurtenances thereunto belonging, unto the said Samuel   
<pb n="033" id="vI033"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1076">   
<figDesc>Page 033.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Endicott and Hannah his wife, to his and her own proper use   
and behoof forever; and after their decease I give the said   
tract of land to their son Samuel Endicott. In case he should   
depart this life without issue, then to be given to the next heir   
of the said Samuel and Hannah. &mdash; In witness whereof I have   
hereunto set my hand and seal. &mdash; Dated the ninth of January one thousand six hundred and ninety one. &mdash; <hi rend="smallcaps">Benjamin   
Scarlett,</hi> his mark.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>It is to be observed, that Governor Endicott had died   
twenty-six years, and his son Zerubabel seven years,   
before the date of the foregoing deed. No writings   
had passed between them in reference to the final disposition Scarlett was conditionally to make of the   
estate. There were no living witnesses of the original   
understanding. But the old man was true to the sentiments of honor and gratitude. The master to whom   
he had been apprenticed in his boyhood had been kind   
and generous to him, and he was faithful to the letter   
and spirit of his engagement. He evidently made a   
point to have the language of the deed as strong   
as it could be. He did not leave the matter to be   
settled by a will, but determined to enjoy, while living,   
the satisfaction of being true to his plighted faith. He   
was known, in his later years, as &ldquo;old Ben Scarlett.&rdquo;   
He did not feel ashamed to call himself a servant.   
But humble and unpretending as he was, I feel a pride   
in rescuing his name from oblivion. Old Ben Scarlett will for ever hold his place among nature's nobles,   
&mdash; honest men.</p>   
<p>The extent to which Endicott went in improving his   
<pb n="034" id="vI034"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1077">   
<figDesc>Page 034.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
lands is shown in the particular department which   
gave the name to his original grant. In 1648, he   
bought of Captain Trask two hundred and fifty acres   
of land, in another locality, giving in exchange five   
hundred apple-trees, of three years' growth. Such a   
number of fruit-trees of that age, disposable at so   
early a period, could only be the result of a great   
expenditure of labor and money. So many operations   
going on under his direction and within his premises   
made his farm a school, in which large numbers were   
trained to every variety of knowledge needed by an   
original settler. The subduing of the wilderness; the   
breaking of the ground; the building of bridges, stone, &ldquo;palisadoes,&rdquo; houses, and barns; the processes   
of planting; the introduction of all suitable articles of   
culture; the methods best adapted to the preparation   
of the rugged soil for production; the rearing of abundant orchards and bountiful crops; the smoothing and   
levelling of lands, and the laying-out of roads, &mdash; these   
were all going at once, and it was quite desirable for   
young men to work on his farm, before going out   
deeper into the wilderness to make farms for themselves. There were many besides Grover who availed   
themselves of the advantage. John Putnam was a   
large landholder, and an original grantee; but we find   
his youngest son, John, attached to Endicott's establishment, and working on his farm about the time of   
his maturity. In a deposition in court, in a land case   
of disputed boundaries, August, 1705, &ldquo;John Putnam.   
Sr., of full age, testifieth and saith that &mdash; being a retainer   
<pb n="035" id="vI035"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1078">   
<figDesc>Page 035.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in Governor Endicott's family, about fifty years   
since, and being intimately acquainted with the governor himself and with his son, Mr. Zerubabel Endicott, late of Salem, deceased, who succeeded in his   
father's right, and lived and died on the farm called   
Orchard Farm, in Salem &mdash; the said Governor Endicott   
did oftentimes tell this deponent,&rdquo; &amp;c. The same   
John Putnam, in a deposition dated 1678, says that   
he was then fifty years old, and that, thirty-five years   
before, he was at Mr. Endicott's farm, and went out to   
a certain place called &ldquo;Vine Cove,&rdquo; where he found Mr.   
Endicott; and he testifies to a conversation that he   
heard between Mr. Endicott and one of his men, Walter Knight. I mention these things to show that a lad   
of fifteen, a son of a neighbor of large estate in lands,   
was an intimate visitor at the Orchard Farm; and that,   
when he became of age, before entering upon the work   
of clearing lands of his own, given by his father, he   
went as &ldquo;a retainer&rdquo; to work on the governor's farm.   
He went as a voluntary laborer, as to a school of agricultural training. This was done on other farms, first   
occupied by men who had the means and the enterprise   
to carry on large operations. It gave a high character, in their particular employment, to the first settlers   
generally.</p>   
<p>I cannot leave this subject of Endicott on his farm,   
without presenting another picture, drawn from a wilderness scene. In 1678, Nathaniel Ingersol, then   
forty-five years of age, in a deposition sworn to in   
court, describes an incident that occurred on the eastern   
<pb n="036" id="vI036"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1079">   
<figDesc>Page 036.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
end of the Townsend Bishop farm as laid out on   
the map, when he was about eleven years of age. His   
father, Richard Ingersol, had leased the farm. It was   
contiguous to Endicott's land, and controversies of   
boundary arose, which subsequently contributed to   
aggravate the feuds and passions that were let loose in   
the fury of the witchcraft proceedings. Nathaniel Ingersol says, &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;This deponent testifieth, that, when my father had fenced   
in a parcel of land where the wolf-pits now are, the said Governor Endicott came to my father where we were at plough,   
and said to my father he had fenced in some of the said Governor land. My father replied, then he would remove   
the fence. No, said Governor Endicott, let it stand; and,   
when you set up a new fence, we will settle in the bounds.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>This statement is worthy of being preserved, as it   
illustrates the character of the two men, exhibiting   
them in a most honorable light. The gentlemanly   
bearing of each is quite observable. Ingersol manifests an instant willingness to repair a wrong, and set   
the matter right; Endicott is considerate and obliging   
on a point where men are most prone to be obstinate   
and unyielding, &mdash; a conflict of land rights: both are   
courteous, and disposed to accommodate. Endicott   
was governor of the colony, and a large conterminous   
landowner; Ingersol was a husbandman, at work   
with his boys on land into which their labor had incorporated value, and with which, for the time being,   
he was identified. But Endicott showed no arrogance,   
<pb n="037" id="vI037"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1080">   
<figDesc>Page 037.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and assumed no authority; Ingersol manifested no   
resentment or irritation. If a similar spirit had been   
everywhere exhibited, the good-will and harmony of   
neighborhoods would never have been disturbed, and   
the records of courts reduced to less than half their   
bulk.</p>   
<p>To his dying day, John Endicott retained a lively   
interest in promoting the welfare of his neighbors in   
the vicinity of the Orchard Farm.</p>   
<p>Father Gabriel Druillettes was sent by the Governor   
of Canada, in 1650, to Boston, in a diplomatic character, to treat with the Government here. He kept a   
journal, during his visit, from which the following is   
an extract: &ldquo;I went to Salem to speak to the Sieur   
Indicatt who speaks and understands French well,   
and is a good friend of the nation, and very desirous   
to have his children entertain this sentiment. Finding I had no money, he supplied me, and gave me an   
invitation to the magistrates' table.&rdquo; Endicott had   
undoubtedly received a good education. His natural   
force of character had been brought under the influence of the knowledge prevalent in his day, and   
invigorated by an experience and aptitude in practical   
affairs. There is some evidence that he had, in early   
life, been a surgeon or physician.</p>   
<p>He was a captain in the military service before   
leaving England. Although he was the earliest who   
bore the title of governor here, having been deputed   
to exercise that office by the governor and company   
in England, and subsequently elected to that station   
<pb n="038" id="vI038"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1081">   
<figDesc>Page 038.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
for a greater length of time than any other person in   
our history, had been colonel of the Essex militia,   
commandant of the expedition against the Indians at   
Block Island, and, for several years, major-general,   
at the head of the military forces of the colony, the   
title of captain was attached to him, more or less,   
from beginning to end; and it is a singular circumstance, that it has adhered to the name to this day.   
His descendants early manifested a predilection for   
maritime life. During the first half of the present   
century, many of them were shipmasters. In our   
foreign, particularly our East-India, navigation, the   
title has clung to the name; so much so, that the   
story is told, that, half a century ago, when American   
ships arrived at Sumatra or Java, the natives, on   
approaching or entering the vessels to ascertain the   
name of the captain, were accustomed to inquire,   
&ldquo;Who is the Endicott?&rdquo; The public station, rank,   
and influence of Governor Endicott required that he   
should first be mentioned, in describing the elements   
that went to form the character of the original agricultural population of this region.</p>   
<p>The map shows the farm of Emanuel Downing.   
The lines are substantially correct, although precise   
accuracy cannot be claimed for them, as the points   
mentioned in this and other cases were marked trees,   
heaps of stones, or other perishable or removable   
objects, and no survey or plot has come down to us.   
A collation of conterminous grants or subsequent   
conveyances, with references in some of them to   
<pb n="039" id="vI039"/>

<figDesc>Page 039.</figDesc>

permanent objects, enables us to approximate to a   
pretty certain conclusion. This gentleman was one of   
the most distinguished of the early New-England colonists. He was a lawyer of the Inner Temple. He   
married, in the first instance, a daughter of Sir James   
Ware, a person of great eminence in the learned lore   
of his times. His second wife was Lucy, sister of   
Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts, who was born   
July 9, 1601. They were married, April 10, 1622.   
There seems to have been a very strong attachment   
between Emanuel Downing and his brother Winthrop;   
and they went together, with their whole heart, into   
the plan of building up the colony. They devoted to   
it their fortunes and lives. Downing is supposed to   
have arrived at Boston in August, 1638, with his family. On the 4th of November, he and his wife were   
admitted to the Church at Salem. So great had been   
the value of his services in behalf of the colony, in   
defending its interests and watching over its welfare   
before leaving England, that he was welcomed with   
the utmost cordiality to his new home. His nephew,   
John Winthrop, Jr., afterwards Governor of Connecticut, was associated with John Endicott to administer   
to him the freeman's oath. The General Court   
granted him six hundred acres of land. He was   
immediately appointed a judge of the local court in   
Salem, and, for many years, elected one of its two   
deputies to the General Court. In anticipation of his   
arrival in the country, the town of Salem, on the 16th   
of July, granted him five hundred acres. He afterwards   
<pb n="040" id="vI040"/>

<figDesc>Page 040.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
purchased the farm on which he seems to have   
lived, for the most part, until he went to England in   
1652. The condition of public affairs, and his own   
connection with them, detained him in the mother much of the latter part of his life. While in   
this colony, he was indefatigable in his exertions to   
secure its prosperity. His wealth and time and faculties were liberally and constantly devoted to this   
end.</p>   
<p>The active part taken by Mr. Downing in the affairs   
of the settlement is illustrated in the following extract from the Salem town records:&mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;At a general Town meeting, held the 7th day of the 5th   
month, 1644 &mdash; ordered that two be appointed every Lord's   
Day, to walk forth in the time of God's worship, to take notice of such as either lye about the meeting house, without   
attending to the word and ordinances, or that lye at home or   
in the fields without giving good account thereof, and to take   
the names of such persons, and to present them to the magistrates, whereby they may be accordingly proceeded against.   
The names of such as are ordered to this service are for the   
1st day, Mr. Stileman and Philip Veren Jr. 2d day, Philip   
Veren Sr. and Hilliard Veren. 3d day, Mr. Batter and Joshua   
Veren. 4th day, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Clark. 5th day, Mr.   
Downing and Robert Molton Sr. 6th day, Robert Molton   
Jr. and Richard Ingersol. 7th day, John Ingersol and   
Richard Pettingell. 8th day, William Haynes and Richard   
Hutchinson. 9th day, John Putnam and John Hathorne.   
10th day, Townsend Bishop and Daniel Rea. 11th day, John   
Porter and Jacob Barney.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<pb n="041" id="vI041"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1084">   
<figDesc>Page 041.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>Each patrol, on concluding its day's service, was to   
notify the succeeding one; and they were to start on   
their rounds, severally, from &ldquo;Goodman Porter's near   
the Meeting House.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The men appointed to this service were all leading   
characters, reliable and energetic persons. It was a   
singular arrangement, and gives a vivid idea of the   
state of things at the time. Its design was probably,   
not merely that expressed in the vote of the town, but   
also to prevent any disorderly conduct on the part of   
those not attending public worship, and to give prompt   
alarm in case of fire or an Indian assault. The population had not then spread out far into the country;   
and the range of exploration did not much extend   
beyond the settlement in the town. None but active   
men, however, could have performed the duty thoroughly, and in all directions, so as to have kept the   
whole community under strict inspection.</p>   
<p>Mr. Downing probably expended liberally his fortune and time in improving his farm, upon which there   
were, at least, four dwelling-houses prior to 1661, and   
large numbers of men employed. He was a ready   
contributor to all public objects. His education had   
been superior and his attainments in knowledge extensive. He was of an enlightened spirit, and strove   
to mitigate the severity of the procedures against   
Antinomians and others. He seems to have had an   
ingenious and enterprising mind. At a General   
Court held at Boston, Sept. 6, 1638, it was voted   
that, &ldquo;Whereas Emanuel Downing, Esq., hath brought   
<pb n="042" id="vI042"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1085">   
<figDesc>Page 042.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
over, at his great charges, all things fitting for taking   
wild fowl by way of duck-coy, this court, being desirous to encourage him and others in such designs as   
tend to the public good,&rdquo; &amp;c., orders that liberty shall   
be given him to set up his duck-coy within the limits   
of Salem; and all persons are forbidden to molest   
him in his experiments, by &ldquo;shooting in any gun   
within half a mile of the ponds,&rdquo; where, by the regulations of the town, he shall be allowed to place the   
decoys. The court afterwards granted to other towns   
liberty to set up duck-coys, with similar privileges.   
What was the particular structure of the contrivance,   
and how far it succeeded in operation, is not known;   
but the thing shows the spirit of the man. He at   
once took hold of his farm with energy, and gathered   
workmen upon it. Winthrop in his journal has this   
entry, Aug. 2, 1645:&mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Mr. Downing having built a new house at his farm, he   
being gone to England, and his wife and family gone to the   
church meeting on the Lord's day, the chimney took fire and   
burned down the house, and bedding, apparel and household,   
to the value of 200 pounds.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>This proves that his family resided on the farm; and   
it indicates, that, when he first occupied it, he had   
only such a house as could have been seasonably put   
up at the start, but that a more commodious one had   
been erected at his leisure: the expression &ldquo;having   
built a new house&rdquo; appears to carry this idea. On his   
return from England, he undoubtedly built again, and   
<pb n="043" id="vI043"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1086">   
<figDesc>Page 043.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
had other houses for his workmen and tenants; for   
we find that one of them, in 1648, was allowed to keep   
an ordinary, &ldquo;as Mr. Downing's farm, on the road between Lynn and Ipswich, was a convenient place&rdquo; for   
such an accommodation to travellers. Public travel   
to and from those points goes over that same road to. That it was so early laid out is probably owing   
to the fact, that such men as Emanuel Downing were on   
its route, and John Winthrop, Jr., at Ipswich. Downing called his farm &ldquo;Groton,&rdquo; in dear remembrance of   
his wife's ancestral home in &ldquo;the old country.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Originally, travel was on a track more interior. The   
opening of roads did not begin until after the more   
immediate and necessary operations of erecting houses   
and bringing the land, on the most available spots near   
them at the points first settled, under culture. Originally, communication from farm to farm, through the   
woods, was by marking the trees, &mdash; sometimes by   
burning and blackening spots on their sides, and sometimes by cutting off a piece of the bark. The traveller   
found his way step by step, following the trees thus   
marked, or &ldquo;blazed,&rdquo; as it was called whichever method   
had been adopted. When the branches and brush   
were sufficiently cleared away, horses could be used.   
At places rendered difficult by large roots, partly above   
ground, intercepting the passage, or by rough stones,   
the rider would dismount, and lead the horse. From   
this, it was called a &ldquo;bridle-path.&rdquo; After the way had   
become sufficiently opened for ox-carts or other vehicles to pass, it would begin to receive the name of a   
<pb n="044" id="vI044"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1087">   
<figDesc>Page 044.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
road. On reaching a cleared and fenced piece of land,   
the traveller would cross it, opening and closing gates,   
or taking down and replacing bars, as the case might   
be. There were arrangements among the settlers, and,   
before long, acts of the General Court, regulating the   
matter. This was the origin of what were called   
&ldquo;press-roads,&rdquo; or &ldquo;farm-roads,&rdquo; or &ldquo;gate-roads.&rdquo;   
When a proprietor concluded it to be for his interest   
to do so, he would fence in the road on both sides   
where it crossed his land, and remove the gates or   
bars from each end. Ultimately, the road, if convenient for long travel, would be fenced in for a great   
distance, and become a permanent &ldquo;public highway.&rdquo;   
In all these stages of progress, it would be called a   
&ldquo;highway.&rdquo; The fee would remain with the several   
proprietors through whose lands it passed; and, if travel should forsake it for a more eligible route, it would   
be discontinued, and the road-track, enclosed in the   
fields to which it originally belonged, be obliterated   
by the plough. Many of the &ldquo;highways,&rdquo; by which   
the farmers passed over each other's lands to get to the   
meeting-house or out to public roads, in 1692, have thus   
disappeared, while some have hardened into permanent   
public roads used to this day. When thus fully and   
finally established, it became a &ldquo;town road,&rdquo; and if   
leading some distance into the interior, and through   
other towns, was called a &ldquo;country road.&rdquo; The early   
name of &ldquo;path&rdquo; continued some time in use long after   
it had got to be worthy of a more pretentious title. The   
old &ldquo;Boston Path,&rdquo; by which the country was originally   
<pb n="045" id="vI045"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1088">   
<figDesc>Page 045.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
penetrated, long retained that name. It ran through   
the southern and western part of Salem Village by the   
Gardners, Popes, Goodales, Flints, Needhams, Swinnertons, Houltons, and so on towards Ipswich and   
Newbury.</p>   
<p>On the 30th of September, 1648, Governor Winthrop, writing to his son John, says &ldquo;they are well at   
Salem, and your uncle is now beginning to distil. Mr.   
Endicott hath found a copper mine in his own ground.   
Mr. Leader hath tried it. The furnace runs eight tons   
per week, and their bar iron is as good as Spanish.&rdquo;   
Whatever may be thought by some of the logic which   
infers that &ldquo;all is well&rdquo; in Salem, because they are   
beginning &ldquo;to distil;&rdquo; and however little has, as yet,   
resulted here from the discovery of copper-mines, or   
the manufacture of iron, the foregoing extract shows   
the zeal and enthusiasm with which the wealthier settlers were applying themselves to the development of   
the capabilities of the country.</p>   
<p>Mr. Downing seems to have resided permanently on   
his farm, and to have been identified with the agricultural portion of the community. His house-lot in the   
town bounded south on Essex Street, extending from   
Newbury to St. Peter's Street. He may not, perhaps,   
have built upon it for some time, as it long continued   
to be called &ldquo;Downing's Field.&rdquo; Two of his daughters married sons of Thomas Gardner: Mary married Samuel; and Ann, Joseph. They came into   
possession of the &ldquo;Downing Field.&rdquo; Mary was the   
mother of John, the progenitor of a large branch of   
<pb n="046" id="vI046"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1089">   
<figDesc>Page 046.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the Gardner family. Mr. Downing had another large   
lot in the town, which, on the 11th of February, 1641,   
was sold to John Pickering, described in the deed as   
follows: &ldquo;All that parcel of ground, lying before the   
now dwelling-house of the said John Pickering, late in   
the occupation of John Endicott, Esq., with all the   
appurtenances thereunto belonging, abutting on the   
east and south on the river commonly called the South   
River, and on the west on the land of William   
Hathorne, and on the north on the Town Common.&rdquo;   
The deed is signed by Lucy Downing, and by Edmund   
Batter, acting for her husband in his absence. On the   
10th of February, 1644, he indorsed the transaction as   
follows: &ldquo;I do freely agree to the sale of the said   
Field in Salem, made by my wife to John Pickering:   
witness my hand,&rdquo; &amp;c. The attesting witnesses were   
Samuel Sharpe and William Hathorne. This land was   
then called &ldquo;Broad Field.&rdquo; On his estate, thus enlarged, Pickering, a few years afterwards, built a   
house, still standing. The estate has remained, or   
rather so much of it as was attached to the homestead,   
in that family to this day, and is now owned and   
occupied by John Pickering, Esq., son of the eminent   
scholar and philologist of that name, and grandson of   
Colonel Timothy Pickering, of Revolutionary fame, &mdash;   
the trusted friend of Washington.</p>   
<p>Emanuel Downing was the father of Sir George   
Downing, one of the first class that graduated at Harvard College, &mdash; a man of extraordinary talents and   
wonderful fortunes. After finishing his collegiate   
<pb n="047" id="vI047"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1090">   
<figDesc>Page 047.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
course, in 1642, he studied divinity, probably under the   
direction of Hugh Peters; went to the West Indies,   
acting as chaplain in the vessel; preached and received   
calls to settle in several places; went on to England;   
entered the parliamentary service as chaplain to a regiment; was rapidly drawn into notice, and promoted   
from point to point, until he became scoutmaster in Cromwell's army. This office seems to have   
combined the functions of inspector and commissary, and head of the reconnoitering department.   
In 1654, he was married to Frances, sister of Viscount   
Morpeth, afterwards Earl of Carlisle; thus uniting   
himself with &ldquo;the blood of all the Howards,&rdquo; one of   
the noblest families in England. The nuptials were   
celebrated with great pomp, an epithalamium in Latin,   
&amp;c. All this, within eleven years after he took his   
degree at Harvard, is surely an extraordinary instance   
of rising in the world. He was a member of Parliament for Scotland. Cromwell sent him to France on   
diplomatic business, and his correspondence in Latin   
from that court was the beginning of a career of great   
services in that line. He was soon commissioned ambassador to the Hague, then the great court in Europe.   
Thurlow's state papers show with what marvellous vigilance, activity, and efficiency he conducted, from that   
centre, the diplomatic affairs of the commonwealth.   
At the restoration of the monarchy, he made the quickest and the loftiest somersault in all political history.   
It was done between two days. He saw Charles the   
Second at the Hague, on his way to England to resume   
<pb n="048" id="vI048"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1091">   
<figDesc>Page 048.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
his crown: and the man who, up to that moment, had been one of the most zealous supporters of   
the commonwealth, came out next morning as an   
equally zealous supporter of the king. He accompanied this wonderful exploit by an act of treachery to   
three of his old associates, &mdash; including Colonel Oakey,   
in whose regiment he had served as chaplain, &mdash; which   
cost them their lives. He was forthwith knighted,   
and his commission as ambassador renewed. After a   
while, he returned to England; went into Parliament   
from Morpeth, and ever after the exchequer was in   
his hands. By his knowledge, skill, and ability, he   
enlarged the financial resources of the country, multiplied its manufactures, and extended its power and   
wealth. He was probably the original contriver of   
the policy enforced in the celebrated Navigation Act,   
having suggested it in Cromwell's time. By that single short act of Parliament, England became the great   
naval power of the world; her colonial possessions,   
however widely dispersed, were consolidated into one   
vast fountain of wealth to the imperial realm; the   
empire of the seas was fixed on an immovable basis,   
and the proud Hollander compelled to take down the   
besom from the mast-head of his high-admiral.</p>   
<p>Sir George Downing did one thing in favor of the   
power of the people, in the British system of government, which may mitigate the resentment of mankind   
for his execrable seizure and delivery to the royal   
vengeance of Oakey, Corbett, and Barkstead. He   
introduced into Parliament and established the principle   
<pb n="049" id="vI049"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1092">   
<figDesc>Page 049.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of Specific Appropriations. The House of Commons has, ever since, not only held the keys of the   
treasury, but the power of controlling expenditures.   
The fortune of Sir George, on the failure of issue in   
the third generation, went to the foundation of Downing College, in Cambridge, England. It amounted to   
one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. It is   
not improbable, that Downing Street, in London, owes   
its name to the great diplomatist.</p>   
<p>This remarkable man spent his later youth and   
opening manhood on Salem Farms. In his college   
vacations and intervals of study, he partook, perhaps,   
in the labors of the plantation, mingled with the rural   
population, and shared in their sports. The crack of   
his fowling-piece re-echoed through the wild woods   
beyond Procter's Corner; he tended his father's duck at Humphries' Pond, and angled along the clear   
brooks. It is an observable circumstance, as illustrating the transmission of family traits, that the same   
ingenious activity and versatility of mind, which led   
Emanuel Downing, while carrying on the multifarious   
operations of opening a large farm in the forest, presiding in the local court at Salem, and serving year   
after year in the General Court as a deputy, to contrive complicated machinery for taking wild fowl and   
getting up distilleries, re-appeared in his son, on the   
broader field of the manufactures, finances, and foreign relations of a great nation.</p>   
<p>A tract of three hundred acres, next eastward of   
the Downing farm, was granted to Thomas Read. He   
<pb n="050" id="vI050"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1093">   
<figDesc>Page 050.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
became a freeman in 1634, was a member of the   
Salem Church in 1636, received his grant the same   
year, and was acknowledged as an inhabitant, May   
2, 1637. The farm is now occupied and owned by   
the Hon. Richard S. Rogers. It is a beautiful and   
commanding situation, and attests the taste of its   
original proprietor. Mr. Read seems to have had a   
passion for military affairs. In 1636, he was ensign   
in a regiment composed of men from Saugus, Ipswich,   
Newbury, and Salem, of which John Endicott was   
colonel, and John Winthrop, Jr., lieutenant-colonel.   
In 1647, he commanded a company. During the civil   
wars in England, he was attracted back to his native   
country. He commanded a regiment in 1660, and held   
his place after the Restoration. He died about 1663.</p>   
<p>Our antiquarians were long at a loss to understand a sentence in one of Roger Williams's letters to   
John Winthrop, Jr., in which he says, &ldquo;Sir, you were   
not long since the son of two noble fathers, Mr. John   
Winthrop and Mr. Hugh Peters.&rdquo; How John Winthrop,   
Jr., could be a son of Hugh Peters was the puzzle.   
Peters was not the father of either of Winthrop's two   
wives; and there was nothing in any family records   
or memorials to justify the notion. On the contrary,   
they absolutely precluded it. By the labors and acumen of the Hon. James Savage and Mr. Charles Deane,   
of Cambridge, who have no superiors in grappling with   
such a difficulty, its solution seems, at last, to be   
reached. &ldquo;After long fruitless search,&rdquo; Mr. Savage   
has expressed a conviction that Mr. Deane has &ldquo;acquired   
<pb n="051" id="vI051"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1094">   
<figDesc>Page 051.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the probable explication.&rdquo; The clue was thus   
obtained: Mr. Savage says, &ldquo;This approach to explanation is gained from `the Life and Death of Hugh   
Peters, by William Yonge, Dr. Med. London. 1663,'   
a very curious and more scarce tract.&rdquo; The facts discovered are that Peters taught a free school at Maldon,   
in Essex; and that a widow lady with children and an   
estate of two or three hundred pounds a year befriended him. She was known as &ldquo;Mistress Read.&rdquo;   
Peters married her. The second wife of John Winthrop, Jr., was Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel Read,   
of Essex. By marrying Mrs. Read, Peters became the   
step-father of the younger Winthrop's wife; and, by   
the usage of that day, he would be called Winthrop's   
father.</p>   
<p>A few additional particulars, in reference to Peters   
and our Salem Read, may shed further light on the   
subject. While a prisoner in the Tower of London,   
awaiting the trial which, in a few short days, consigned him to his fate, Peters wrote &ldquo;A Dying Father's   
Last Legacy to an only Child,&rdquo; and delivered it to his   
daughter just before his execution. This is one of the   
most admirable productions of genius, wisdom, and   
affection, anywhere to be found. In it he gives a   
condensed history of his life, which enables us to settle   
some questions, which have given rise to conflicting   
statements, and kept some points in his biography in   
obscurity. In the first place, the title proves that he   
had, at the time of his death, no other child. In the   
course of it, he tells his daughter, that, when he was   
<pb n="052" id="vI052"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1095">   
<figDesc>Page 052.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
fourteen years of age, his mother, then a widow, removed with him to Cambridge, and connected him   
with the University there. His elder brother had   
been sent to Oxford for his education. After residing   
eight years in Cambridge, he took his Master's degree,   
and then went up to London, where he was &ldquo;struck   
with the sense of his sinful estate by a sermon he   
heard under Paul's, which was about forty years since,   
which text was the <hi rend="italics">burden of Dumah or Idumea,</hi> and   
stuck fast. This made me to go into Essex; and after   
being quieted by another sermon in that country, and   
the love and labors of Mr. Thomas Hooker, I there   
preached, there married with a good gentlewoman, till   
I went to London to ripen my studies, not intending   
to preach at all.&rdquo; He then relates the circumstances   
which subsequently led him again to engage in preaching. He is stated to have been born in 1599: his   
death was in 1660. Putting together these dates and   
facts, it becomes evident that he could not have been   
more than twenty-two years of age when he married   
&ldquo;Mistress Read.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Last Legacy&rdquo; shows, not   
merely in the manner in which he speaks of her, &mdash;   
&ldquo;a good gentlewoman,&rdquo; &mdash; but, in its express terms,   
that she was not the mother of the &ldquo;only child&rdquo; to   
whom it was addressed. &ldquo;Besides your mother,&rdquo; he   
states that he had had &ldquo;a godly wife before.&rdquo; There   
is no indication that there were children by the earlier   
marriage. If there were, they died young. He married, for his second wife, Deliverance Sheffield, at   
Boston, in March, 1639.</p>

had left the children by her former husband in his   
hands and under his care. He evidently cherished   
the memory of the &ldquo;good gentlewoman of Essex&rdquo;   
with the tenderest and most sacred affection. She   
had not only been the dear wife of his youth, but her   
property placed him above want. No wonder that the   
strongest attachment existed between him and her   
children. John Winthrop, Jr., and his wife, called   
him father, not merely in conformity with custom,   
being their step-father in point of fact, but with the   
fondness and devotion of actual children. It was on   
account of this intimate and endeared connection,   
and in consideration of the pecuniary benefit he had   
derived from his marriage to the mother of the younger   
Winthrop's wife, that he made arrangements, in case   
he should not return to America, that his Salem   
property should go to her and her husband. Having   
married a second wife, and there being issue of said   
marriage, he would not have alienated so considerable   
a part of his property from the legal heir without   
some good and sufficient reason. The foregoing view   
of the case explains the whole. The solution of the   
mystery which had enveloped Roger Williams's language is complete. Elizabeth, the daughter of the   
second marriage, to whom the &ldquo;Last Legacy&rdquo; was   
addressed, was baptized in the First Church at Salem,   
on the 8th of March, 1640. It does not appear,   
that, during her subsequent life, there was any intimacy, or even acquaintance, between her and the   
<pb n="054" id="vI054"/>

<figDesc>Page 054.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Winthrops, as there was no ground for it, she being in   
no way connected with them.</p>   
<p>May not Thomas Read, of Salem, have been a   
son of Colonel Read, of Maldon in Essex, and   
a brother of the wife of the younger Winthrop?   
Peters says, in the &ldquo;Last Legacy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Many of my   
acquaintances, going for New England, had engaged   
me to come to them when they sent, which accordingly I did.&rdquo; Thomas Read came over some time   
before him; so did John Winthrop, Jr., and wife.   
They were the same as children to him. They sent   
for him, and he came. After it was ascertained and   
determined that Peters should settle in Salem, Read   
joined the church here, and became a full inhabitant.   
Peters located his grant of land in sight of Read's residence, on the next then unappropriated territory, at a   
distance of about two and a half miles. When Read   
returned to England, he left his property here in   
the care of the Winthrops. Wait Winthrop, as the   
agent and attorney of his heirs, sold it to Daniel Eppes.   
If, as I conjecture, Thomas Read was a son of Colonel   
Read, of Essex, his coming here with Peters, and his   
connection with the Winthrops, are accounted for.   
His strong predilection for military affairs was natural   
in a son of a colonel of the English army. It led him   
back to the mother-country, on the first sound of the   
great civil war reaching these shores, and raised him   
to the rank he finally attained. The conjecture that   
he was a brother of the wife of the younger Winthrop   
is favored by the fact, that her son, Fitz John Winthrop,   
<pb n="055" id="vI055"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1098">   
<figDesc>Page 055.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was a captain in Read's regiment, at the time   
of the restoration of the Stuarts.</p>   
<p>During the short period of the residence of Hugh   
Peters in America, professional duties, and the extent   
to which his great talents were called upon in ecclesiastical and political affairs, in all parts of the colony,   
left him but little opportunity to attend to his twohundred grant. It was to the north of the   
present village of Danvers Plains, on the eastern side   
and adjoining to Frost-Fish Brook. The history of   
this grant confirms the supposition of his particular   
connection with the family of the younger Winthrop.   
It seems that it had not been formally laid out by   
metes and bounds while Peters was here. Owing to   
this circumstance, perhaps, it escaped confiscation at   
the time of his condemnation and execution. Some   
years afterwards, June 4, 1674, a committee of the   
town laid out the grant &ldquo;to Mr. Peters.&rdquo; The record   
of this transaction says, &ldquo;The land is in the possession   
of John Corwin.&rdquo; Captain John Corwin had married,   
in May, 1665, Margaret, daughter of John Winthrop,   
Jr. She survived her husband, and sold the same   
land, May 22, 1693, to &ldquo;Henry Brown, Jr., of Salisbury, yeoman.&rdquo; These facts show that this portion of   
Mr. Peters's lands did go, according to the agreement   
when he left America, to the family of John Winthrop, Jr.</p>   
<p>Whether he had erected a house on this grant is not   
known. From his characteristic energy, activity, and   
promptitude, it is probable that he had begun to clear   
<pb n="056" id="vI056"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1099">   
<figDesc>Page 056.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
it. In agriculture, as in every thing else, he gave a   
decisive impulse. It is stated that he had a particular   
design to attempt the culture of hemp. He introduced   
many implements of labor, and started new methods   
of improvement. He disclosed to the producer of agricultural growths the idea of raising what the land   
was most capable of yielding in abundance, in greater   
quantities than were needed for local consumption, and   
finding for the surplus an outside market. He is allowed to have introduced the coasting and foreign   
trade on an intelligent and organized basis, and to   
have promoted ship-building and the export of the   
products of the forests and the fields generally to   
the Southern plantations, the West Indies, and even   
more distant points. If he had remained longer   
in the country, the farming interests, and the settlers in   
what was afterwards called Salem Village, within   
which his tract was situated, would have felt his great   
influence. As it was, he undoubtedly did much to inspire a zeal for improvement. His town residence was   
on the south-western corner of Essex and Washington   
Street, then known as &ldquo;Salem Corner,&rdquo; where the   
office of the Horse-railroad Company now is. The lot   
was a quarter of an acre. Roger Williams probably   
had resided there, and sold to Peters, who was his   
successor in the ministry of the First Church, and   
whose attorney sold it to Benjamin Felton, in 1659.   
The range of ground included within what are now   
Washington, Essex, Summer, and Chestnut Streets,   
and extending to the South River, as it was before any   
<pb n="057" id="vI057"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1100">   
<figDesc>Page 057.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
dam or mills had been erected over or across it, was a   
beautiful swell of land, with sloping surfaces, intersected by a creek from near the foot of Chestnut Street   
to its junction with the South River under the present   
grade of Mill Street. To the south of the corner, occupied successively by Roger Williams and Hugh Peters,   
Ralph Fogg, the Lady Deborah Moody, George Corwin,   
Dr. George Emory, Thomas Ruck, Samuel Skelton,   
Endicott, Pickering, Downing, and Hathorne, each   
had lots, extending in order to the foot of what is now   
Phelps Street. Most, if not all of them, had houses   
on their lots. Elder Sharp had what was called   
&ldquo;Sharp's Field,&rdquo; bordering on the north side of Essex   
Street, extending from Washington to North Streets.   
His house was at the north corner of Lynde and Washington Streets. Edmund Batter, Henry Cook, Dr.   
Daniel Weld, Stephen Sewall, and Edward Norris,   
were afterwards on his land. Hugh Peters also   
owned the lot, consisting of a quarter of an acre, on   
the north-eastern corner of Essex and Washington   
Streets, now occupied by what is known as Stearns's   
Building, and was preparing to erect a house upon it   
when he was sent to England. His attorney sold it, in   
1652, to John Orne, the founder of the family of that   
name.</p>   
<p>The daughter of Mr. Peters came over to America   
shortly after his death, bringing with her her mother,   
who, for many years, had been subject to derangement. They were kindly received; and some of his   
property, particularly a valuable farm in the vicinity   
<pb n="058" id="vI058"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1101">   
<figDesc>Page 058.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of Marblehead, which the daughter sold to the American ancestor of the Devereux family, was recovered   
from the effect of his attainder. She probably soon   
went back to England, where she spent her days.   
Papers on file in the county court show that Elizabeth   
Barker, widow, &ldquo;daughter of Mr. Hugh Peters,&rdquo; was   
living, in March, 1702, in good health, at Deptford,   
Kent, in the immediate vicinity of London, and had   
been living there for about forty years.</p>   
<p>In consequence, perhaps, of the intimate connection   
between Mr. Peters and the family of John Winthrop,   
Jr., the name of the latter is to be added to the cluster   
of eminent men who, at that time, were drawn to   
reside in Salem. He was here, it is quite certain,   
from 1638 to 1641, if not for a longer period. There   
are indications of his presence as early as March of   
the former year, when he was appointed with Endicott   
to administer the freeman's oath to his uncle Downing.   
On the 25th of the next June, he had liberty to set   
up a salt-house at Royal Neck, on the east side of   
Wooleston River. There he erected a dwelling-house   
and other buildings, as appears by the depositions of   
sundry persons in a land suit about thirty years afterwards, who state that they worked for him, and were   
conversant with him there for several years. His first   
experiments and enterprises in the salt-manufacture,   
which he subsequently conducted on a very extensive   
scale in Connecticut, were performed at Royal Neck.   
His daughter, the widow successively of Antipas   
Newman and Zerubabel Endicott, in the suit just mentioned,   
<pb n="059" id="vI059"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1102">   
<figDesc>Page 059.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
recovered possession of that property, comprising forty acres, with the buildings and improvements.   
In 1646, John Winthrop, Jr., accompanied by a brother   
of Hugh Peters, Rev. Thomas Peters from Cornwall   
in England, began a plantation at Pequot River; and   
Trumbull, in his &ldquo;History of Connecticut,&rdquo; says that   
&ldquo;Mr. Thomas Peters was the first minister of Saybrook.&rdquo; The fortunes and families of Hugh Peters   
and John Winthrop, Jr., seem all along to have been   
linked together.</p>   
<p>Downing, Read, and Peters, three of the original   
planters of Salem Farms, were drawn back to England   
and kept there by the engrossing interest which the   
wonderful revolution then breaking out in that kingdom could not but awaken in such minds as theirs.   
Here and everywhere, a great check was given to the   
early progress of the country by the turn of the tide   
which carried such men back to England, and prevented others from coming over. If the Parliament   
had not attempted to arrest the usurpations of the   
crown at that time, and the Stuarts been suffered to   
establish an absolute monarchy, the eyes and hearts   
of all free spirits would have remained fixed on   
America, and a perpetual stream of emigration brought   
over, for generations and for ever, thousands upon   
thousands of such men as came at the beginning.   
The effects that would have been thus produced in   
America and in England, in accelerating the progress   
of society here, and sinking it into debasement there;   
and thereby upon the fortunes of mankind the world   
<pb n="060" id="vI060"/>

<figDesc>Page 060.</figDesc>

over, is a subject on which a meditative and philosophical mind may well be exercised.</p>   
<p>But, although these men were lost, others are   
worthy of being enumerated, in forming an estimate   
of the elements that went to make the character of   
the people, a chapter in whose history, of awful import, we are preparing ourselves to explore.</p>   
<p>Francis Weston was a leading man at the very beginning. In 1634, with Roger Conant and John Holgrave, he represented Salem in the first House of Deputies ever assembled. His land grant was some little   
distance to the west of the meeting-house of the village. He must have been a person of more than   
ordinary liberality of spirit; for he discountenanced   
the intolerance of his age, and kept his mind open to   
receive truth and light. He did not conceal his sympathy with those who suffered for entertaining Antinomian sentiments. He was ordered to quit the colony   
in 1638. For the same offence, his wife, who probably   
had refused to go, was placed in the stocks &ldquo;two hours   
at Boston and two at Salem, on a lecture day.&rdquo; Weston, having ventured back, five years afterwards, was   
put in irons, and imprisoned to hard labor. But, as   
he stood to his principles, and there was danger to be   
apprehended from his influence, he was again driven   
out of the colony.</p>   
<p>Richard Waterman came over from England in   
1629, recommended to Governor Endicott by the governor and deputy in London. He was a noted hunter.   
&ldquo;His chief employment,&rdquo; says the letter introducing   
<pb n="061" id="vI061"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1104">   
<figDesc>Page 061.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
him to Endicott, &ldquo;will be to get you good venison.&rdquo;   
A land grant was assigned him near Davenport's Hill.   
But he, too, had a spirit that resisted the severe and   
arbitrary policy of the times. He became a dissenter   
from the prevalent creed, and sympathized with those   
who suffered oppression. In 1664, he was brought   
before the court, condemned to imprisonment, and   
finally banished. Weston and Waterman subsequently were conspicuous in Rhode-Island affairs.   
While residing in the village, the latter probably devoted himself to the opening of his land, and the pursuit of game through the forests. I find but one   
notice of him as connected with public affairs.</p>   
</div2>  
<div2 type="Section" n="2">

<div3 type="segment">  
<p>For some years, the settlements were necessarily   
confined to the shores of bays or coves, and the banks   
of rivers. There were no wheel-carriages of any kind,   
for transportation or travel, until something like roads   
could be made; and that was the work of time. A   
few horses had been imported; but it was long before   
they could be raised to meet the general wants, or come   
much into use. Every thing had to be water-borne.   
The only vehicles were boats or canoes, mostly the   
latter. There were two kinds of canoes. Large whitepine logs were scooped or hollowed out, and wrought   
into suitable shape, about two and a half feet in   
breadth and twenty in length. These were often   
quite convenient and serviceable, but not to be compared with the Indian canoes, which were made of   
the bark of trees, wrought with great skill into a beautiful shape. The birch canoe was an admirable structure,   
<pb n="062" id="vI062"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1105">   
<figDesc>Page 062.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
combining elements and principles which modern   
naval architecture may well study to imitate. In lightness, rapidity, freedom and ease of motion, it has not   
been, and cannot be, surpassed. Its draft, even when   
bearing a considerable burden, was so slight, that it   
would glide over the shallowest bars. It was strong,   
durable, and easily kept in repair. Although dangerous to the highest degree under an inexperienced and   
unskilful hand, no vessel has ever been safer when   
managed by persons trained to its use. The cool and   
quick-sighted Indian could guide it, with his exquisitely   
moulded paddle, in perfect security, through whirling   
rapids and over heavy seas, around headlands and   
across bays. The settlers early supplied themselves   
with canoes, by which to thread the interior streams,   
and cross from shore to shore in the harbors. One   
great advantage of the light canoe, before roads were   
opened through the woods, was, that it could be unloaded, and borne on the shoulders across the land, at   
any point, to another stream or lake, thus cutting off   
long curves, and getting from river to river. The   
lading would be transported in convenient parcels,   
the canoe launched, loaded, and again be floated on its   
way. Canoes soon came into universal use, particularly in this neighborhood. Wood, in his &ldquo;New Prospect,&rdquo; speaking of Salem, says, &ldquo;There   
be more canowes in this town than in all the whole   
Patent, every household having a water horse or two.&rdquo;   
It was so important for the public safety to have them   
kept in good condition, that the town took the matter   
<pb n="063" id="vI063"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1106">   
<figDesc>Page 063.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in hand. The quarterly court records have the following entry under the date of June 27, 1636: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;It was ordered and agreed, that all the canoes of the   
north side of the town shall be brought the next second day,   
being the 4th day of the 5th month, about 9 o'clock, A.M.,   
unto the cove of the common landing place of the North   
River, by George Harris his house &mdash; And that all the   
canoes of the south side are to be brought before the porthouse in the South River, at the same time, then and there to   
be viewed by J. Holgrave, P. Palfrey, R. Waterman, R.   
Conant, P. Veren, or the greater number of them. And   
that there shall be no canoe used (upon penalty, of forty shillings, to the owner thereof) than such as the said surveyors   
shall allow of and set their mark upon; and if any shall   
refuse or neglect to bring their canoes to the said places at   
the time appointed, they shall pay for said fault 10 shillings.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The names of the men associated with Waterman   
prove that he was ranked among the chief citizens of   
the town. The austere manners of the age, among   
communities like that established here; the exclusion,   
at that time, by inexorable laws, of many forms of   
amusement; and the general sombre aspect of society,   
kept down the natural exhilaration of life to such a   
degree, that, when the pressure was occasionally removed, the whole people bounded into the liveliest   
outbursts of glad excitement. It was no doubt a gala   
day. Ceremony, sport, and festivity, in all their   
forms, took full effect. The surveyors performed their   
functions with the utmost display of authority, examined the canoes with the gravest scrutiny, and affixed   
<pb n="064" id="vI064"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1107">   
<figDesc>Page 064.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
their marks with all due formality. A light, graceful,   
and most picturesque fleet swarmed, from all directions, to the appointed rendezvous. The harbor glittered with the flashing paddles, and was the scene of   
swift races and rival feats of skill, displaying manly   
strength and agility. It must have been an aquatic   
spectacle of rare gayety and beauty, not surpassed nor   
equalled in some respects, when, more than a century   
afterwards, the &ldquo;Grand Turk&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Essex&rdquo; frigate   
was launched, or when Commodore Forbes, still later,   
swept into our peaceful waters with his boat flotilla. It   
was the first Fourth of July ever celebrated in America.</p>   
<p>Thomas Scruggs was an early inhabitant of Salem;   
often represented the town as deputy in the General   
Court; was one of the judges of the local court, and   
always recognized among the rulers of the town. In   
January, 1636, he received a grant of three hundred   
acres on the south-west limits of its territory. The   
next month, an exchange took place, which is thus   
recorded in the town-book of grants: &ldquo;It was ordered,   
that, whereas Mr. Scruggs had a farm of three hundred acres beyond Forest River, and that Captain   
Trask had one of two hundred acres beyond Bass   
River, and Captain Trask freely relinquishing his farm   
of two hundred acres, it was granted unto Mr. Thomas   
Scruggs, and he thereupon freely relinquished his farm   
of three hundred acres.&rdquo; This brought Scruggs upon   
the Salem Farms, between Bass River and the great   
pond, Wenham Lake. The real object in making this   
arrangement was to advance a project which the leading   
<pb n="065" id="vI065"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1108">   
<figDesc>Page 065.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
people of Salem at that time had much at heart.   
They were very desirous to have the college established on the tract relinquished by Scruggs. What   
would have been the effect of placing it there, in the   
immediate neighborhood of the sea-shore, in full view   
of the spacious bay, its promontories, islands, and   
navigation, is a question on which we may speculate   
at our leisure. The effort failed: Captain Trask and   
Mr. Scruggs had done all they could to accomplish it,   
and gave their energies to the welfare of the community in other directions. From the little that is recorded of Scruggs, it is quite evident that he was   
an intelligent and valuable citizen. The event that   
brought his career as a public man to a close proves   
that his mind was enlightened, liberal, and independent; that he was in advance of the times in which he   
lived. When the bitter and violent persecution of the   
celebrated Anne Hutchinson, on account of her Antinomian sentiments, took place, Mr. Scruggs disapproved and denounced it. He gave his whole influence,   
earnestly and openly, against such attempts to suppress freedom of inquiry and the rights of conscience. He, with others in Salem, was proscribed,   
disarmed, and deprived of his public functions. He   
appears to have been suffered to remain unmolested   
on his estate, and died there in 1654. He had but one   
child, Rachel; and the name, as derived from him,   
became extinct. The inventory of his property is   
dated on the 24th of June of that year. The items   
mentioned in it amount to &pound;244. 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 2<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> Considering   
<pb n="066" id="vI066"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1109">   
<figDesc>Page 066.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the rates of value at that time, it was a large property. At the same date, an agreement is recorded by   
which his widow, Margery, conveys to her son-in-law,   
John Raymond, all her real estate, upon these conditions: She to have the use of her house during her   
life, the bedding, and other &ldquo;household stuff;&rdquo; and he   
to pay her five pounds &ldquo;in hand,&rdquo; twenty pounds per   
annum, and five pounds &ldquo;at the hour of her death.&rdquo;   
This was an ample provision, in those times, for her comfort while she lived, and for her funeral charges. I do   
not remember to have found this last point arranged   
for, in such a form of expression, in any other instance.</p>   
<p>William Alford was an early settler. He was a   
member of the numerous and wealthy society, or   
guild, of Skinners, in the city of London, and probably came here with the view of establishing an extensive trade in furs. He received accordingly, in 1636,   
a grant of two hundred acres, including what was for   
some time called Alford's Hill, afterwards Long Hill,   
now known as Cherry Hill. It is owned and occupied   
by R. P. Waters, Esq. Alford sympathized in religious views with his neighbor Scruggs, and with him   
was subjected to censure, and disarmed by order of   
the General Court. He sold his lands to Henry Herrick, and left the jurisdiction.</p>   
<p>One of the most enlightened, and perhaps most   
accomplished, men among the first inhabitants of Salem Village, was Townsend Bishop. He was admitted   
a freeman in 1635. The next year, he appears on the   
list of members of the Salem Church. He was one   
<pb n="067" id="vI067"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1110">   
<figDesc>Page 067.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of the judges of the local court, and, almost without   
intermission from his first coming here, a deputy to   
the General Court. In 1645, as his attention had been   
led to the subject, he conceived doubts in reference to   
infant baptism; and it was noticed that he did not   
bring forward a child, recently born, to the rite.   
Although himself on the bench, and ever before the object of popular favor and public honors, he was at once   
brought up, and handed over for discipline. The next   
year, he sold his estates, and probably removed elsewhere. He appears no more in our annals. Where   
he went, I have not been able to learn. It is to be   
hoped that he found somewhere a more congenial   
and tolerant abode. It is evident that he could not   
breathe in an atmosphere of bigotry; and it was difficult to find one free from the miasma in those days.</p>   
<p>Five of the most valuable of the first settlers of the   
village &mdash; Weston, Waterman, Seruggs, Alford, and   
Bishop &mdash; were thus early driven into exile, or subdued to silence, by the stern policy on which the colony was founded. It is an error to characterize this   
as religious bigotry. It was not so much a theological   
as a political persecution. Its apparent form was in   
reference to tenets of faith, but the policy was deeper   
than this. Any attempt to make opposition to the existing administration was treated with equal severity,   
whatever might be the subject on which it ventured to   
display itself.</p>   
<p>The men who sought this far-off &ldquo;nook and corner   
of the world,&rdquo; crossing a tempestuous and dangerous

</figure>   
ocean, and landing on the shores of a wilderness, leaving every thing, however dear and valuable, behind,   
came to have a country and a social system for themselves and of themselves alone. Their resolve was   
inexorable not to allow the mother-country, or the   
whole outside world combined, to interfere with them.   
And it was equally inexorable not to suffer dissent or   
any discordant element to get foothold among them.   
Sir Christopher Gardner's rank and title could not   
save him: he was not of the sort they wanted, and   
they shipped him back. Roger Williams's virtues,   
learning, apostolic piety, could not save him; and they   
drove him into a wintry wilderness, hunting him   
beyond their borders. It was not so much a question   
whether Baptists, Antinomians, or Quakers were right or   
wrong, as a preformed determination not to have any   
dissentients of any description among them. They had   
sacrificed all to find and to make a country for themselves, and they meant to keep it to themselves. They   
had gone out of everybody else's way, and they did   
not mean to let anybody else come into their way.   
They did not understand the great truth which Hugh   
Peters preached to Parliament, &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cannot Christians differ, and yet be friends? All children   
should be fed, though they have different faces and   
shapes: unity, not uniformity, is the Christian word.&rdquo;   
They admitted no such notion as this. They thought   
uniformity the only basis of unity. They meant to   
make and to keep this a country after their own pattern, a Congregational, Puritan, Cambridge

country. The time has not yet come when we   
can lift up clean hands against them. Two successive   
chief-magistrates of the United States have opened the   
door and signified to one-eighth part of our whole   
people, that it will be best for them to walk out. So   
long as the doctrine is maintained that this is the white   
man's country, or any man's, or any class or kind of   
men's country, it becomes us to close our lips against   
denunciation of the Fathers of New England because   
they tried to keep the country to themselves. The   
sentiment or notion on which they acted, in whatever   
form it appears, however high the station from which   
it emanates, or however long it lasts in the world, is   
equally false and detestable in all its shapes. It is   
a defiant rebellion against that law which declares that   
&ldquo;all nature's difference is all nature's peace;&rdquo; that   
there can be no harmony without variety of sound,   
no social unity without unlimited freedom, and no true   
liberty where any are deprived of equal rights; that   
differences ought to bring men together, rather than   
keep them apart; and that the only government that   
can stand against the shocks of time, and grow stronger   
and dearer to all its people, is one that recognizes no   
differences of whatever kind among them. The only   
consistent or solid foundation on which a republic or   
a church can be built, is an absolute level, with no   
enclosures and no exclusion.</p>   
<p>Townsend Bishop's grant of three hundred acres   
was made on the 16th of January, 1636. When he   
sold it, Oct. 18, 1641, it appears by the deed, that there   
<pb n="070" id="vI070"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1113">   
<figDesc>Page 070.</figDesc>

were on it edifices, gardens, yards, enclosures, and   
meadows. A large force must have been put and kept   
upon it, from the first, to have produced such results   
in so short a time. Orchards had been planted. The   
manner in which the grounds were laid out is still   
indicated by embankments, with artificial slopes and   
roadways, which exhibit the fine taste of the proprietor, and must have required a large expenditure of   
money and labor. Although the estate has always   
been in the hands of owners competent to take care   
of it and keep it in good preservation, none but the   
original proprietor would have been likely to have   
made the outlay apparent on its face, on the plan   
adopted. The mansion in which he resided stands to. Its front, facing the south, has apparently been   
widened, at some remote intermediate date since its   
original erection, by a slight extension on the western   
end, beyond the porch. It has been otherwise, perhaps, somewhat altered in the course of time by repairs; but its general aspect, as exhibited in the frontispiece of this volume, and its original strongly compacted and imperishable frame, remain. No saw was   
used in shaping its timbers; they were all hewn, by   
the broad-axe, of the most durable oak: they are   
massive, and rendered by time as hard to penetrate   
almost as iron. The walls and stairway of the cellar,   
the entrance to which is seen by the side of the porch,   
constructed of such stones as could be gathered on the   
surface of a new country, bear the marks of great antiquity. A long, low kitchen, with a stud of scarcely   
<pb n="071" id="vI071"/>

<figDesc>Page 071.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
six feet, extended originally the whole length of the   
lean-to, on the north side of the house. The rooms of   
the main house were of considerably higher stud.   
The old roadway, the outlines of which still remain,   
approached the house from the east, came up to its   
north-east corner, wound round its front, and continued   
from its north-west corner, on a track still visible, over   
a brook and through the apple-orchard planted by   
Bishop, to the point where the burial-ground of the   
village now is; and so on towards the lands then occupied by Richard Hutchinson, also to the lands afterwards owned by Nathaniel Ingersol, towards Beaver   
Dam, and the first settlements in that direction and to   
the westward. In general it may be said, that the   
structural proportions and internal arrangements of   
the house, taken in its relations to the vestiges and   
indications on the face of the grounds, show that it is   
coeval with the first occupancy of the farm. But we   
do not depend, in this case, upon conjectural considerations, or on mere tradition, which, on such a point,   
is not always reliable. It happens to be demonstrated,   
that this is the veritable house built and occupied by   
Townsend Bishop, in 1636, by a singular and irrefragable chain of specific proof. A protracted land suit,   
hereafter to be described, gave rise to a great mass of   
papers, which are preserved in the files of the county   
courts and the State Department; among them are   
several plots made by surveyors, and adduced in evidence by the parties. Not only the locality but a   
diagram of the house, as then standing, are given.   
<pb n="072" id="vI072"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1115">   
<figDesc>Page 072.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
The spot on which it stood is shown. Further, it   
appears, that, in the deeds of transference of the   
estate, the homestead is specially described as the   
house in which Townsend Bishop lived, called &ldquo;Bishop Mansion.&rdquo; This continues to a period subsequent to the style of its architecture, and within   
recent tradition and the memory of the living. In the   
old Salem Commoner's records, it is called &ldquo;Bishop's   
Cottage,&rdquo; which was the name generally given to   
dwelling-houses in those early times. Having, as   
occasion required, been seasonably repaired, it is as   
strong and good a house to-day as can be found. Its   
original timbers, if kept dry and well aired, are beyond decay; and it may stand, a useful, eligible, and   
comely residence, through a future as long as the past.   
It may be doubted whether any dwelling-house now   
in use in this country can be carried back, by any   
thing like a similar strength of evidence, to an equal   
antiquity. Its site, in reference to the surrounding   
landscape, was well chosen. Here its hospitable and   
distinguished first proprietor lived, in the interims of   
his public and official service, in peace and tranquillity,   
until ferreted out by the intrusive spirit of an intolerant age. Here he welcomed his neighbors, &mdash; Endicott,   
Downing, Peters, John Winthrop, Jr., Read, and   
other kindred spirits.<note target="v1n1">*</note></p>

by its connection with the darkest scene in our   
annals. As that scene cannot otherwise be comprehended in all the elements that led to it, it is necessary to give the intermediate history of the Townsend   
Bishop farm and mansion. In 1641, Bishop sold it to   
Henry Chickering, who seems to have been residing for   
some time in Salem, and to whom, in January, 1640,   
a grant of land had been made by the town. He continued to own it until the 4th of October, 1648; although he does not appear to have resided on the farm   
long, as he soon removed to Dedham, from which   
place he was deputy to the General Court in 1642,   
and several years afterwards. He sold the farm at   
the above-mentioned date to Governor Endicott for   
one hundred and sixty pounds. In 1653, John Endiott, Jr., the eldest son of the Governor, married   
Elizabeth, daughter of Jeremiah Houchins, an eminent citizen of Boston, who had before resided in   
Hingham, which place he represented as deputy for   
six years. The name was pronounced &ldquo;Houkins,&rdquo;   
and so perhaps was finally spelled &ldquo;Hawkins.&rdquo; By   
agreement, or &ldquo;articles of marriage contract,&rdquo; Endicott bestowed the farm upon his son. &ldquo;Present   
possession&rdquo; was given. How long, or how much of   
the time, the young couple lived on the estate, is not   
known. Their principal residence was in Boston.   
The General Court, in 1660, granted John Endicott,   
<pb n="075" id="vI075"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1118">   
<figDesc>Page 075.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Jr., four hundred acres of land on the eastern side   
of the upper part of Merrimac River. After the   
purchase of the farm from Chickering, the Endicott   
property covered nearly a thousand acres in one tract,   
extending from the arms of the sea to the centre of   
the present village of Tapleyville. On the 10th   
of May, 1662, the Governor executed a deed, carrying   
out the engagements of the marriage contract, giving   
to his son John, his heirs, and assigns for ever, the   
Bishop farm. Governor Endicott died in 1665. A   
will was found signed and sealed by him, dated May   
2, 1659, in which, referring to the marriage gift to   
John, he bequeathes the aforesaid farm to &ldquo;him and   
his heirs,&rdquo; but does not add, &ldquo;and assigns.&rdquo; Another   
item of the will is, &ldquo;The land I have bequeathed to   
my two sons, in one place or another, my will is that   
the longest liver of them shall enjoy the whole, except   
the Lord send them children to inherit it after them.&rdquo;   
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses to the will.   
It was not allowed in Probate. The matter was carried up to the General Court; and it was decided   
Aug. 1, 1665, that the court &ldquo;do not approve of the   
instrument produced in court to be the last will and   
testament of the late John Endicott, Esq., governor.&rdquo;   
In October of the same year, John Endicott, Jr., petitioned the General Court to act on the settlement of   
his father's estate; and the court directs administration to be granted to &ldquo;Mrs. Elizabeth Endicott and her   
two sons, John and Zerubabel,&rdquo; and that they bring in   
an inventory to the next county court at Boston, and   
<pb n="076" id="vI076"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1119">   
<figDesc>Page 076.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to dispose of the same as the law directs. Upon this,   
the widow of the Governor, and his son Zerubabel,   
again appeal to the General Court; and on the 23d of   
May, 1666, &ldquo;after a full hearing of all parties concerned in the said estate, i.e., the said Mrs. Elizabeth   
Endicott and her two sons, Mr. John and Mr. Zerubabel Endicott, Mr. Jeremiah Houchin being also present   
in court, and respectively presenting their pleas and   
evidences in the case,&rdquo; it was finally decided and   
ordered by the court, that the provisions of the document purporting to be the will of Governor Endicott   
should be carried into effect, with these exceptions:   
that the Bishop or Chickering farm shall go to his son   
John &ldquo;to him, his heirs and assigns for ever;&rdquo; and   
that Elizabeth, the wife of said son John, if she   
should survive her husband, shall enjoy during her   
life all the estate of her husband in all the other   
houses and lands mentioned in the instrument purporting to be his father's will. The court adjudge   
that this must have been &ldquo;the real intent of the aforesaid John Endicott, Esq., deceased, who had during   
his life special favor and respect for her.&rdquo; They give   
the widow of the Governor &ldquo;the goods and chattels&rdquo;   
of the said John Endicott, Esq., her late husband, provided that, if &ldquo;she shall die seized to the value of   
more than eighty pounds sterling&rdquo; thereof, the surplus   
shall be divided between her two sons: John to have   
a double portion thereof. Finally, they appoint the   
widow sole administratrix, and require her to bring in   
a true inventory to the next court for the county of   
Suffolk, and to pay all debts.</p>   
<pb n="077" id="vI077"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1120">   
<figDesc>Page 077.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>John and his father-in-law had it all their own way.   
The decision of the court was perhaps correct, according to legal principles; although it is not so certain   
that it was, in all respects, in conformity with the   
intent of Governor Endicott. Undoubtedly, as the   
language of the deed shows, he had made up his mind   
to give to his son John and &ldquo;his assigns&rdquo; absolute, full,   
and final possession of the Bishop farm. But it seems   
equally certain, that he meant to have the rest of his   
landed estate, including the Orchard Farm and the   
Ipswich-river farm, go directly and wholly to the survivor, if either of his sons died without issue. The   
facts and dates are as follows: His son John was   
married in 1653. The Governor's will was made in   
1659. It had then become quite probable that John   
might not have issue. The will gives him and his   
heirs, but not his assigns, the Bishop farm. In the   
event of his death without issue, his widow would   
have her dower and legal life right in it, but the final   
heir would be Zerubabel. In 1662, the Governor,   
who had, some years before, removed to Boston, where   
he resided the remainder of his life, executed a deed,   
giving to his son John, &ldquo;his heirs and assigns,&rdquo; a full   
and permanent title to the Bishop farm. This was a   
variation of the plan for the disposition of his estate   
as shown in his will. He probably designed to make   
a new will, securing to his natural heirs, so far as his   
other landed property was concerned, what he had   
thus permitted to pass away from them in the Bishop   
farm; that is, the full and immediate possession by   
<pb n="078" id="vI078"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1121">   
<figDesc>Page 078.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the survivor, if either of the sons died without issue.   
It was a favorite idea, almost a sacred principle, in   
those days, to have lands go in the natural descent.   
The sentiment is quite apparent in the tenor of the   
Governor's will. When he deprived, by his deed to   
John in 1662, Zerubabel's family of the right to the   
final possession of the Bishop farm, it can hardly be   
doubted that he relied upon the provisions of his will   
to secure to them the immediate, complete possession   
of all his other lands, without the incumbrance of any   
claim of dower or otherwise of John's widow. But   
the pressure of public duties prevented his duly executing his will, and putting it into a new shape, in   
conformity with the circumstances of the case. The   
troubles that followed teach the necessity of the utmost caution and carefulness in that most difficult   
and most irremediable of all business transactions, &mdash;   
the attempt to continue the control of property, after   
death, by written instruments.</p>   
<p>John Endicott, Jr., died in February, 1668, without   
issue; leaving his whole estate to his widow, &ldquo;her   
heirs and assigns for ever.&rdquo; His will is dated Jan.   
27, 1668, and was offered to Probate on the 29th of   
February, 1668. His widow married, Aug. 31,   
1668, the Rev. James Allen, one of the ministers of   
the First Church in Boston, whose previous wife,   
Hannah Dummer, by whom he received five hundred   
acres of land, had died in March, 1668. His Endicott   
wife died April 5, 1673, leaving the Townsend farm and all her other property to him; and   
<pb n="079" id="vI079"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1122">   
<figDesc>Page 079.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
on the 11th of September, of the same year, he married Sarah Hawlins. By his two preceding wives he   
received twelve hundred acres of land. How much he   
got by the last-mentioned, we have no information.   
Besides these matrimonial accumulations, the accounts   
seem to indicate that he was rich before.</p>   
<p>It may well be imagined, that it could not have been   
very agreeable to the family at the Orchard Farm to see   
this choice and extensive portion of their estate, which   
was within full view from their windows, swept into   
the hands of utter strangers in so rapid and extraordinary a manner, by a series of circumstances most   
distasteful and provoking. But this was but the beginning of their trouble.</p>   
<p>On the 29th of April, 1678, Allen sold the Bishop   
farm to Francis Nurse, of the town of Salem, for four   
hundred pounds. Nurse was an early settler, and,   
before this purchase, had lived, for some forty years,   
&ldquo;near Skerry's,&rdquo; on the North River, between the   
main part of the settlement in the town of Salem and   
the ferry to Beverly. He is described as a &ldquo;tray.&rdquo; The making of these articles, and similar   
objects of domestic use, was an important employment   
in a new country remote from foreign supply. He appears to have been a very respectable person, of great   
stability and energy of character, whose judgment was   
much relied on by his neighbors. No one is mentioned more frequently as umpire to settle disputes, or   
arbitrator to adjust conflicting claims. He was often   
on committees to determine boundaries or estimate   
<pb n="080" id="vI080"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1123">   
<figDesc>Page 080.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
valuations, or on local juries to lay out highways and   
assess damages. The fact that he was willing to encounter the difficulties connected with such a heavy   
transaction as the purchase of the Bishop farm at   
such a price at his time of life proves that he had a   
spirit equal to a bold undertaking. He was then fifty years of age. His wife Rebecca was fifty-seven   
years of age. We shall meet her again.</p>   
<p>They had four sons, &mdash; Samuel, John, Francis, and   
Benjamin; and four daughters, &mdash; Rebecca, married to   
Thomas Preston, Mary to John Tarbell, Elizabeth to   
William Russell, and Sarah, who remained unmarried   
until after the death of her mother. With this strong   
force of stalwart sons and sons-in-law, and their industrious wives, Francis Nurse took hold of the farm.   
The terms of the purchase were so judicious and ingenious, that they are worthy of being related, and   
show in what manner energetic and able-bodied men,   
even if not possessed of capital, particularly if they   
could command an effective co-operation in the labor   
of their families, obtained possession of valuable   
landed estates. The purchase-money was not required   
to be paid until the expiration of twenty-one years.   
In the mean time, a moderate annual rent was fixed   
upon; seven pounds for each of the first twelve years,   
and ten pounds for each of the remaining nine years.   
If, at the end of the time, the amount stipulated had   
not been paid, or Nurse should abandon the undertaking, the property was to relapse to Allen. Disinterested and suitable men, whose appointment was   
<pb n="081" id="vI081"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1124">   
<figDesc>Page 081.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
provided for, were then to estimate the value added to   
the estate by Nurse during his occupancy, by the clearing of meadows or erection of buildings or other permanent improvements, and all of that value over and   
above one hundred and fifty pounds was to be paid to   
him. If any part of the principal sum should be paid   
prior to the expiration of twenty-one years, a proportionate part of the farm was to be relieved of all obligation to Allen, vest absolutely in Nurse, and be   
disposable by him. By these terms, Allen felt authorized to fix a very high price for the farm, it not being   
payable until the lapse of a long period of time. If not   
paid at all, the property would come back to him, with   
one hundred and fifty pounds of value added to it. It   
was not a bad bargain for him, &mdash; a man of independent   
means derived from other sources, and so situated as   
not to be able to carry on the farm himself. It was a   
good investment ahead. To Nurse the terms were   
most favorable. He did not have to pay down a dollar   
at the start. The low rent required enabled him to   
apply almost the entire income from the farm to improvements that would make it more and more   
productive. Before half the time had elapsed, a   
value was created competent to discharge the whole   
sum due to Allen. His children severally had good   
farms within the bounds of the estate, were able to   
assume with ease their respective shares of the obligations of the purchase; and the property was thus   
fully secured within the allotted time. Allen gave, at   
the beginning, a full deed, in the ordinary form, which   
<pb n="082" id="vI082"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1125">   
<figDesc>Page 082.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was recorded in this county. Nurse gave a duly executed bond, in which the foregoing conditions are carefully and clearly defined. That was recorded in Suffolk   
County; and nothing, perhaps, was known in the   
neighborhood, at the time or ever after, of the terms   
of the transaction. When the success of the enterprise was fully secured, Nurse conveyed to his children   
the larger half of the farm, reserving the homestead   
and a convenient amount of land in his own possession. The plan of this division shows great fairness   
and judgment, and was entirely satisfactory to them all.   
They were required, by the deeds he gave them, to   
maintain a roadway by which they could communicate   
with each other and with the old parental home.</p>   
<p>Here the venerable couple were living in truly patriarchal style, occupying the &ldquo;mansion&rdquo; of Townsend   
Bishop, when the witchcraft delusion occurred. They   
and their children were all clustered within the limits   
of the three-hundred-acre farm. They were one family.   
The territory was their own, secured by their united action, and made commodious, productive, valuable, and   
beautiful to behold, by their harmonious, patient,   
and persevering labor. Each family had a homestead,   
and fields and gardens; and children were growing up   
in every household. The elder sons and sons-in-law   
had become men of influence in the affairs of the   
church and village. It was a scene of domestic happiness and prosperity rarely surpassed. The work of   
life having been successfully done, it seemed that a   
peaceful and serene descent into the vale of years was   
<pb n="083" id="vI083"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1126">   
<figDesc>Page 083.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
secured to Francis and Rebecca Nurse. But far otherwise was the allotment of a dark and inscrutable providence.</p>   
<p>There is some reason to suspect that the prosperity   
of the Nurses had awakened envy and jealousy among   
the neighbors. The very fact that they were a community of themselves and by themselves, may have   
operated prejudicially. To have a man, who, for forty   
years, had been known, in the immediate vicinity, as a   
farmer and mechanic on a small scale, without any   
pecuniary means, get possession of such a property,   
and spread out his family to such an extent, was inexplicable to all, and not relished perhaps by some.   
There seems to have been a disposition to persist in   
withholding from him the dignity of a landholder;   
and, long after he had distributed his estate among his   
descendants, it is mentioned in deeds made by parties   
that bounded upon it, as &ldquo;the farm which Mr. Allen,   
of Boston, lets to the Nurses.&rdquo; Not knowing probably   
any thing about it, they call it, even after Nurse's   
death, &ldquo;Mr. Allen's farm.&rdquo; This, however, was a   
slight matter. When Allen sold the farm to Nurse, he   
bound himself to defend the title; and he was true to   
his bond. What was required to be done in this direction may, perhaps, have exposed the Nurses to animosities which afterwards took terrible effect against them.</p>   
<p>In granting lands originally, neither the General   
Court nor the town exercised sufficient care to define   
boundaries. There does not appear to have been any   
well-arranged system, based upon elaborate, accurate,   
<pb n="084" id="vI084"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1127">   
<figDesc>Page 084.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
scientific surveys. Of the dimensions of the area of a   
rough, thickly wooded, unfrequented country, the best   
estimates of the most practised eyes, and measurements resting on mere exploration or perambulation,   
are very unreliable. The consequence was, that, in   
many cases, grants were found to overlap each other.   
This was the case with the Bishop farm; and soon   
after Nurse came into possession, and had begun to   
operate upon it, a conflict commenced; trespasses   
were complained of; suits were instituted; and one   
of the most memorable and obstinately contested landcontroversies known to our courts took place. In that   
controversy Nurse was not formally a principal. The   
case was between James Allen and Zerubabel Endicott, or between Allen and Nathaniel Putnam.</p>   
<p>An inspection of the map, at this point, will enable   
us to understand the grounds on which the suit was   
contested. The Orchard Farm was granted to Endicott, as has been stated, July 3, 1632, by the General   
Court. The grant states the bounds on the south   
and on the north to be two rivers; on the east,   
another river, into which they both flow; and, on the   
west, the mainland. Where this western line was to   
strike the rivers on the north and south is not specified; but the natural interpretation would seem to be,   
in the absence of any thing to the contrary, that it was   
to strike them at their respective heads. The evidence of all persons who were conversant with the   
premises during the life of the Governor as connected   
with the farm was unanimous and conclusive to   
<pb n="085" id="vI085"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1128">   
<figDesc>Page 085.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
this point; that is, that he and they always supposed that the west line was, as drawn on the map,   
from the head of one river to the head of the other;   
that the farm embraced all between them as far up as   
the tide set. It was objected, on the other side, that   
this made the farm much more than three hundred   
acres; but as an offset to that was the fact, that a   
considerable part of the area was swamp or marsh, not   
usually taken into the account in reckoning the extent   
of a grant, and the additional fact, that the language   
of the General Court in reference to quantity was   
not precise, &mdash; &ldquo;about&rdquo; three hundred acres. At the   
same date with the grant to Endicott, the General   
Court granted two hundred acres to Mr. Skelton,   
which tract is given on the map.</p>   
<p>As has been stated, the General Court conferred   
upon the towns the exclusive right to dispose of the   
lands within their limits, March 3, 1635. On the 10th   
of December of that year, the town of Salem granted   
to Robert Cole the tract of three hundred acres subsequently purchased by Emanuel Downing, which is   
indicated on the map. On the 11th of January, 1636,   
the grant of three hundred acres was made to Townsend Bishop. Its language is unfortunately obscure in   
some expressions; but it is clear, that the tract was to   
be four hundred rods in length, one hundred and   
twenty-four rods in width at the western end, and one   
hundred and sixteen rods at the eastern. At the   
north-east corner it was to meet the water or brook   
that separated it from the grant to Skelton; and it   
<pb n="086" id="vI086"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1129">   
<figDesc>Page 086.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was also to &ldquo;but&rdquo; upon, or touch, at the eastern end,   
the land granted to Endicott by the General Court.   
After the grant to Bishop, the town, from time to time,   
made grants to Stileman of land north of the Bishop   
grant. Stileman's grants adjoined Skelton's at the   
north-eastern corner of the Bishop farm. That part   
of Stileman's land had come into possession of Nathaniel Putnam, and the residue westwardly, together   
with the grant to Weston, into the possession of   
Hutchinson, Houlton, and Ingersol. Still further   
west, the town had made grants to Swinnerton. Their   
respective locations are given in the map. The point   
of difficulty which gave rise to litigation was this:   
The Bishop farm was required, by the terms of the   
grant, to be one hundred and sixteen rods wide at its   
eastern end. But there was no room for it. The   
requisite width could not be got without encroaching   
upon either Putnam or Endicott, or both. As Endicott stood upon an earlier title than that of Bishop,   
and from a higher authority, and Putnam upon a later   
title from an inferior authority, the court of trials   
might have disposed of the matter, at the opening, on   
that ground, and Putnam been left to suffer the encroachment. But it did not so decide; and the case   
went on. The struggle was between Endicott to push   
it north, and thereby save his Orchard Farm, and   
the land between it and the Bishop grant, given by the   
town to his father, called the Governor's Plain, and   
Nathaniel Putnam to push it south, and thereby save   
the land he had received from his wife's father, Richard   
<pb n="087" id="vI087"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1130">   
<figDesc>Page 087.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Hutchinson, who had purchased from Stileman.   
Allen stood on the defensive against both of them.   
The Nurses had nothing to do but to attend to their   
own business, carrying on their farming operations up   
to the limits of their deed, looking to Allen for redress,   
if, in the end, the dimensions of their estate should be   
curtailed. But, being the occupants, and, until finally   
ousted, the owners of the land, if there was any intrusion to be repelled, or violence to be met, or fighting to be done, they were the ones to do it. They   
were equal to the situation.</p>   
<p>After various trials in the courts of law in all possible shapes, the whole subject was carried up to the   
General Court, where it was decided, in conformity   
with the report of a special commission in May, 1679,   
substantially in favor of Putnam and Allen. Endicott   
petitioned for a new hearing. Another commission   
was appointed; and their report was accepted in May,   
1682. It was more unfavorable to Endicott than the   
previous one. He protested against the judgment of   
the court in earnest but respectful language, and petitioned for still another hearing. They again complied   
with his request, and appointed a day for once more   
examining the case; but, when the day came, Nov. 24,   
1683, he was sick in bed, and the case was settled   
irrevocably against him.</p>   
<p>The map gives the lines of the Bishop farm as   
finally settled by the General Court. It will be noticed,   
that it is laid directly across the Governor's Plain, and   
runs far into the Orchard Farm &ldquo;up to the rocks   
<pb n="088" id="vI088"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1131">   
<figDesc>Page 088.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
near Endicott's dwelling-house,&rdquo; or, as it is otherwise   
stated, &ldquo;within a few rods of Guppy's ditch, near to&rdquo;   
the said house. It may be said to have been a necessity, as the original three hundred acres of the grant   
to Townsend Bishop had to be made up. It could not   
go north; for Houlton and Ingersol stood upon the   
Weston grant, and Hutchinson and Nathaniel Putnam   
stood upon Stileman's grants, to push it back. It   
could not go west or south-west, for there Swinnerton   
stood to fend off upon his grants; and there, too, was   
Nathaniel Putnam, upon his own grant, and lands he   
had purchased of another original grantee. It could   
not be swung round to the south without jamming up   
the lands of Felton and others, or pushing them over   
the grants, made to Robert Cole &mdash; under which Downing had purchased &mdash; and to Thomas Read. All these   
parties were combined to force it south-eastwardly over   
the grounds of Endicott. Nathaniel Putnam was his   
most fatal antagonist. He was a man of remarkable   
energy, of consummate adroitness, and untiring resources in such a transaction; and he so managed to   
press in the bounds of the Bishop farm, at the north, as to gain a valuable strip for himself. With this   
strong man against him, acting in combination with   
the rich and influential James Allen, minister of the   
great metropolitan First Church, and licenser of the   
press, who brought the whole power of his clerical   
and social connections in Boston and throughout the   
colony to bear upon the General Court, Zerubabel   
Endicott had no chance for justice, and no redress for   
<pb n="089" id="vI089"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1132">   
<figDesc>Page 089.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
wrong. In vain he invoked the memory of his father,   
or of Winthrop, the grandfather of his wife. His   
father and both the Winthrops had long before left the   
scene: a new generation had risen, and there was   
none to help him.</p>   
<p>One would have supposed, that the General Court,   
which had granted the Orchard Farm to Governor Endicott, would have felt bound, in self-respect and in   
honor, to have protected it against any overlapping   
grants subsequently made by an inferior authority.   
Under the circumstances of the case, it was its duty   
to have held the Orchard Farm intact, and made it   
up to the satisfaction of Allen and Nurse by a grant   
elsewhere, or an equitable compensation in money.   
It owed so much to the son of Endicott and the   
grand-daughter of Winthrop, the first noble Fathers of   
the colony. Perhaps the court found its justification   
in the phraseology of the deed of conveyance of the   
Bishop farm from Governor Endicott to his son John.   
After reciting or referring to the original town grant   
to Bishop, and the deeds from Bishop to Chickering,   
and from Chickering to himself, the Governor conveys   
to his son John all the houses, &amp;c., and every part and   
parcel of the land &ldquo;to the utmost extent thereof, according as is expressed or included in either of the   
forecited deeds, or town grant.&rdquo; It was maintained,   
and justly, by Allen, that he held all that was conveyed to John Endicott, Jr. But the Court had no   
right to encroach upon the Orchard Farm, which had   
<pb n="090" id="vI090"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1133">   
<figDesc>Page 090.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
been granted to the Governor by them prior to all   
deeds and to the town grant to Bishop.</p>   
<p>Never did that deep and sagacious observation on   
the mysteries of human nature, &ldquo;Men's judgments are   
a parcel of their fortunes,&rdquo; receive a more striking or   
melancholy illustration than in the case of Zerubabel   
Endicott. With his falling fortunes, his judgment and   
discretion fell also; his mind, maddened by a sense   
of wrong, seemed bent upon exposing itself to new   
wrongs. Having been broken down by lawsuits, that   
had wasted his estate, he seemed to have acquired   
a blind passion for them. Having destroyed his peace   
and embarrassed his affairs in attempts to resist the   
adjudications of the Court, he persisted in struggling   
against them. He had tried to push the Bishop grant   
west, over the land of Nathaniel Putnam in that quarter. The highest tribunal had settled it against him.   
But he appeared to be incapable of realizing the fact.   
He sent his hired men to cut timber on that land.   
They worked there some days, felled a large number   
of trees, and hewed them into beams and joists for the   
frame of a house. One morning, returning to their   
work, there was no timber to be found; logs, framework, and all, were gone. They were carefully piled   
up a mile away, by the side of Putnam's dwelling, who had sent two teams, one of four oxen, the   
other of two oxen and a horse, with an adequate force of   
men, and in two loadings had cleaned out the whole.   
Endicott of course sued him, and of course was cast.</p>   
<p>When the General Court had consented to give him   
<pb n="091" id="vI091"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1134">   
<figDesc>Page 091.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
a rehearing of the case of the Bishop farm, they expressly forbade his making any &ldquo;strip&rdquo; of the land in   
the mean while. But with the infatuation which seemed   
to possess him, and not heeding how fatally it would   
prejudice his cause at the impending hearing to violate the order of the Court, he again sent a gang of   
men to cut wood on the land in controversy. The   
following shows the result: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Hugh Jones, aged 46 years, and Alexius Reinolds, aged   
25 years, testify and say, that we, these deponents, being   
desired by Mr. Zerubabel Endicott to cut up some wood, for   
his winter firewood, accordingly went with our teams, which   
had four oxen and a horse; and there we met with several   
other teams of our neighbors, which were upon the same   
account, that is to say, to help carry up Mr. Endicott some   
wood for his winter firewood, and when we had loaded our   
sleds, Thomas Preston and John Tarbell came in a violent   
manner, and hauled the wood out of our sleds; and Francis   
Nurse, being present, demanded whose men we were. Mr.   
Endicott, being present, answered, they were his men.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>These witnesses testify that this &ldquo;battle of the wilderness&rdquo; lasted two days, &mdash; Endicott's men cutting the   
wood and loading the teams, and Nurse's men pitching it off. The altercations and conflicts that took   
place between the parties during those two days may   
easily be imagined. Whether there was a final, decisive pitched battle, we are not informed. Perhaps   
there was. The woods rang with rough echoes, we   
may be well assured. A lawsuit followed; the result   
could not be in doubt. Endicott had no right there;   
<pb n="092" id="vI092"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1135">   
<figDesc>Page 092.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
he was there in direct violation of the order of Court.   
Nurse was in possession, had a right, and was bound,   
to keep the land from being stripped.</p>   
<p>Shortly after this, Endicott broke down, under the   
difficulties that had accumulated around him. On the   
24th of November, 1683, as we have seen, he was &ldquo;sick   
in bed.&rdquo; Two days before, &mdash; that is, on the 22d of   
November, &mdash; he had made his will, which was presented in court on the 27th of March, 1684. He was   
game to the last; for this is an item of the will: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Whereas my late father, by his last will, bequeathed to me   
his farm called Bishop's or Chickering's farm, I do give the   
said farm to my five sons, to be equally divided among them.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The will of his father had been declared invalid on   
that point, and others. The whole thing had been conclusively settled for years; but he never would recognize the fact. It is a singular instance of an obstinacy   
of will completely superseding and suppressing the   
reason and the judgment. He lost the perception of   
the actual and real, in clinging to what he felt to be   
the right.</p>   
<p>Every association and sentiment of his soul had been   
shocked by the wrongs he had suffered. He could not   
walk over his fields, or look from his windows, without   
feeling that a property which his father had given to   
his brother had, in a manner that he knew would have   
been as odious to that father as it was to him, passed   
into the hands of strangers, and been used as a wedge   
on which everybody had conspired to deal blows,   
<pb n="093" id="vI093"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1136">   
<figDesc>Page 093.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
driving it into the centre of his patrimonial acres,   
splitting and rending them through and through. He   
brooded over the thought, until, whenever his mind   
was turned to it, his reason was dethroned, his heart   
broken, and under its weight he fell into his grave.</p>   
<p>An argument addressed by him to the court and   
jury, in one of the innumerable trials of the Bishopfarm case, is among the papers on file. It appears to   
be a verbatim report of the speech as it was delivered at   
the time, and proves him to have been a man of talents.   
It is courteous, gentlemanly, and, I might say, scholarly in its diction and style, skilful in its statements,   
and forcible in its arguments.</p>   
<p>In all the earlier trials, the juries uniformly gave   
verdicts in favor of Endicott; but Allen carried the   
cases up to the General Court, which exercised a final   
and unrestrained jurisdiction in all matters referred   
to it. It usually appointed committees or commissioners to examine such questions, accepted their   
reports, and made them binding. Lands were thus   
disposed of without the agency, and against the decisions, of juries. In his arguments addressed to the   
General Court, Zerubabel Endicott protested against   
this jurisdiction, by which his lands were taken from   
him &ldquo;by a committee, in an arbitrary way, being   
neither bound nor sworn by law or evidence.&rdquo; He   
boldly denounced it.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;To be disseized of my inheritance; to be judged by three   
or four committee-men, who are neither bound to law nor evidence, &mdash; who are, or may be, mutable in their apprehensions,   
<pb n="094" id="vI094"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1137">   
<figDesc>Page 094.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
doing one thing to-day, and soon again undoing what they   
did, &mdash; I conceive, to be judged in such an arbitrary way is   
repugnant to the fundamental law of England contained in   
Magna Charta, chap. 29, which says no freeman shall be disseized of his freehold but by the lawful judgment of his peers,   
&mdash; that is to say, by due process of law; which was also confirmed by the Petition of Right, by Act of Parliament, <hi rend="italics">tertio   
Caroli I.</hi> And also such arbitrary jurisdiction was exploded   
in putting down the Star-Chamber Court; and the excessive   
fines imposed upon all such actings. See `English Liberties,'   
as also the fourth and sixth articles against the Earl of Straffor in Baker's `Chronicle,' folio 518.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>He closes one of his remonstrances thus: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The humble request of your petitioner to the Hon. Gen.   
Court, that, as an Englishman, &mdash; as a freeman of this jurisiction; as descended from him who, in his time, sought the   
welfare of this commonwealth, &mdash; I may have the benefit and   
protection of the wholesome laws established in this jurisdiction: that, in my extreme wrong, I may have liberty to seek   
relief in a way of law, and may not, contrary to Magna   
Charta, be disseized of my freehold by the arbitrary act of   
two or three committee-men; the fundamental law of England   
knowing no such constitution, abhorring such administrations:   
and that the Hon. Court would release your petitioner from   
the injurious effects of the said committee's act, and explode   
so pernicious a precedent.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Zerubabel Endicott was an imprudent and obstinate   
man, but had the traits of a generous, ardent, and   
noble character. He was a physician by profession.   
His second wife &mdash; the widow, as has been stated, of   
Rev. Antipas Newman, of Wenham, and daughter of   
<pb n="095" id="vI095"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1138">   
<figDesc>Page 095.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
John Winthrop, Jr., governor of Connecticut &mdash; survived him. Although he left five sons, the name, at   
one time, was borne by a single descendant only, a lad   
of seven years of age, &mdash; Samuel, a grandson of Zerubabel. On him it hung suspended, but he saved it.   
From that boy, those who bear the name in New England have been derived. We rejoice to believe that   
they will preserve it, and keep its honor bright.</p>   
<p>Winthrop was recognized as the great leader in the   
early history of the Colony. He had a combination   
of qualities that marked him as a wise and good man,   
and gave him precedence. The eminent dignity of his   
character was admired and revered by all. No one   
was more ready to admit this than Endicott. Never   
were men placed towards each other in relations more   
severely testing their magnanimity, and none ever bore   
the test more perfectly. But Endicott was, after all,   
the most complete representative man of that generation. He was thoroughly identified with the people,   
participating in their virtues and in their defects. He   
was a strict religionist, a sturdy Puritan, a firm administrator of the law; at the same time, there are   
indications that he was of a genial spirit. He was   
personally brave, and officially intrepid. His administration of the government required nerve, and he   
had it. Sometimes the ardor of his temperament   
put him for a moment off his guard; but he was   
quick to acknowledge his error. He was true to the   
people, who never faltered in their fidelity to him.   
The author of &ldquo;Wonder-working Providence&rdquo; described   
<pb n="096" id="vI096"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1139">   
<figDesc>Page 096.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
him as &ldquo;a fit instrument to begin the wilderness worke, of courage bold undaunted, yet sociable and of a cheerful spirit.&rdquo; I have presented some   
instances of his kind and pleasant relations with his   
workmen and neighbors. His name will ever be held   
in honored remembrance in this vicinity, where his   
useful enterprise was appreciated; and his descendants   
in our day, and to the present time, have contributed   
to the prosperity and the adornment of the community.</p>   
<p>It is not unlikely, that hostile feelings towards the   
Nurses, which contributed afterwards to serious results, may have been engendered in this long-continued   
land quarrel. There is evidence that no such feeling   
existed on the part of the Endicotts: but there were   
many others interested; for, by testimony at the trials   
and in outside discussions, the whole community had   
become more or less implicated in the strife. The   
Nurses, as holding the ground and having to bear   
the brunt of defending it in all cases of intrusion, had   
a difficult position, and may have made some enemies.   
At any rate, this controversy was one of the means of   
stirring up animosities in the neighborhood; and an   
account of it has been deemed necessary, as contributing to indicate the elements of the awful convulsions which soon afterwards desolated Salem Village.</p>   
<p>When we reach the story, for which this account of   
the farms of the village and the population that grew   
up on them is a preparative, we shall come back to the   
Townsend-Bishop grant, and to the house, still standing, that he built and dwelt in, upon it. It may be   
<pb n="097" id="vI097"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1140">   
<figDesc>Page 097.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
well to pause, and view its interesting history prior to   
1692. While occupied by its original owner, the   
&ldquo;mansion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;cottage,&rdquo; was the scene of social intercourse among the choicest spirits of the earliest   
age of New England. Here Bishop, and, after him,   
Chickering, entertained their friends. Here the fine   
family of Richard Ingersoll was brought up. Here   
Governor Endicott projected plans for opening the   
country; and the road that passes its entrance-gate was   
laid out by him. To this same house, young John   
Endicott brought his youthful Boston bride. Here   
she came again, fifteen years afterwards, as the bride of   
the learned and distinguished James Allen, to show   
him the farm which, received as a &ldquo;marriage gift&rdquo;   
from her former husband, she had brought as a &ldquo;marriage gift&rdquo; to him. Here the same Allen, in less than   
six years afterwards, brought still another bride.   
In all these various, and some of them rather rapid,   
changes, it was, no doubt, often the resort of distinguished guests, and the place of meeting of many   
pleasant companies. During the protracted years of   
litigation for its possession, frequent consultations   
were held within it; and now, for twelve years, it had   
been the home of a happy, harmonious, and prosperous family, exemplifying the industry, energy, and enterprise of a New England household. A new chapter   
was destined, as we shall see, to be opened in its   
singular and diversified history. But we must return   
to the enumeration of the original landholders of the   
village.</p>

<p>George Corwin came to Salem in 1638. He had   
large tracts of land in various places. He lived, a   
part of his time, on his farm in the village; is found to   
have taken an active part in the proceedings of the   
people, particularly in military affairs; and was captain   
of a company of cavalry. His great mercantile transactions probably led him to have his residence mostly   
in the town, first on a lot on Washington Street, near   
the corner of Norman Street, where his grandson the   
sheriff lived in 1692. In 1660, he bought of Ann,   
the relict of Nicholas Woodbury, a lot on Essex Street,   
next east of the Browne Block, with a front of about   
one hundred and fifty feet. Here he built a fine mansion, in which he lived the remainder of his days. He   
died Jan. 6, 1685, leaving an estate inventoried at   
&pound;5,964. 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 7<hi rend="italics">d.,</hi> &mdash; a large fortune for those times. His   
portrait is preserved by his descendants, one of whom,   
the late George A. Ward, describes his dress as represented in the picture: &ldquo;A wrought flowing neckcloth,   
a sash covered with lace, a coat with short cuffs and   
reaching half-way between the wrist and elbow; the   
skirts in plaits below; an octagon ring and cane.&rdquo;   
The last two articles are still preserved. His inventory   
mentions &ldquo;a silver-laced cloth coat, a velvet ditto, a   
satin waistcoat embroidered with gold, a trooping   
scarf and silver hat-band, golden-topped and embroidered, and a silver-headed cane.&rdquo; His farms in the   
vicinity contained fifteen hundred acres. His connections were distinguished, and his descendants have   
included many eminent persons. The name, by male

descent, disappeared for a time in this part of the   
country; but in the last generation it was restored in   
the female descent by an act of the Legislature, and   
is honorably borne by one of our most respectable families, who inherit his blood, and cherish the memorials   
which time has spared of their first American ancestor.</p>   
<p>William Hathorne appears on the church records as   
early as 1636. He died in June, 1681, seventy-four   
years of age. No one in our annals fills a larger   
space. As soldier commanding important and difficult expeditions, as counsel in cases before the courts,   
as judge on the bench, and in innumerable other   
positions requiring talent and intelligence, he was   
constantly called to serve the public. He was distinguished as a public speaker, and is the only person, I   
believe, of that period, whose reputation as an orator   
has come down to us. He was an Assistant, that is,   
in the upper branch of the Legislature, seventeen   
years. He was a deputy twenty years. When the   
deputies, who before sat with the assistants, were   
separated into a distinct body, and the House of Representatives thus came into existence, in 1644, Hathorne was their first Speaker. He occupied the chair,   
with intermediate services on the floor from time to   
time, until raised to the other House. He was an inhabitant of Salem Village, having his farm there, and   
a dwelling-house, in which he resided when his legislative, military, and other official duties permitted.   
His son John, who succeeded him in all his public   
honors, also lived on his own farm in the village   
<pb n="100" id="vI100"/>

a great part of the time. The name is indelibly   
stamped on the hills and meadows of the region, as   
it was in the civil history of that age, and has been in   
the elegant literature of the present.</p>   
<p>William Trask was one of the what are called the   
&ldquo;First Planters.&rdquo; He came over before Endicott,   
had his residence on Salem Farms, was a most energetic, enterprising, and useful citizen, and filled a   
great variety of public stations. He brought large   
tracts of land under culture, planted orchards, and   
established mills at the head of tide-water on the   
North River. He was the military leader of the first   
age of the plantations in this neighborhood, was captain of the train-band from the beginning, and, by his   
gallantry and energy in action, commanded the applause of his contemporaries. For his services in the   
Pequot Expedition, the General Court gave him and   
his associates large grants of land. His obsequies   
were celebrated, on the 16th of May, 1666, with great   
military parade; and the people of the town and the   
whole surrounding country followed his honored remains to the grave.</p>   
<p>Richard Davenport came to Salem in 1631. His   
first residence was in the town; but soon he was led   
to the Farms. In 1636, he received a grant of eighty   
acres; in 1638, of two hundred and twenty acres;   
and, in 1642, eighty acres more, to be divided between   
him and Captain Lothrop. Besides these, he received   
several smaller grants of meadow and salt marsh.   
Such grants were made only with the view of having   
<pb n="101" id="vI101"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1144">   
<figDesc>Page 101.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
them duly improved; and it cannot be doubted that   
he was zealously engaged in agricultural operations.   
His town residence was on a lot reaching from Essex   
Street to the North River. Its front extended from   
the grounds now the site of the North Church to   
North Street. His house stood at some distance back   
from Essex Street. This estate was sold by his administrators, in 1674, to Jonathan Corwin, whose   
family occupied it until a very recent period. He left   
the town in 1643, and subsequently lived in what was   
afterwards Salem Village, until the public service   
called him away. He sold some of his estates, but   
retained others, on the Farms and in the town, to the   
time of his death. He continued the superintendence   
of his country estate, which seems to have been his   
family home, to the last. His military career gave   
him early distinction, and closed only with his life.   
In 1634, the General Court chose him &ldquo;Ensign to   
Capt. Trask.&rdquo; He was concerned with Endicott in   
cutting out the cross from the king's colors. The following is from the record of a meeting of the court,   
Nov. 7, 1634: &ldquo;It is ordered that Ensign Davenport shall be sent for by warrant, with command to   
bring his colors with him to the next court, as also   
any other that hath defaced the said colors.&rdquo; Davenport did not seem anxious to cover up his agency in   
this matter; for, when he offered his next child to   
baptism, he signified to the assembly that he was determined to commemorate and perpetuate the memory   
of the transaction, by having her christened &ldquo;True   
<pb n="102" id="vI102"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1145">   
<figDesc>Page 102.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Cross.&rdquo; It was necessary to make a show of punishing Endicott and Davenport on this occasion, to prevent trouble from the home government. Soon after,   
we find the General Court heaping honors upon Davenport, and finally, in 1639, making him a grant of   
one hundred and fifty acres of land, specially noticing   
his services in the Pequot War, which appear to have   
elicited general applause. In some desperate encounters with the savages, seventeen arrows were shot   
&ldquo;into his coat of mail,&rdquo; and he was wounded in unprotected parts of his person. He was twice deputy to   
the General Court. In 1644, the General Court organized an elaborate system of external defence, the whole   
based upon Castle Island, now Fort Independence, in   
Boston Harbor. From that point, hostile invasion by a   
naval force was to be repelled. Every vessel, on entering, was to report to the castle, be examined and subject   
to the orders of the commandant. It became the military headquarters of the colony, the protection and   
oversight of whose commerce were intrusted to the   
officer in command. This was the highest military   
station and trust in the gift of the Government. It was   
assigned to Richard Davenport; and he held it for   
twenty-one years, to the moment of his death. The   
country reposed in confidence upon his watchful fidelity. He put and kept the castle in an efficient condition.   
In 1659, as evidence of their satisfaction and approval   
of his official conduct, the General Court made him a   
grant of five hundred acres of land laid out in Lancaster. On the 15th of July, 1665, he was killed by   
<pb n="103" id="vI103"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1146">   
<figDesc>Page 103.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
lightning, at his post. The records of the General   
Court speak of &ldquo;the solemn stroke of thunder that   
took away Captain Davenport.&rdquo; The whole country   
mourned the loss of the veteran soldier; and the Court   
granted his family an additional tract of one hundred   
acres of land on the Merrimac River. He was in   
his sixtieth year at the time of his death. Of the   
company required to be raised in Salem for the Block Expedition, in 1636, the three commissioned   
officers were furnished from the Farms, &mdash; Trask, Davenport, and Read. They were soldiers by nature and   
instinct, and to the end. The volleys of devoted,   
faithful, and mourning comrades were fired over their   
graves, with no great interval of time. United in   
early service, separated by the course of their lives,   
they were united again in death.</p>   
<p>Thomas Lothrop originally lived in the town, between Collins Cove and the North River. He became   
a member of the First Church in Salem, and was admitted a freeman in 1634. He soon removed to the   
Farms; and his name appears among the rate-payers   
at the formation of the village parish. For many   
years he was deputy from Salem to the General   
Court; and after Beverly was set off, as his residence   
at the time was on that side of the line, he was always   
in the General Court, as deputy from the new town,   
when his other public employments permitted. No man   
was ever more identified with the history of the Salem   
Farms. He contributed to form the structure of its   
society, and the character of its population, by all that   
<pb n="104" id="vI104"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1147">   
<figDesc>Page 104.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
a wise and good man could do. During his whole life   
in America, he was more or less engaged in the military service, in arduous, difficult, and dangerous positions and operations; acting sometimes against   
Indians, and sometimes against the French, or, as was   
usually the case, against them both combined. He   
was occasionally sent to distant posts; commanding   
expeditions to the eastward as far as Acadia. He   
was at one time in charge of a force at Port Royal,   
now Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Increase Mather calls   
him a &ldquo;godly and courageous commander.&rdquo; When   
the last decisive struggle with King Philip was approaching, and aid was needed from the eastern part   
of the colony to rescue the settlements on the Connecticut River from utter destruction, the &ldquo;Flower of   
Essex&rdquo; was summoned to the field. It was a choice   
body of efficient men, &ldquo;all culled out of the towns   
belonging to this county,&rdquo; numbering about one hundred men. Lothrop, of course, was their captain. In   
August, 1675, they were on the ground at Hadley, the   
place of rendezvous. On the 26th of that month,   
Captain Lothrop, with his company, and Captain   
Beers, of Watertown, with his, after a vigorous pursuit, attacked the Indians in a swamp, about ten miles   
from Hatfield, at the foot of Sugar-Loaf Hill. Ten   
were killed on the side of the English, and twenty-six   
on the side of the Indians, who were driven from the   
swamp, and scattered in their flight; to fall, as was   
their custom, upon detached settlements; and continuing to waste and destroy, by fire and sword, with   
<pb n="105" id="vI105"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1148">   
<figDesc>Page 105.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
hatchet, scalping-knife, torch, and gun. On the 18th   
of September, Lothrop, with his company, started from   
Deerfield, to convoy a train of eighteen wagons, loaded   
with grain, and furniture of the inhabitants seeking refuge from danger, with teamsters and others.   
Moseley, with his men, remained behind, to scout the   
woods, and give notice of the approach of Indians;   
but the stealthy savages succeeded in effecting a complete surprise, and fell upon Lothrop as his wagons   
were crossing a stream. They poured in a destructive   
fire from the woods, in all directions. They were   
seven to one. A perfect carnage ensued. Lothrop   
fell early in the unequal fight, and only seven or eight   
of his whole party were left to tell the story of the   
fatal scene. The locality of this disastrous and sanguinary tragedy has ever since been known as &ldquo;Bloody   
Brook.&rdquo; In the list of those who perished by bullet,   
tomahawk, or arrow, on that fearful morning, we read   
the names of many village neighbors of the brave and   
lamented commander, &mdash; Thomas Bayley, Edward   
Trask, Josiah Dodge, Peter Woodbury, Joseph Balch,   
Thomas Buckley, Joseph King, Robert Wilson, and   
James Tufts. One of Lothrop's sergeants, who was   
among the slain, Thomas Smith, then of Newbury,   
originated in the village. His family had grants of   
land, including the hill called by their name.</p>   
<p>Captain Lothrop was as remarkable for the benevolence of his spirit and the tenderness of his nature as   
for his wisdom in council, energy in command, or gallantry in battle. Indeed, his character in private life   
<pb n="106" id="vI106"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1149">   
<figDesc>Page 106.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was so beautiful and lovable, that I cannot refrain   
from leading you into the recesses of his domestic   
circle. It presents a picture of rare attractiveness.   
He had no children. His wife was a kind and amiable   
person. They longed for objects upon which to gratify   
the yearnings of their affectionate hearts. He had a   
large estate. His character became known to the   
neighbors and the country people around. If there   
was an occurrence calling for commiseration anywhere in the vicinity, it was managed to bring it to   
his notice. Orphan children were received into his   
household, and brought up with parental care and tenderness. Many were, in this way, the objects of his   
charity and affections. Persons especially, who were   
in any degree connected with his wife's family, naturally conceived the desire to have him adopt their   
children. This was the case particularly with those   
who were in straitened circumstances. Others, knowing his disposition, would bring tales of distress and   
destitution to his ears. Some, perhaps, turned out   
to be unworthy of his goodness. In one instance,   
at least, where he had taken a child into his family   
in its infancy, touched by appeals made to his compassion by the parents, brought it up carefully,   
watched over its education, and become attached to it,   
when it had reached an age to be serviceable, the   
parents claimed and insisted on their right to it, and   
took it away, much against his will. But the good   
man's benevolence was not impaired, nor the stream   
of his affectionate charities checked, by the misconduct   
<pb n="107" id="vI107"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1150">   
<figDesc>Page 107.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
or ingratitude of his wards or of their friends. His   
plan was to do all the good in his power to the children thus brought into his family, to prepare them for   
usefulness, and start them favorably in life. In the   
case of boys, he would get them apprenticed to worthy   
people in useful callings. At the time of his death,   
there were two grown-up members of his family, who   
appear to have been foisted upon his care in their earliest childhood. But there was no blame to be attached to them in the premises; and they were   
regarded by him with much affection. There were no   
relations of his own in this country in need of charitable aid or without adequate parental protection; and   
it was not strange that several of his wife's connections should have availed themselves of the benefit of   
his generous disposition. She herself gives a very   
interesting account of an instance of this sort, in a   
deposition found wrapped up among some old papers   
in the county court-house. The object of the statement was to explain how a connection of hers became   
domesticated in the family.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;When the child's mother was dead, my husband being   
with me at my cousin's burial, and seeing our friends in so   
sad a condition, the poor babe having lost its mother, and the   
woman that nursed it being fallen sick, I then did say to   
some of my friends, that, if my husband would give me leave,   
I could be very willing to take my cousin's little one for a   
while, till he could better dispose of it; whereupon the child's   
father did move it to my husband. My dear husband, considering my weakness, and the incumbrance I had in the family.   
<pb n="108" id="vI108"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1151">   
<figDesc>Page 108.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was pleased to return this answer, &mdash; that he did not see how   
it was possible for his wife to undergo such a burden. The   
next day there came a friend to our house, a woman which   
gave suck, and she understanding how the poor babe was   
left, being intreated, was willing to take it to nurse, and forthwith it was brought to her: but it had not been with her three   
weeks before it pleased the Lord to visit that nurse with sickness also; and the nurse's mother came to me desiring I   
would take the child from her daughter, and then my dear   
husband, observing the providence of God, was freely willing   
to receive her into his house.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>At the time when this addition was made to his   
family, there was certainly already in it another of   
his wife's connections, who had been brought there   
when an infant in a manner perhaps equally singular,   
and who had grown up to maturity. The particular   
&ldquo;incumbrance,&rdquo; however, spoken of by her, related to   
another matter. She was an only daughter. Her   
father had died many years before, at quite an advanced age. Her mother, who was sickly and infirm as   
well as aged, was taken immediately into her family,   
and remained under her roof until her death. In her   
weak and helpless condition, much care and exertion   
were thrown upon her daughter. The only objection   
the captain seemed to have to increasing the burden   
of the household, by receiving into it this additional   
child with its nurse, resulted from conjugal tenderness   
and considerateness. It must be confessed that there   
are some indications of well-arranged management in   
the foregoing account. The friend who happened to   
<pb n="109" id="vI109"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1152">   
<figDesc>Page 109.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
call at the house the &ldquo;next day,&rdquo; and who was able   
to supply what the &ldquo;poor babe&rdquo; needed, certainly   
came very opportunely; and there was altogether a   
remarkable concurrence and sequence of circumstances. But all that he saw was a case of suffering,   
helpless innocence, and an opportunity for benevolence   
and charity; and in these, with a true theology, he   
read &ldquo;a providence of God.&rdquo; That child continued,   
to the hour when he took his last farewell of his   
family, beneath his roof, and was an object of affectionate care, and in her amiable qualities a source of   
happiness to him and his good wife. It is stated that   
the children, thus from time to time domesticated in   
the family, called him father, and that he addressed   
them as his children. While they were infants, he   
was &ldquo;a tender nursing father&rdquo; to them. When fondling them in his arms, in the presence of his wife, he   
would solemnly take notice of the providence of God   
that had &ldquo;disposed of them from one place to another&rdquo; until they had been brought to him; and   
&ldquo;would present them in his desires to God, and   
implore a blessing upon them.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The picture presented in the foregoing details is   
worth rescuing from oblivion. Such instances of actual life, exhibited in the most private spheres, constitute a branch of history more valuable, in some   
respects, than the public acts of official dignitaries.   
History has been too exclusively confined, in its materials, to the movements of states and of armies. It   
ought to paint the portraits of individual men and   
<pb n="110" id="vI110"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1153">   
<figDesc>Page 110.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
women in their common lives; it ought to lead us   
into the interior of society, and introduce us to the   
family circles and home experiences of the past. It   
cannot but do us good to know Thomas Lothrop, not   
only as an early counsellor among the legislators of   
the colony, and as having immortalized by his blood   
a memorable field of battle and slaughter, but as the   
centre of a happy and virtuous household on a New   
England farm. He made that home happy by his   
benignant virtue. Although denied the blessing of   
children of his own, his fireside was enlivened with the   
prattle and gayeties of the young. Joy and hope   
and growth were within his walls. He was not a   
parent; but his heart was kept warm with parental   
affections. He had a home where dear ones waited   
for him, and rushed out to meet and cling round him   
with loving arms, and welcome him with merry voices,   
when he returned from the sessions of the General   
Court, or from campaigns against the French and   
Indians.</p>   
<p>Besides these offices of beneficence in the domestic   
sphere, we find traces, in the local records, of constant   
usefulness and kindness among his rural neighbors.   
He was called, on all occasions, to advise and assist.   
As a judicious friend, he was relied upon and sought   
at the bedside of the sick and dying, and in families   
bereaved of their head. His name appears as a witness to wills, appraiser of estates, trustee and guardian of the young. He was the friend of all. I know   
not where to find a more perfect union of the hero and   
<pb n="111" id="vI111"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1154">   
<figDesc>Page 111.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the Christian; of all that is manly and chivalrous with   
all that is tender, benevolent, and devout.</p>   
<p>Somewhere about the year 1650, after he had been   
married a considerable time, he revisited his native   
country. A sister, Ellen, had, in the mean while,   
grown up from early childhood; and he found her all   
that a fond brother could have hoped for. With much   
persuasion, he besought his mother to allow her to   
return with him to America. He stated that he had   
no children; that he would be a father to her, and   
watch over and care for her as for his own child. At   
length the mother yielded, and committed her daughter to his custody, not without great reluctance, trusting to his fraternal affection and plighted promise.   
He brought her over with him to his American home.   
She was worthy of his love, and he was true to his   
sacred and precious trust.</p>   
<p>Ellen Lothrop became the wife of Ezekiel Cheever,   
the great schoolmaster; and I should consider myself   
false to all good learning, if I allowed the name of this   
famous old man to slip by, without pausing to pay   
homage to it. His record, as a teacher of a Latin   
Grammar School, is unrivalled. Twelve years at New   
Haven, eleven at Ipswich, nine at Charlestown, and   
more than thirty-eight at Boston, &mdash; more than seventy   
in all, &mdash; may it not be safely said that he was one of   
the very greatest benefactors of America? With   
Elijah Corlett, who taught a similar school at Cambridge for more than forty years, he bridged over the   
wide chasm between the education brought with them   
<pb n="112" id="vI112"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1155">   
<figDesc>Page 112.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
by the fathers from the old country, and the education   
that was reared in the new. They fed and kept alive   
the lamp of learning through the dark age of our   
history. All the scholars raised here were trained by   
them. One of Cotton Mather's most characteristic   
productions is the tribute to his venerated master. It   
flows from a heart warm with gratitude. &ldquo;Although   
he had usefully spent his life among children, yet he   
was not become twice a child,&rdquo; but held his faculties   
to the last. &ldquo;In this great work of bringing our sons   
to be men, he was my master seven and thirty years   
ago, was master to my betters no less than seventy   
years ago; so long ago, that I must even mention my   
father's tutor for one of them. He was a Christian of   
the old fashion, &mdash; an old New England Christian; and   
I may tell you, that was as venerable a sight, as the   
world, since the days of primitive Christianity, has   
ever looked upon. He lived, as a master, the term   
which has been, for above three thousand years, assigned for the life of a man.&rdquo; Mather celebrated his   
praises in a poetical effusion: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;He lived, and to vast age no illness knew,</l>   
<l>Till Time's scythe, waiting for him, rusty grew.</l>   
<l>He lived and wrought; his labors were immense,</l>   
<l>But ne'er declined to preterperfect tense.</l>   
<l>........</l>   
<l>'Tis Corlett's pains, and Cheever's, we must own,</l>   
<l>That thou, New England, art not Scythia grown.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>To our early schoolmasters, as Mather says, and   
the later too, I may add, it is owing, that the whole   
country did not become another Scythia.</p>

<note id="v1n1"><p>* Not only the storms of two hundred and thirty years, but the   
bolts of heaven, have beat in vain upon this mansion. The view given   
of it in the frontispiece is from a sketch taken in winter. The   
leafless branches of a tall elm at its western end are represented.   
At noon on Saturday, July 28, 1866, during a violent thunder-storm,   
the electric fluid seems to have passed down the tree, rending and   
tearing some of its branches, and leaving its traces on the trunk. It   
flashed into the house. It tore the roof, knocking away one corner,   
displacing in patches the mortar that coated the old chimney top and   
sides, hacking the edges of the brick-work, splitting off the side of   
an extension to the building at the western end, entering a chamber   
at that point, where two children were sitting at a window, and throwing upon the floor, within two or three feet of them, a considerable   
portion of the plastered ceiling. It then scattered all through the   
apartments. What looked like perforations, as if made by shot or   
pistol-balls, were found in many places; but there were no corresponding marks on the opposite sides of the walls or partitions. Portions   
of the paper-hangings were stripped off, and small slivers ripped up   
from the floors. It struck the frames of looking-glasses, cracking off   
small pieces of the wood, but only in one instance breaking the mirror.   
It cut a velvet band by which one was hung; and it was found on the   
floor, the mirror downward and unbroken, as if it had been carefully   
laid there. In the attic, fragments of the old gnarled and knotted   
rafters, of different lengths, &mdash; from four or five feet to mere chips, &mdash;   
were scattered in quantities upon the floor, and grooves made lengthwise along posts and implements of household use. Large cracks   
were left in the wooden casings of some of the doors and windows.   
A family of eight persons were seated around the dinner-table. All   
were more or less affected. They were deprived for the time of the   
use of their feet and ancles; were stunned, paralyzed, and rendered   
insensible for a few moments by the shock; and felt the effects, some   
of them, for a day or two in their lower limbs. In front of each person at the table was a tall goblet, which had just been filled with water.   
As soon as they were able to notice, they found the water dripping on   
all sides to the floor, the whole table-cloth wet, seven of the goblets   
entirely empty, the eighth half emptied, and not one of them thrown   
over, or in the slightest manner displaced. The whole house was filled   
with what seemed, to the sight and smell, to be smoke; but no combustion, scorch, discoloration, or the least indication of heat, could be   
found on any of the objects struck. The building, in its thirteen   
rooms, from the garret to the ground-floor, had been flooded with   
lightning; but, with all its inmates, escaped without considerable or   
permanent injury.</p></note>

<p>Ezekiel Cheever was in this country as early as   
1637. He was then in New Haven, sharing in the   
work of the first settlement of that colony, teaching   
school as his ordinary employment, but sometimes   
preaching, and in other ways helping to lay the foundations of church and commonwealth. While there, he   
had a family of several children. The first-born,   
Samuel, became the minister of Marblehead. In   
1650, he was keeping a school at Ipswich. About   
this time, he lost his wife. On the 18th of November,   
1652, he married Ellen, the sister whom Captain Lothrop had brought with him from England. They had   
several children; one of them, Thomas, was ordained   
first at Malden, and afterwards at Chelsea. The old   
schoolmaster died on the 21st of August, 1708, aged   
ninety-three years and seven months. His son   
Thomas reached the same age. Samuel, the minister   
at Marblehead, was eighty-five years old at his death.   
The name of Ezekiel, jr., appears on the rate-list of   
the village parish as late as 1731, so that he must   
have reached the age of at least seventy-seven years.</p>   
<p>The antiquarians have been sorely perplexed in determining the relationship of the Cheevers and Reas,   
as they appear to be connected together as heirs of the   
Lothrop property, in an order of the General Court of   
the 11th of June, 1681.</p>   
<p>The facts are these: Captain Lothrop married Bethia, daughter of Daniel Rea. He died without   
issue, and had made no will. As he was killed in   
battle, his widow undertook to set up a nuncupative   
<pb n="114" id="vI114"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1157">   
<figDesc>Page 114.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
will. A snow-storm, on the day appointed to act upon   
the matter, so blocked up the roads, that neither   
Ezekiel Cheever nor his son Thomas, who had charge   
of his mother's rights, could get to Salem; and the   
court granted administration to the widow. The   
Cheevers demanded a rehearing: it was granted; and   
quite an interesting and pertinacious law-suit arose,   
which was finally carried up to the General Court,   
who decided it in 1681. The widow does not appear   
to have been actuated by merely selfish motives, but   
sought to divert a portion of the landed estate from   
the only legal heir, Ellen, the wife of Ezekiel Cheever,   
to other parties, in favor of whom her feelings were   
much enlisted. There is no indication of any unfriendliness between her and her &ldquo;sister Cheever.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Lothrop's wife had become much attached to one of   
her connections, who had been brought into the family.   
Her husband, having been fond of children, had often   
expressed great affection for those of her brother,   
Joshua Rea. He had also sometimes, in expressing   
his interest in the Beverly Church, evinced a disposition to leave to it &ldquo;his ten acre lot and his house   
upon the same,&rdquo; as a parsonage. Perhaps, if he had   
not been suddenly called away, he might have done   
something, particularly for the latter object. It appeared in evidence, from her statements and from   
others, that he had been importuned to make a will,   
and that it was much on his mind, particularly when   
recovering from a long and dangerous sickness the   
winter before his death; but he never could be   
<pb n="115" id="vI115"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1158">   
<figDesc>Page 115.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
brought to do it. There was no evidence that he had   
ever absolutely determined on any thing positively or   
specifically. His widow, who seems to have been a   
perfectly honest and truthful woman, testified to a conversation that passed between them on the subject, as   
they were riding &ldquo;together towards Wenham, the last   
spring, in the week before the Court of election.&rdquo; In   
passing by particular pieces of property owned by him,   
he indulged in some speculations as to what disposal   
he should make of this or that pasture or plain or   
woodland. But she did not represent that his expressions were absolute and determinate, but rather indicative of the then inclination of his mind. In   
another part of her statement, she said, &ldquo;I did desire   
him to make his will, which, when he was sick, I did   
more than once or twice; and his answer to me was,   
that he did look upon it as that which was very   
requisite and fit should be done. But, dear wife,   
thou hast no cause to be troubled; if I should die and   
not make a will, it would be never the worse for thee;   
thyself would have the more.&rdquo; It is not difficult to   
understand the case as it probably stood in the mind   
of Captain Lothrop. Whenever the subject of making   
a will, and doing kind things for the Beverly parish,   
and the individuals in whose behalf his wife was so   
anxious, was brought up, he felt the force, as he expressed it, &ldquo;of the duty which God required of a   
master of a family to set his house in order;&rdquo; and he   
was no doubt strongly moved, and sometimes almost   
resolved, to gratify her wishes: but he remembered the   
<pb n="116" id="vI116"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1159">   
<figDesc>Page 116.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
solemn promise he had made to his mother, as he   
parted from her for ever, and received his sister from   
her hands, and every sentiment of honor, and of   
filial and fraternal love, restrained him; and his mind   
settled into a conviction that it was his duty to allow   
his sister the benefit of the final inheritance of his   
property. As the particular persons to whom his wife   
wished him to make bequests were her relatives, and   
the law would give her an ample allowance in the use,   
for life, of his large landed property, she would be   
able to provide for them after his death, as he had   
been in the habit of doing.</p>   
<p>The General Court took a just view of the case, and   
decided that she should have the whole movable estate   
for her own &ldquo;use and dispose,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;use and   
benefit&rdquo; for life of the houses and lands, &ldquo;making no   
strip nor waste;&rdquo; after her death, the same to go to   
Ellen, the wife of Ezekiel Cheever. The widow was   
to pay all debts due from the estate, and also twenty   
pounds to the children of her brother, Joshua Rea.   
The Court seemed to think, that, if any expectations   
had been excited in that quarter, she was fully as responsible for it as her late husband; and, as the   
Cheevers were to get nothing, while she lived, out of   
the estate, the Court required her to pay the sum just   
named to her nephews and nieces. They ordered   
Ezekiel Cheever to pay five pounds as costs for their   
hearing the case, which he did on the spot.</p>   
<p>It may be mentioned, by the way, that the widow   
of Captain Lothrop was married again within eight   
<pb n="117" id="vI117"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1160">   
<figDesc>Page 117.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
months of his death; but that was quite usual in   
those days. She and her new husband concluded that   
it would be troublesome to take care of Captain   
Lothrop's several farms. They preferred to live in   
the town. She was probably over sixty years of age.   
The conclusion of the whole matter was, that, in consideration of sixty pounds paid down, they surrendered all claim whatever to the &ldquo;houseing and lands&rdquo;   
left by Captain Lothrop, to Cheever and his wife. They   
conveyed them &ldquo;free and clear of and from all debts   
owing from the estate of said Lothrop, and gifts or bequests pretended to be made by him, or by any ways   
or means to be had, claimed, or challenged therefrom   
by any person or persons whomsoever.&rdquo; The relict of   
Captain Lothrop died in 1688.</p>   
<p>Ezekiel Cheever and his wife, having thus become   
possessed of all her brother's real estate, conveyed the   
lands belonging to it in Salem Village to their son,   
Ezekiel Cheever, Jr. He had, for some years, been living in the town of Salem, carrying on the business of   
a tailor. He was a member of the First Church, and   
appears to have been a respectable person. His   
dwelling-house stood on the lot in Washington Street   
occupied by the late Robert Brookhouse. He sold it   
to the Rev. Nicholas Noyes, on the 14th of April,   
1684, removed to the village, took possession of the   
Lothrop farm, and was there in time to bear a share in   
the witchcraft delusion.</p>   
<p>In 1636, a grant of land was made to Thomas   
Gardner of one hundred acres. He came to this   
<pb n="118" id="vI118"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1161">   
<figDesc>Page 118.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
country as early as 1624, and resided at Cape Ann.   
Subsequently he removed to Salem, and, with his wife,   
was admitted to the church. He was deputy to the   
General Court in 1637. His grant was in the western   
part of the township, and embraced land included   
within the limits of Salem Village. The name still   
remains on the same territory. His sons became proprietors of several additional tracts in the neighborhood. One of them, Joseph, is connected, in the most   
conspicuous and interesting manner, with our military   
history.</p>   
<p>The destruction of Captain Lothrop and his company, on the 18th of September, filled the country   
with grief and consternation; and, as the year 1675   
drew towards a close, the conviction became general,   
that the crisis of the fate of the colonies was near at   
hand. The Indians were carrying all before them.   
Philip was spreading conflagration, devastation, and   
slaughter around the borders, and striking sudden   
and deadly blows into the heart of the country. It   
was evident that he was consolidating the Indian   
power into irresistible strength. Among papers on   
file in the State House is a letter addressed to the governor and council, dated at Mendon, Oct. 1, 1675,   
from Lieutenant Phinehas Upham, of Malden. In   
command of a company, acting under Captain Gorham of Barnstable, who had also a company of his   
own, he had been on a scout for Indians beyond Mendon, which was a frontier town. Their route had   
been over a sweep of territory then an almost unbroken   
<pb n="119" id="vI119"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1162">   
<figDesc>Page 119.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
wilderness, embracing the present sites of Grafton, Worcester, Oxford, and Dudley. The result of   
the exploration is thus given: &ldquo;Now, seeing that in   
all our marches we find no Indians, we verily think   
that they are drawn together into great bodies far   
remote from these parts.&rdquo; From other scouting parties, it became evident that this opinion was correct,   
and that the Indians were collecting stores and assembling their warriors somewhere, to fall upon the   
colonies at the first opening of spring. Further information made it certain, that their place of gathering   
was in the Narragansett country, in the south-westerly   
part of the colony of Rhode Island. There was no   
alternative but, as a last effort, to strike the enemy at   
that point, with the utmost available force. A thousand men were raised, 527 by Massachusetts, 315 by   
Connecticut, and 158 by Plymouth. Massachusetts   
organized a company of cavalry and six companies of   
foot soldiers, Connecticut five and Plymouth two companies of foot. All were placed under the command   
of Governor Winslow, of Plymouth. The winter had   
set in earlier than usual; much snow had fallen, and   
the weather was extremely cold. The seven companies of Massachusetts, under the command of Major   
Samuel Appleton of Ipswich, started on their march,   
Dec. 10. On the evening of the 12th, having   
effected a junction with the Plymouth companies, they   
reached the rendezvous, on the north side of Wickford   
Hill, in North Kingston, R.I. On the 13th, Winslow   
commenced his move upon the enemy. On the 18th,   
<pb n="120" id="vI120"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1163">   
<figDesc>Page 120.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the Connecticut troops joined him. His army was   
complete; the enemy was known to be near, and all   
haste made to reach him. The snow was deep.   
The Narragansetts were intrenched on a somewhat   
elevated piece of ground of five or six acres in area,   
surrounded by a swamp, within the limits of the   
present town of South Kingston. The Indian camp   
was strongly fortified by a double row of palisades,   
about a rod apart, and also by a thick hedge. There   
was but a single entrance known to our troops, which   
could only be reached, one at a time, over a slanting log or felled tree, slippery from frost and falling   
snow, about six feet above a ditch. There were   
other passages, known only to the Indians, by which   
they could steal out, a few at a time, and get a shot   
at our people in the flank and rear. Many of our   
men were cut off in this way. The allied forces had   
expected to pass the night, previous to reaching the   
hostile camp, at a garrison about fifteen miles distant   
from that point; but the Indians had destroyed the   
buildings, and slaughtered the occupants, seventeen   
in number, two days before. Here the troops passed   
the night, unsheltered from the bitter weather. The   
next day, Dec. 19, was Sunday; but their provisions   
were exhausted, and the supply they had expected to   
find had been destroyed with the garrison-house.   
There could be no delay. They recommenced their   
march, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, through   
the deep snow, which continued falling all day, and   
reached the borders of what was described, by a   
<pb n="121" id="vI121"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1164">   
<figDesc>Page 121.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
writer well acquainted with it, as &ldquo;a hideous swamp.&rdquo;   
Fortunately, the early and long-continued extreme   
cold weather of that winter had rendered it more passable than it otherwise would have been. But the   
ground was rough, and very difficult to traverse. They   
were chilled and worn by their long march, following   
winding paths through thick woods, across gullies, and   
over hills and fields. It was between one and two   
o'clock in the afternoon, and the short winter day was   
wearing away. Winslow saw the position at a glance,   
and, by the promptness of his decision, proved himself a great captain. He ordered an instant assault.   
The Massachusetts troops were in the van; the Plymouth, with the commander-in-chief, in the centre;   
the Connecticut, in the rear. The Indians had erected   
a block-house near the entrance, filled with sharp, who also lined the palisades. The men   
rushed on, although it was into the jaws of death,   
under an unerring fire. The block-house told them   
where the entrance was. The companies of Moseley   
and Davenport led the way. Moseley succeeded in   
passing through. Davenport fell beneath three fatal   
shots, just within the entrance. Isaac Johnson, captain of the Roxbury company, was killed while on the   
log. But death had no terrors to that army. The centre   
and rear divisions pressed up to support the front and   
fill the gaps; and all equally shared the glory of the   
hour. Enough survived the terrible passage to bring   
the Indians to a hand-to-hand fight within the fort.   
After a desperate struggle of nearly three hours, the   
<pb n="122" id="vI122"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1165">   
<figDesc>Page 122.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
savages were driven from their stronghold; and, with   
the setting of that sun, their power was broken.   
Philip's fortunes had received a decided overthrow,   
and the colonies were saved. In all military history,   
there is not a more daring exploit. Never, on any   
field, has more heroic prowess been displayed. By the   
best computations, the Indian loss was at least one   
thousand, including the large numbers who perished   
from cold, as they scattered in their flight without   
shelter, food, or place of refuge. Of the colonial   
force, over eighty were killed, and one hundred and   
fifty wounded. Three of the Massachusetts captains   
&mdash; Johnson, Gardner, and Davenport &mdash; were killed on   
the spot. Three of the Connecticut captains &mdash; John   
Gallop, Samuel Marshall, and Robert Seely &mdash; also fell   
in the fight. Captain William Bradford, of Plymouth,   
was wounded by a musket-ball, which he carried in his   
body to his grave. Captain John Gorham, also of the   
Plymouth colony, was shortly after carried off by a   
fever, occasioned by the over-exhaustion of the march   
and the battle. Lieutenant Phinehas Upham, of Johnson company, was mortally wounded. Great value   
appears to have been attached to the services of this   
officer. In the hurried preparation for the campaign,   
Captain Johnson had nominated his brother as his   
lieutenant. The General Court overruled the appointment. Johnson cheerfully acquiesced, and, in a paper   
addressed to the Court, assured them that he &ldquo;most   
readily submitted to their choice of Lieutenant Upham.&rdquo; This single passage is an imperishable eulogium   
<pb n="123" id="vI123"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1166">   
<figDesc>Page 123.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
upon the characters of the two brave men who   
gave their lives to the country on that fatal but glorious day.</p>   
<p>Captain Gardner's company was raised in this neighborhood. Joseph Peirce and Samuel Pikeworth of   
Salem, and Mark Bachelder of Wenham, were killed   
before entering the fort. Abraham Switchell of Marblehead, Joseph Soames of Cape Ann, and Robert   
Andrews of Topsfield, were killed at the fort. Charles   
Knight, Thomas Flint, and Joseph Houlton, Jr., of   
Salem Village; Nicholas Hakins and John Farrington,   
of Lynn; Robert Cox, of Marblehead; Eben Baker   
and Joseph Abbot, of Andover; Edward Harding, of   
Cape Ann; and Christopher Read, of Beverly, &mdash; were   
wounded. An account of the death of Captain Gardner, in detail, has been preserved. The famous warrior, and final conqueror of King Philip, Benjamin   
Church, was in the fight as a volunteer, rendered efficient service, and was wounded. His &ldquo;History of   
King Philip's War&rdquo; is reprinted, by John Kimball   
Wiggin, as one of his series of elegant editions of rare   
and valuable early colonial publications entitled &ldquo;Library of New England History.&rdquo; In the second number, Part I. of Church's history is edited by Henry   
Martyn Dexter. Church's account of what came   
within his observation in this fight, with the notes of   
the learned editor, is the most valuable source of information we have in reference to it. He says, that,   
in the heat of the battle, he came across Gardner,   
&ldquo;amidst the wigwams in the east end of the fort,   
<pb n="124" id="vI124"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1167">   
<figDesc>Page 124.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
making towards him; but, on a sudden, while they   
were looking each other in the face, Captain Gardner   
settled down.&rdquo; He instantly went to him. The blood   
was running over his cheek. Church lifted up his   
cap, calling him by name. &ldquo;Gardner looked up in   
his face, but spoke not a word, being mortally shot   
through the head.&rdquo; The widow of Captain Gardner   
(Ann, sister of Sir George Downing) became the successor of Ann Dudley, the celebrated poetess of her   
day, by marrying Governor Bradstreet, in 1680. She   
died in 1713.</p>   
<p>There is a curious parallelism between the first and   
the last great victory over the Indian power in the history of America. An interval of one hundred and   
sixty one years separates them. On the 19th of December, 1836, &mdash; the anniversary of the day when Winslow stormed the Narragansett fort, &mdash; Colonel Taylor   
received his orders to pursue the Florida Indians. It   
was a last attempt to subdue them. They had long   
baffled and defied the whole power of the United   
States. Every general in the army had laid down his   
laurels in inglorious and utter failure. He started on   
the 20th, with an army of about one thousand men.   
On the 25th, he found himself on the edge of a swamp,   
impassable by artillery or horses. On the opposite   
side were the Indian warriors, ready to deal destruction, if he should attempt to cross the swamp. He   
had the same question to decide which Winslow had;   
and he decided it in the same way, with equal promptness. The struggle lasted about the same time; and   
<pb n="125" id="vI125"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1168">   
<figDesc>Page 125.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the loss, in proportion to the numbers engaged, was   
about the same. The results were alike permanently   
decisive. Okee-cho-bee stands by the side of Narragansett, and the names of Josiah Winslow and Zachary   
Taylor are imperishably inscribed together on the tablets of military glory.</p>   
<p>Dr. Palfrey says that Captain Nathaniel Davenport   
was a son of &ldquo;Davenport of the Pequot War.&rdquo; He   
was born in Salem, and brought up in the village.   
His name, with those of his brave father, and his associate in youth and in death Joseph Gardner, belongs   
to our local annals. They were both the idols of their   
men. Davenport was dressed, when he fell, in a &ldquo;full   
buff suit,&rdquo; and was probably thought by the Indians   
to be the commander-in-chief. On receiving his triple   
wound, he called his lieutenant, Edward Tyng, to him,   
gave him his gun in charge, delivered over to him the   
command of his company, and died.</p>   
<p>There has been some uncertainty on the point   
whether Nathaniel Davenport was a son of Richard,   
the commandant at the castle. The fact that he was   
associated with William Stoughton, and Stephen Minot   
whose wife was a daughter of Richard Davenport, as   
an administrator of the estate of the latter, has been   
regarded as rendering it probable. Dr. Palfrey's unhesitating statement to that effect is, of itself, enough   
to settle the question. There is, moreover, a document on file which proves that he is correct. Nathaniel widow had some difficulty in settling his estate,   
and applied to the General Court for its interposition.   
<pb n="126" id="vI126"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1169">   
<figDesc>Page 126.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Quite a mass of papers belong to the case. Among   
them is a bill of expenses incurred by her in connection   
with his funeral charges, such as, &ldquo;twenty-one rings to   
relatives,&rdquo; and to those &ldquo;who took care to bring him   
off slain, eight pounds;&rdquo; and &ldquo;for mourning for   
my mother Davenport, sisters Minot and Elliot, and   
myself, sixteen pounds.&rdquo; This latter item is decisive,   
as we know that two of Richard Davenport's daughters   
married persons of those names. It is a circumstance   
of singular interest, as showing by how slight an accident &mdash; for it is a mere accident &mdash; important questions   
of history are sometimes determinable. This item, so   
far as I have been able to find, is the only absolute evidence we have to the point that Richard was the father   
of Nathaniel Davenport; and it would not have been   
in existence, had not questions arisen in the settlement   
of the estate of the latter requiring the action of the   
General Court. The record of baptisms in the First   
Church at Salem, prior to 1636, is lost. The names of   
Richard Davenport's children, baptized subsequent to   
that date, are in the records of the Salem or Boston   
churches. As Nathaniel is understood to have been   
one of the earliest born, the record of his baptism was   
probably in the lost part of the Salem book.</p>   
<p>It may be thought surprising, that so little appears   
to have been known concerning an officer of his rank   
and parentage, and whose death has rendered his name   
so memorable. To account for it, I must recur to the   
history of the Narragansett expedition. No military   
organization was ever more rapidly effected, or more   
<pb n="127" id="vI127"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1170">   
<figDesc>Page 127.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
thoroughly and promptly executed its work. The   
commissioners of the three united colonies were satisfied that the Indian rendezvous at Narragansett,   
where their forces and stores were being collected and   
their resources concentrated, must be struck at without a moment's delay; that the blow must be swift and   
decisive; that it must be struck then, in the depth of   
winter; that, if deferred to the spring, all would be lost;   
that, if the Indian power was allowed to remain and   
to gather strength until the next season, nothing could   
save the settlements from destruction. Early in November, they formed their plan, and put the machinery   
for summoning all their utmost resources into instant   
action. On the 30th of November, the officers appointed for the purpose made return, that they had   
impressed the required number in the several counties   
and towns, fitted them out with arms, ammunition,   
clothes, and all necessary equipments; that the men   
were on the ground, ready to go forward. There   
was no time for recruiting, or raising bounties,   
or substitute brokerage; no time for electioneering to   
get commissions. The rank and file were ready:   
they had been brought in by a process that gave no   
time for canvassing for offices. A summons had been   
left at the house of every drafted man, to report himself   
the next morning. If any one failed to appear, some   
other member of the family, brother or father, had to   
take his place. The organizing and officering of this   
force must be done instanter. All depended upon   
suitable officers being selected. A company was waiting

<figDesc>Page 128.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
at Boston for a captain, and a captain must be   
found. Some one in authority happened to think of   
Nathaniel Davenport. His childhood and youth had   
been passed at Salem Village and on Castle Island:   
on reaching maturity, he had removed to New York,   
and been there for years in commercial pursuits. A   
short time before, he had returned to Boston, and   
engaged in business there. His father had been dead   
since 1665, and not many persons knew him, &mdash; only,   
perhaps, a few of his early associates, and the old   
friends of his father: but they knew, that, from his   
birth to his manhood, he had breathed a military atmosphere, &mdash; was a soldier, by inheritance, of the school   
of Lothrop, Read, and Trask; and it was determined   
at once to hunt him up. He was serving at Court;   
taken out of the jury-box in a pending trial; and   
placed at the head of the company. The accurate historian of Boston, Samuel G. Drake, says, &ldquo;Captain   
Davenport's men were extremely grieved at the death   
of their leader; he having, by his courteous carriage,   
much attached them to himself, although he was a   
stranger to most of them when he was appointed their   
captain. On which occasion he made `a very civil   
speech,' and allowed them to choose their sergeants themselves.&rdquo; He had no time to settle his   
accounts, arrange his affairs, or confer with any one,   
but led his company at once to the rendezvous. These   
circumstances, perhaps, partially explain why so little   
seems to have been known of him in Boston, or to   
local writers.</p>

</p>   
<p>Besides Captains Gardner and Davenport and the   
men whose names have been mentioned as killed or   
wounded, there were in the Narragansett fight the following from Salem Village and its farming neighborhood: John Dodge, William Dodge, William Raymond,   
Thomas Raymond, John Raymond, Joseph Herrick,   
Thomas Putnam, Jr., Thomas Abbey, Robert Leach,   
and Peter Prescott. There may have been others:   
no full roll is on record. The foregoing are gathered   
from partial returns miscellaneously collected in the   
files at the State House. The Dodges (sometimes   
the name is written Dodds, which appears, I think, to   
have been its original form), and the Raymonds (sometimes written Rayment), were, from the first, conspicuous in military affairs. A few words explanatory of   
their relation to the village may be here properly given.</p>   
<p>On the 25th of January, 1635, the town of Salem   
voted to William Trask, John Woodbury, Roger Conant, Peter Palfrey, and John Balch, a tract of land,   
as follows: &ldquo;Two hundred acres apiece together lying,   
being at the head of Bass River, one hundred and   
twenty-four poles in breadth, and so running northerly   
to the river by the great pond side, and so in breadth,   
making up the full quantity of a thousand acres.&rdquo;   
These men were original settlers, having been in the   
country for some time before Endicott's arrival. This   
circumstance gave to them and others the distinguishing title of &ldquo;old planters.&rdquo; The grant of a thousand   
acres, comprising the five farms above mentioned, was   
always known as &ldquo;the Old Planters' Farms.&rdquo; The   
<pb n="130" id="vI130"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1173">   
<figDesc>Page 130.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
first proprietors of them, and their immediate successors, appear to have arranged and managed them in   
concert, &mdash; to have had homesteads near together between the head of Bass River and the neighborhood of   
the &ldquo;horse bridge,&rdquo; where the meeting-house of the   
Second Congregational Society of Beverly, or of the   
&ldquo;Precinct of Salem and Beverly&rdquo; now stands. Their   
woodlands and pasture lands were further to the north   
and east. An inspection of the map will give an idea   
of the general locality of the &ldquo;Old Planters' Farms&rdquo;   
in the aggregate &mdash; above the head of Bass River, extending northerly towards &ldquo;the river,&rdquo; as the Ipswich   
River was called, and easterly to the &ldquo;great pond,&rdquo;   
that is, Wenham Lake. Conant, Woodbury, and   
Balch occupied their lands at once. I have stated how   
Trask's portion of the grant went into the hands of   
Scruggs, and then of John Raymond. Palfrey is   
thought never to have occupied his portion. He sold   
it to William Dodge, the founder of the family of that   
name, known by way of eminence as &ldquo;Farmer Dodge,&rdquo;   
whose wife was a daughter of Conant. A portion of   
the grant assigned to Conant was sold by one of his   
descendants to John Chipman, who, on the 28th of   
December, 1715, was ordained as the first minister   
of the &ldquo;Second Beverly Society.&rdquo; He was the grandfather of Ward Chipman, Judge of the Supreme Court,   
and for some time President, of the Province of New   
Brunswick, and whose son of the same name was   
chief-justice of that court. He was also grandfather   
of the wife of the great merchant, William Gray,   
<pb n="131" id="vI131"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1174">   
<figDesc>Page 131.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
whose family has contributed such invaluable service   
to the literature, legislation, judicial learning, and general welfare of the country. The Rev. Mr. Chipman   
was the ancestor of many other distinguished persons.   
The house in which he lived is still standing, near the   
site of the church in which he preached. It is occupied by his descendants, bearing his name, and, although much time-worn, has the marks of having been   
a structure of a very superior order for that day.   
The venerable mansion stands back from the road,   
on a smooth and beautiful lawn, bordered by a solid   
stone wall of even lines and surfaces. In these respects it well compares with any country residence   
upon which taste, skill, and wealth have, in more   
recent times, been bestowed.</p>   
<p>The dividing line between Beverly and Salem Village, as seen on the map, finally agreed upon in 1703,   
ran through the &ldquo;Old Planters' Farms,&rdquo; particularly   
the portions belonging to the Dodges, Raymonds, and   
Woodbury. It went through &ldquo;Captain John Dodge's   
dwelling-house, six foot to the eastward of his brick   
chimney as it now stands.&rdquo; At the time of the witchcraft delusion, the Raymonds and Dodges mostly   
belonged to the Salem Village parish and church.   
They continued on the rate-list, and connected with   
the proceedings entered on the record-books, until the   
meeting-house at the &ldquo;horse bridge&rdquo; was opened for   
worship, in 1715, when they transferred their relations   
to the &ldquo;Precinct of Salem and Beverly.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>When Sir William Phipps got up his expedition   
<pb n="132" id="vI132"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1175">   
<figDesc>Page 132.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
against Quebec, in 1690, William Raymond raised a   
company from the neighborhood; and so deep was the   
impression made upon the public mind by his ability   
and courage, and so long did it remain in vivid remembrance, that, in 1735, the General Court granted   
a township of land, six miles square, &ldquo;to Captain   
William Raymond, and the officers and soldiers&rdquo; under   
his command, and &ldquo;to their heirs,&rdquo; for their distinguished services in the &ldquo;Canada Expedition.&rdquo; The   
grant was laid out on the Merrimack, but, being found   
within the bounds of New Hampshire, a tract of equivalent value was substituted for it on the Saco River.   
Among the men who served in this expedition was   
Eleazer, a son of Captain John Putnam, who afterwards, for many years, was one of the deacons of the   
Salem Village Church.</p>   
<p>The short, rapid, sharp, and sanguinary campaign   
against the Narragansetts seems to have tried to the   
utmost, not only the courage and spirit of the men,   
but the powers of human endurance. The constitutions of many were permanently impaired. As much   
fatigue and suffering were crowded into that short   
month as the physical forces of strong men could bear.   
We find such entries as this in the town-books: &mdash;   
&ldquo;Salem, 1683. Samuel Beadle, who lost his health in   
the Narragansett Expedition, is allowed to take the   
place of Mr. Stephens as an innkeeper.&rdquo; A petition,   
dated in 1685, is among the papers in the State House,   
signed by men from Lynn, the Village, Beverly, Reading, and Hingham, praying for a grant of land, for   
<pb n="133" id="vI133"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1176">   
<figDesc>Page 133.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
their services and sufferings in that expedition. The   
petition was granted. The following extract from it   
tells the story: &ldquo;We think we have reason to fear   
our days may be much shortened by our hard service   
in the war, from the pains and aches of our bodies, that   
we feel in our bones and sinews, and lameness thereby   
taking hold of us much, especially in the spring and   
fall.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>While there is &ldquo;reason to fear&rdquo; that the days of   
many were shortened, there were some so tough as to   
survive the strain, and bid defiance to aches and pains,   
and almost to time itself. In a list of fourteen who   
went from Beverly, six, including Thomas Raymond and   
Lott, a descendant of Roger Conant, were alive in 1735!</p>   
<p>The grants of land made to these gallant men and   
their heirs amounted in all, and ultimately, to seven   
distinct tracts, called &ldquo;Narragansett Townships.&rdquo;   
They were made in fulfilment of an express public   
promise to that effect. It is stated in an official   
document, that &ldquo;proclamation was made to them, when   
mustered on Dedham Plain&rdquo; on the 9th of December,   
just as they took up their march, &ldquo;that, if they played   
the man, took the fort, and drove the enemy out of the   
Narragansett country, which was their great seat, they   
should have a gratuity in land, besides their wages.&rdquo;   
The same document, which is in the form of a message   
from the House of Representatives to the Council of   
the Province of Massachusetts, dated Jan. 10, 1732,   
goes on to say, &ldquo;And as the condition has been performed, certainly the promise, in all equity and justice,   
<pb n="134" id="vI134"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1177">   
<figDesc>Page 134.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
ought to be fulfilled. And if we consider the difficulties these brave men went through in storming the   
fort in the depth of winter, and the pinching wants   
they afterwards underwent in pursuing the Indians   
that escaped, through a hideous wilderness, known   
throughout New England to this day by the name of   
the <hi rend="italics">hungry march;</hi> and if we further consider, that,   
until this brave though small army thus played the   
man, the whole country was filled with distress and fear,   
and we trembled in this capital, Boston itself; and that   
to the goodness of God to this army we owe our   
fathers' and our own safety and estates,&rdquo; &mdash; therefore   
they urge the full discharge of the obligations of public justice and gratitude. They did not urge in vain.   
The grants were made on a scale, that finally was   
liberal and honorable to the government.</p>   
<p>I have dwelt at this great length on the Narragansett campaign and fight, partly because the details   
have not been kept as familiar to the memory of the   
people as they deserve, but chiefly because they de   
monstrate the military genius of the community with   
whose character our subject requires us to be fully   
acquainted. The enthusiasm of the troops, when   
Winslow gave the order for the assault, was so great,   
that they rushed over the swamp with an eagerness   
that could not be restrained, struggling as in a race to   
see who could first reach the log that led into the fiery   
mouth of the fort. A Salem villager, John Raymond,   
was the winner. He passed through, survived the   
ordeal, and came unharmed out of the terrible fight.   
<pb n="135" id="vI135"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1178">   
<figDesc>Page 135.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
He was twenty-seven years of age. He signed his   
name to a petition to the General Court, in 1685, as   
having gone in the expedition from Salem Village,   
and as then living there. Some years afterwards, he   
removed to Middleborough, joined the church in that   
place in 1722, and died in 1725. The fact that his   
last years were spent there has led to the supposition   
that he went from Middleborough to the Narragansett   
fight; but no men were drafted into that army from   
Middleborough. It was not a town at the time, but   
was organized some years afterwards. It had no inhabitants then. Philip had destroyed what few houses   
had been there, and slaughtered or dispersed their   
occupants.</p>   
<p>Thus far our attention has been directed to that   
portion of the population of Salem Village drawn   
there by the original policy of the company in London   
to attract persons of superior social position, wealth,   
and education to take up tracts of land, and lead the   
way into the interior. It operated to give a high character to the early agriculture of the country, and   
facilitate the settling of the lands. Without taking   
into view the means they had to make the necessary   
outlays in constructing bridges and roads, and introducing costly implements of husbandry and tasteful   
improvements, but looking solely at the social, intellectual, and moral influence they exerted, it must be   
acknowledged that the benefit derived from them was   
incalculable. They gave a powerful impulse to the   
farming interest, and introduced a high tone to the   
<pb n="136" id="vI136"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1179">   
<figDesc>Page 136.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
spirit of the community. They were early on the   
ground, and remained more or less through the period   
of the first generation. Their impress was long seen   
in the manners and character of the people. There   
was surely a goodly proportion of such men among   
the first settlers of this neighborhood.</p>   
<p>I come now to another class drawn along with and   
after the preceding, &mdash; the permanent, substantial yeomanry with no capital but their sturdy industry, doing   
hard work with their strong arms, and striking the   
roots of the settlement down deep into the soil by mixing their own labor with it. A glance at the map will   
be useful, at this point, showing the general direction   
by which the farming population advanced to the interior. All between the North and Cow House Rivers   
was, as now, called North Fields, and is still for the   
most part a farming territory. All north of Cow   
House River, westwardly to Reading and eastwardly to   
the sea, was originally known as the &ldquo;Farms&rdquo; or   
&ldquo;Salem Farms.&rdquo; When the First Beverly Parish was   
set off in 1667, it took from the &ldquo;Farms&rdquo; all east of   
Bass River. As Topsfield and other townships were   
established, they were more or less encroached upon.   
The &ldquo;Farmers&rdquo; as they were called, although unorganized, regarded themselves as one community,   
having a common interest. The tide of settlement   
flowed up the rivers and brooks, sought out the   
meadows, and was drawn into the valleys among the   
hills.</p>   
<p>John Porter, called &ldquo;Farmer Porter,&rdquo; came with   
<pb n="137" id="vI137"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1180">   
<figDesc>Page 137.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
his sons from Hingham, and bought up lands to the   
north of Duck or Crane River. His family before long   
held among them more land, it is probable, than any   
other. He served many years as deputy in the General Court, first from Hingham and then from Salem.   
He is spoken of in the colonial records of Massachusetts as &ldquo;of good repute for piety, integrity, and   
estate.&rdquo; The Barneys, Leaches, and others went eastwardly towards Bass River. The Putnams followed   
up Beaver Brook to Beaver Dam, and spread out towards the north and west; while Richard Hutchinson   
turned southerly to the interval between Whipple   
and Hathorne Hills, bought the Stileman grant, and   
cleared the beautiful meadows where the old village   
meeting-house afterwards stood. He was a vigorous   
and intelligent agriculturist, and a man of character.   
He died in 1681, at eighty years of age, leaving a   
large and well-improved estate. His will has this   
item: I give &ldquo;five acres of land to Black Peter, my   
servant.&rdquo; He had given fine farms to his children   
severally, many years before his death. His second   
wife, who survived him, had no children. He had   
come by her into possession of a valuable addition to   
his estate. After distributing his property, and providing legacies for children and grandchildren, his will   
left it to the option of his widow to spend the residue of her days either in the family of his son Joseph,   
or elsewhere; if she should prefer to live elsewhere,   
then she should receive back, in her own right, all the   
property she had originally owned; if she continued   
<pb n="138" id="vI138"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1181">   
<figDesc>Page 138.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to live to her death in Joseph's family, then her property was to go to him and his heirs. This, I think,   
shows that he was as sagacious as he was just.</p>   
<p>Richard Ingersoll came from Bedfordshire in England in 1629, bringing letters of recommendation   
from Matthew Cradock to Governor Endicott. After   
living awhile in town, a tract of land of eighty acres   
was granted to him, on the east side of Wooleston   
River, opposite the site of Danversport, at a place   
called, after him, Ingersoll's Point. He there proceeded to clear and break ground, plant corn, fence in   
his land, and make other improvements. He also   
carried on a fishery. Subsequently he leased the   
Townsend Bishop farm, where he lived several years.   
He died in 1644. Not long before his death, he purchased, jointly with his son-in-law Haynes, the Weston   
grant. His half of it he bequeathed to his son Nathaniel. He was evidently a man of real dignity and   
worth, enjoying the friendship of the best men of his   
day. Governor Endicott and Townsend Bishop were   
with him in his last sickness, and witnesses to his will.   
His widow married John Knight of Newbury. In a   
legal instrument filed among the papers connected   
with a case of land title, dated twenty-seven years   
after her first husband's death, she expresses in very   
striking language the tender affection and respect   
with which she still cherished his memory.</p>   
<p>William Haynes married Sarah, daughter of Richard   
Ingersoll, and occupied his half of the Weston grant.   
In company with his brother, Richard Haynes, he   
<pb n="139" id="vI139"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1182">   
<figDesc>Page 139.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
had before bought of Townsend Bishop five hundred   
and forty acres, covering a considerable part of the   
northern end of the village territory. They sold one part of it to Abraham Page. Page sold to   
Simon Bradstreet, and John Porter bought all the   
three parts from the Hayneses and Bradstreet. It   
long constituted a portion of the great landed property   
of the Porter family. These facts show that William   
Haynes was a person of means; and the manner in   
which he is uniformly spoken of proves that he was   
regarded with singular respect and esteem. He died   
about 1650, and his son Thomas became subsequently   
a leading man in the village.</p>   
<p>There has been uncertainty where William Haynes   
came from, or to what family of the name he belonged.   
Among the papers of the Ingersoll family, it has   
recently been found that he is mentioned as &ldquo;brother   
to Lieutenant-Governor Haynes.&rdquo; There seems to be   
no other person to whom this language can refer than   
John Haynes, who, after being Governor of Massachusetts, removed to Connecticut where he was governor   
and deputy-governor, in alternate years, to the day of   
his death. John Haynes, as Winthrop informs us,   
was a gentleman of &ldquo;great estate.&rdquo; His property in   
England is stated to have yielded a thousand pounds   
per annum. Dr. Palfrey says he was &ldquo;a man of   
family as well as fortune; and the dignified and courteous manners, which testified to the care bestowed on   
his early nurture, won popularity by their graciousness, at the same time that they diffused a refining   
<pb n="140" id="vI140"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1183">   
<figDesc>Page 140.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
influence by their example.&rdquo; If William of the village   
was brother to John of Connecticut, the fact that he   
and his brother Richard could make such large purchases of lands, and the remarkable respect manifested towards him, are well accounted for. The   
Ingersoll family traditions and entries would seem to   
be the highest authority on such a point.</p>   
<p>Job Swinnerton was a brother of John who for   
many years was the principal physician in the town of   
Salem. He had several grants of land, and was a   
worthy, peaceable, unobtrusive citizen. He seems to   
have kept out of the heat of the various contentions   
that occurred in the village; and, although his influence was sometimes decisively put forth, he evidently   
did nothing to aggravate them. He died April 11,   
1689, over eighty-eight years of age. He had a   
large family, and his descendants continue the name   
in the village to this day. Daniel Rea came originally to Plymouth, and in 1630 bought a dwelling, garden, and &ldquo;all the privileges thereunto   
belonging,&rdquo; in that town. In 1632 he removed   
to Salem, and at once became a leading man in the   
management of town affairs. He had a grant of   
one hundred and sixty acres, which he occupied and   
cultivated till his death in 1662. He had but two children: one, the wife of Captain Lothrop; the other,   
Joshua Rea, became the founder of a large family who   
acted conspicuously in the affairs of the village for   
several generations. Jacob Barney was an original   
grantee, and for several years a deputy. His son of   
<pb n="141" id="vI141"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1184">   
<figDesc>Page 141.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the same name became a large landholder, and, on   
the 5th of April, 1692, at the very moment when the   
witchcraft delusion was at its height, gave two acres   
conveniently situated for the erection of a schoolhouse. He conveyed it to inhabitants of the neighborhood to be used for that purpose, mentioning   
them severally by name. I give the list, as it shows   
who were the principal people thereabouts at the time:   
&ldquo;Mr. Israel Porter; Sergeant John Leach; Cornet   
Nathaniel Howard, Sr.; Corporal Joseph Herrick,   
Sr.; Benjamin Porter; Joshua Rea, Sr.; Thomas   
Raymond, Sr.; Edward Bishop, <hi rend="italics">secundus;</hi> John Trask,   
Jr.; John Creesy; Joshua Rea, Jr.; John Rea; John   
Flint, Sr.&rdquo; Lawrence Leach received a grant of one   
hundred acres; and others of the same name and   
family had similar evidence that they were regarded   
as valuable accessions to the population. William   
Dodge and Richard Raymond had grants of sixty   
acres each; Humphrey and William Woodbury had   
forty each. The families of Leach, Raymond, Dodge,   
and Woodbury, still remain in the community of   
which their ancestors were the founders. John Sibley   
had a grant of fifty acres. Robert Goodell was a   
grantee, and became a large landholder.</p>   
<p>The descendants of the two last-named persons are   
very numerous, and have maintained the respectability of their family names. They are each, at this   
day, represented by gentlemen whose enthusiastic   
interest in our antiquities is proved by their invaluable labors and acquisitions in the interesting departments

of genealogy and local history, &mdash; John L.   
Sibley, Librarian of Harvard University; and Abner   
C. Goodell, Register of Probate for the County of   
Essex.</p>   
<p>Besides Townsend Bishop, there were two other persons of that name among the original inhabitants of   
Salem. They do not appear to have been related to   
him or to each other. Richard Bishop, whose wife   
Dulcibell had died Aug. 6, 1658, married the widow   
Galt, July 22, 1660. He died Dec. 30, 1674.</p>   
<p>Edward Bishop was in Salem in 1639, and became   
a member of the church in 1645. In 1660 he was   
one of the constables of Salem, an original member of   
the Beverly Church in 1667, and died in January,   
1695. He was an early settler on the Farms; his   
lands were on both sides of Bass River, the parcels   
on the west side being above and below the Ipswich   
road. His own residence was on the Beverly side;   
and he was not usually connected with the concerns   
of the village. His name appears but once in the   
witchcraft proceedings, and then in favor of an accused person.</p>   
<p>Edward Bishop, commonly called &ldquo;the sawyer,&rdquo;   
from the tenor of conveyances of land, dates, and   
other evidences, appears to have been a son of the preceding. In his earlier life, he was somewhat notable for   
irregularities and aberrations of conduct. With his   
wife Hannah, he was fined by the local court, in 1653,   
for depredating upon the premises of his neighbors.   
During the subsequent period of his history, he bore

the character of an industrious and reputable person.   
At some time previous to 1680, he married Bridget,   
widow of Thomas Oliver. On the 9th of March, 1693,   
he married Elizabeth Cash. He lived originally in   
Beverly; afterwards, at different times, on the land   
belonging to his father in Salem Village, &mdash; the estate   
he occupied being on both sides of the Ipswich road.   
His last years were passed in the town of Salem. He   
died in 1705. His daughter Hannah, born in 1646,   
became the wife of Captain William Raymond, one of   
the founders of the numerous family of that name.</p>   
<p>Edward Bishop, son of the preceding, called, for   
distinction, &ldquo;husbandman,&rdquo; was born in 1648. He   
married Sarah, daughter of William Wilds, of Ipswich.   
He was a respectable person, and lived in the village   
on an estate also occupied by &ldquo;the sawyer.&rdquo; His   
house was west of the avenue leading to Cherry Hill.   
In 1703 he removed to Rehoboth.</p>   
<p>Edward Bishop, the eldest of his sons, married   
Susanna, daughter of John Putnam, and in 1713 removed to that part of Ipswich now Hamilton. Prior to   
1695, these four Edward Bishops were all living; and   
the youngest had a wife and children. All will be   
found connected with our story, the second and third   
prominently. The fourth owed his safety, perhaps,   
to the influential connections of his wife.</p>   
<p>The first notice we have of Bray Wilkins is in the   
Massachusetts colonial records, Sept. 6, 1638, when   
he was authorized to set up a house and keep a ferry   
at Neponset River, and have &ldquo;a penny a person.&rdquo; On   
<pb n="144" id="vI144"/>

</figure>   
the 5th of November, 1639, the General Court accepted a report made by William Hathorne and   
Richard Davenport, commissioners appointed for the   
purpose, and, in accordance therewith, laid out a farm   
for Richard Bellingham, who had been deputy, was then an assistant, and afterwards governor,   
&ldquo;on the head of Salem, to the north-west of the town;   
there being in it a hill, and an Indian plantation, and   
a pond.&rdquo; This nice little farm included seven hundred   
acres, and &ldquo;about one hundred or one hundred and   
fifty acres of meadow&rdquo; beside. The next thing we   
hear about the matter is a petition to the General   
Court, May 22, 1661, of &ldquo;Bray Wilkins and John   
Gingle, humbly desiring that the farm called by the   
name of Will's Hill, which this Court granted to the   
worshipful Richard Bellingham, Esq., and they purchased of him, may be laid to, and appointed to belong   
to, Salem; being nigh its lands, and the petitioners of   
its society.&rdquo; The Court granted the request. It   
seems that, about a year before, on the 9th of March,   
&ldquo;Bray Wilkins, husbandman, and John Gingle, tailor,   
both of Lynn,&rdquo; had bought the Bellingham farm for   
two hundred and fifty pounds, of which they paid at   
the time twenty-five pounds, and mortgaged it back for   
the residue. The twenty-five pounds was paid as follows: twenty-four pounds in a ton of bar-iron, and   
one pound in money. Wilkins had, some time before,   
removed from Neponset, and perhaps had been working in one of the iron-manufactories then in operation   
at Lynn. When the balance of his wages over his   
<pb n="145" id="vI145"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1188">   
<figDesc>Page 145.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
expenses enabled him, with the aid of Gingle, to raise   
a ton of iron and scrape together twenty shillings, they   
entered upon their bold undertaking. He had not a   
dollar in his pocket; but he had what was better than   
dollars, &mdash; industrious habits, a resolute will, a strong   
constitution, an iron frame, and six stout sons. After   
a while, he took into the work, in addition to his own   
effective family force, two trusty kinsmen, Aaron Way   
and William Ireland, conveying to them good farms   
out of his seven hundred acres. He enlarged his   
farm, from time to time, by new purchases, so as to   
more than make up for what he sold to Way and   
Ireland. In 1676 the mortgage was fully discharged.   
He and his sons bought out the heirs of Gingle, and   
the work was done. They held, free from debt, in one   
tract, a territory about two miles in length on the   
Reading line. Each member of the family had a   
house, barns, orchards, gardens, meadows, upland, and   
woodland; and the homestead of the old patriarch was   
in the midst of them, the enterprise of his laborious   
life crowned with complete success. The innumerable   
family of the name, scattered all over the country,   
has largely, if not wholly, been derived from this   
source. Bray Wilkins, and the members of his household in all its branches, were always on hand at   
parish meetings in Salem Village. Over a distance,   
as their route must have been, of five miles, they   
came, in all seasons and all weathers, by the roughest   
roads, and, in the earlier period, where there were no   
roads at all, through the woods, fording streams, to   
<pb n="146" id="vI146"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1189">   
<figDesc>Page 146.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
meeting on the Lord's Day. He continued vigorous,   
hale, and active to the last; and died, as he truly   
characterizes himself in his will, &ldquo;an ancient,&rdquo; Jan.   
1, 1702, at the age of ninety-two.</p>   
<p>This was the way in which the large grants made to   
wealthy and eminent persons, governors, deputy, and assistants, came into the possession and   
under the productive labor of a yeomanry who made   
good their title to the soil by the force of their characters and the strength of their muscles. One of the   
terms of Wilkins's purchase was, that, if he found and   
wrought minerals on the land, he was to pay to Bellingham or his heirs a royalty of ten pounds per   
annum. Believing that the best mine to be found in   
land is the crops that can be raised from it, he never   
tried to find any other.</p>   
<p>Bray Wilkins will appear to have shared in the   
witchcraft delusion, and been very unhappily connected with it; but he lived to behold its termination,   
and to participate in the restoration of reason. The   
minister of the parish at the time of his death, the   
Rev. Joseph Green, kept a diary which has been preserved. He thus speaks of the old man: &ldquo;He lived   
to a good old age, and saw his children's children, and   
their children, and peace upon our little Israel.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>It is rather curious to notice such indications as the   
mineral clause in Wilkins's deed affords of the prevalent expectation, at the beginning of settlements in this   
region, that valuable minerals would be found in it.   
What makes it worthy of particular inquiry is, that they   
<pb n="147" id="vI147"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1190">   
<figDesc>Page 147.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
were found and wrought for some time, but that no one   
thinks of looking after them now. Simon Bradstreet,   
Daniel Dennison, and John Putnam put up and carried on together, upon a large scale, iron-works, in   
1674, at Rowley Village, now Boxford. Samuel and   
Nathan Leonard were employed to construct them, and   
carried them on by contract. These iron-works were   
long regarded as a promising enterprise and valuable   
investment. The Leonards were probably of the same   
family that, at Raynham and the neighborhood, engaged in this business to a great extent, and for a   
long period, making it a source of wealth and the   
foundation of eminent families. We know that the   
business was carried on extensively in Lynn, and that   
Governor Endicott was quite sure that he had found   
copper on his Orchard Farm. Who knows but that   
modern science and more searching methods of detection may yet discover the hidden treasures of which   
the fathers caught a glimpse, and their enterprises be   
revived and conducted with permanent energy and   
success?</p>   
<p>In 1669, Joseph Houlton testified, that, when he   
was about twenty years of age, in 1641, he was &ldquo;a   
servant to Richard Ingersoll,&rdquo; and worked on his land   
at Ingersoll's Point. About the year 1652, he married   
Sarah, daughter of Richard Ingersoll, and widow of   
William Haynes. By her he had five sons and two   
daughters, who lived to maturity. He gave to each of   
them a farm; and their houses were in his near neighborhood. The sons were respectable and substantial   
<pb n="148" id="vI148"/>

<figDesc>Page 148.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
citizens, and persons of just views and amiable sentiments. The father was one of the honored heads of   
the village, and lived to a good old age. He died   
May 30, 1705. From him, it is probable, all of the   
name in this country have sprung. It will be for ever   
preserved in the public annals and on the geographical   
face of the country. Samuel Houlton, great-grandson   
of the original Joseph, was a representative of Massachusetts for ten years in the old Congress of the Confederation, for a time presiding over its deliberations.   
He was also a member of the first Congress under the   
Constitution, and subsequently, for a very long period,   
Judge of Probate for the county of Essex. He was   
a true patriot and wise legislator; enjoyed to an   
extraordinary degree the confidence and love of the   
people; had a commanding person and a noble and   
venerable aspect; and was always conspicuous by the   
dignity and courtesy of his manners. He was a   
physician by profession; but his whole life was spent   
in the public service. He was in both branches of the   
Legislature of the State, also in the Executive Council.   
He was major of the Essex regiment at the opening of   
the Revolution; was a member of the Committee   
of Safety, and of every convention for the framing of   
the Government; and, for more than thirty years,   
a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He died,   
where he was born and had his home for the greater   
part of his life, in Salem Village, Jan. 2, 1816, in the   
seventy-eighth year of his age.</p>   
<p>In 1724 a petition was presented to the Legislature,   
<pb n="149" id="vI149"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1192">   
<figDesc>Page 149.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
commencing as follows: &ldquo;Whereas Salem is a most   
ancient town of Massachusetts Province, and very   
much straitened for land,&rdquo; the petitioners pray for   
a grant in the western part of the province. The petition was allowed on condition that one lot be reserved   
for the first settled minister, one for the ministry, and   
one for a school. Each grantee was required to give   
a bond of twenty-five pounds to be on the spot; have a   
house of seven feet stud and eighteen square at least,   
seven acres of English hay ready to be mowed, and help   
to build a meeting-house and settle a minister, within   
five years. A grandson of Joseph Houlton, of the   
same name, led the company that emigrated to the assigned location. The first result was the town of New   
Salem, in Franklin County, incorporated in 1753;   
named in honor of the old town from which their leading founder had come. But the people were not satisfied with having merely a school. They must have   
an academy. They went to work with a will, and an   
academy was established and incorporated in 1795.   
This was the second result. The academy did not   
flourish to an extent to suit their views, and they   
beset the Legislature to grant them a township of land   
in the woods of Maine to enable them to endow it.   
They carried their point, and in 1797 obtained the   
grant. The effort had been great, and great was   
the rejoicing at its successful issue. But, as bad luck   
would have it, just at that time land could not be sold   
at any price. The grant became worthless; and deep   
and bitter was the disappointment of the people of   
<pb n="150" id="vI150"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1193">   
<figDesc>Page 150.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
New Salem. The doom of the academy seemed to be   
settled, and its days numbered and finished. But   
there were men in New Salem who were determined   
that the academy should be saved. They met in   
consultation, and, under the lead of still another   
Joseph Houlton, of the same descent, fixed their purpose. They sold or mortgaged their farms, which   
more than half a century of labor had rendered productive, and which every association and every sentiment rendered dear to them. With the money thus   
raised they bought the granted tract, paying a good   
price for it. The preservation and endowment of the   
academy were thus secured; but all benefit from it   
to themselves or their descendants was wholly relinquished. It was the only way in which the academy   
could be saved. Some must make the sacrifice, and   
they made it. They packed up bag and baggage; sold   
off all they could not carry; gathered their families   
together; bid farewell to the scenes of their birth and   
childhood, the homes of their life, and the fruits of   
their labor; and started in wagons and carts on the   
journey to Boston. Their location was hundreds of   
miles distant, far down in the eastern wilderness, and   
inaccessible from the extremes of settlement at that   
time on the Penobscot. As the only alternative, they   
embarked in a coasting-vessel; went down the Bay of   
Fundy to St. John, N.B.; took a river-sloop up to   
Fredericton, &mdash; a hundred miles; got up the river as   
they could, in barges or canoes, eighty miles further   
to Woodstock; and there, turning to the left, struck   
<pb n="151" id="vI151"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1194">   
<figDesc>Page 151.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
into the forest, until they reached their location. The   
third result of this emigration, in successive generations and stages, from Salem Farms, is to be seen to in a handsome and flourishing village, interspersed   
and surrounded with well-cultivated fields, &mdash; the shire   
town of the county of Aroostook, in the State of Maine;   
which bears the name of the leader of this disinterested, self-sacrificing, and noble company. Three times   
was it the lot of this one family to encounter and conquer the difficulties, endure and triumph over the privations, and carry through the herculean labors, of   
subduing a rugged wilderness, and bringing it into   
the domain of civilization, &mdash; at Salem Village, New Salem, and Houlton. It would be difficult to find, in all   
our history, a story that more strikingly than this illustrates the elements of the glory and strength of New   
England, &mdash; zeal for education, &mdash; enterprise invigorated by difficulties, &mdash; and prowess equal to all emergencies.</p>   
<p>John Burton came early to Salem by way of Barbadoes. He combined the pursuits of a farmer and a   
tanner. He was a sturdy old Englishman, who, while   
probably holding the theological sentiments that prevailed in his day, abhorred the spirit of persecution,   
and was unwilling to live where it was allowed to   
bear sway. He does not appear to have been a   
Quaker, but sympathized with all who suffered wrong.   
In 1658, he went off in their company to Rhode   
Island, sharing their banishment. But his conscience   
would not let him rest in voluntary flight. He came   
<pb n="152" id="vI152"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1195">   
<figDesc>Page 152.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
back in 1661, to bear his testimony against oppression.   
He was brought before the Court, as an abettor and   
shelterer of Quakers. He told the justices that they   
were robbers and destroyers of the widows and fatherless, that their priests divined for money, and that   
their worship was not the worship of God. They   
commanded him to keep silent. He commanded them   
to keep silent. They thought it best to bring the colloquy to a close by ordering him to the stocks. They   
finally concluded, upon the whole, to let him alone;   
and he remained here the rest of his life. His descendants are through a daughter (who married William Osborne) and his son Isaac. They are numerous, under both names. Isaac was an active and   
respectable citizen of the village, and a farmer of enterprise and energy. He carried on, under a lease,   
Governor Endicott's farm of over five hundred acres   
on Ipswich River, and had lands of his own. In subsequent generations, this family branched off in various directions to Connecticut, Vermont, and elsewhere.   
One detachment of them went to Wilton, N.H., where   
the family still remains on the original homestead.   
The late Warren Burton, who was born in Wilton, &mdash;   
a graduate of Harvard College in the class of 1821,   
and well known for his invaluable services in the   
cause of education, philanthropy, and letters, &mdash; was a   
direct descendant of John Burton, and as true to the   
rights of conscience as the old tanner, who bearded   
the lion of persecution in the day of his utmost wrath,   
and in his very den.</p>

<p>Henry Herrick, who, as has been stated, purchased   
the Cherry-Hill farm of Alford, was the fifth son of   
Sir William Herrick, of Beau Manor Park, in the parish of Loughborough, in the county of Leicester, England. He came first to Virginia, and then to Salem.   
He was accompanied to America by another emigrant   
from Loughborough, named Cleaveland. Herrick became a member of the First Church at Salem in 1629,   
and his wife Edith about the same time. Their fifth   
son, Joseph, baptized Aug. 6, 1645, owned and occupied Cherry Hill in 1692. He married Sarah, daughter   
of Richard Leach, Feb. 7, 1667. He was a man of   
great firmness and dignity of character, and, in addition to the care and management of his large farm, was   
engaged in foreign commerce. As he bore the title of   
Governor, he had probably been at some time in command of a military post or district, or perhaps of a   
West-India colony. His descendants are numerous,   
and have occupied distinguished stations, often exhibiting a transmitted military stamp. Joseph Herrick   
was in the Narragansett fight. It illustrates the state   
of things at that time, that this eminent citizen, a large   
landholder, engaged in prosperous mercantile affairs,   
and who had been abroad, was, in 1692, when forty years of age, a corporal in the village company.   
He was the acting constable of the place, and, as such,   
concerned in the early proceedings connected with the   
withcraft prosecutions. For a while he was under   
the influence of the delusion; but his strong and enlightened mind soon led him out of it. He was one of   
<pb n="154" id="vI154"/>

<figDesc>Page 154.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the petitioners in behalf of an accused person, when   
intercession, by any for any, was highly dangerous;   
and he was a leader in the party that rose against   
the fanaticism, and vindicated the characters of its   
victims. He inherited a repugnance to oppression,   
and sympathy for the persecuted. His father and   
mother appear, by a record of Court, to have been   
fined &ldquo;for aiding and comforting an excommunicated   
person, contrary to order.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>William Nichols, in 1651, bought two hundred acres,   
which had been granted to Henry Bartholomew, partly   
in the village, but mostly beyond the &ldquo;six-mile extent,&rdquo; and consequently set off to Topsfield. He had   
several other lots of land. He distributed nearly all   
his real estate, during his lifetime, to his son John;   
his adopted son, Isaac Burton; his daughters, the wives   
of Thomas Wilkins and Thomas Cave; and his grand, the wife of Humphrey Case. His only son   
John had several sons, and from them the name has   
been widely dispersed. In a deposition dated May 14,   
1694, William Nichols declares himself &ldquo;aged upwards   
of one hundred years.&rdquo; As his will was offered for   
Probate Feb. 24, 1696, he must have been one hundred   
and two years of age at his death.</p>   
<p>William Cantlebury was a large landholder, having   
purchased three-quarters of the Corwin grant. He   
died June 1, 1663. His name died with him, as he   
had no male issue. His property went to his daughters, who were represented, in 1692, under the names   
of Small, Sibley, and Buxton. The Flints, Popes,

Uptons, Princes, Phillipses, Needhams, and Walcotts,   
had valuable farms, and appear, from the records and   
documents, to have been respectable, energetic, and intelligent people. Daniel Andrew was one of the   
strong men of the village; had been a deputy to the   
General Court, and acted a prominent part before and   
after the witchcraft convulsion. But the great family   
of the village &mdash; greater in numbers and in aggregate   
wealth than any other, and eminently conspicuous on   
both sides in the witchcraft proceedings &mdash; remains to   
be mentioned.</p>   
<p>John Putnam had a grant of one hundred acres,   
Jan. 20, 1641. With his wife Priscilla, he came from   
Buckinghamshire, England, and was probably about   
fifty years of age on his arrival in this country. He   
was a man of great energy and industry, and acquired   
a large estate. He died in 1662, leaving three sons, &mdash;   
Thomas, born in 1616; Nathaniel, in 1620; and John,   
in 1628. For a more convenient classification, I shall,   
in speaking of this family, refer, not to the original   
John at all, but to the sons as its three heads.</p>   
<p>Thomas, the eldest, inherited a double share of his   
father's lands. He was of age when he came to America, and had received a good education. He appears   
to have settled, in the first instance, in Lynn, where   
for several years he acted as a magistrate, holding local   
courts, by appointment of the General Court. Upon   
removing to Salem, he was chosen, as the town-records   
show, to the office of constable. This was considered   
at that time as quite a distinguished position, carrying   
<pb n="156" id="vI156"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1199">   
<figDesc>Page 156.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
with it a high authority, covering the whole executive local administration. Thomas Putnam was   
the first clerk of Salem Village, and acted prominently in military, ecclesiastical, and municipal affairs.   
He seems to have been a person of a quieter temperament than his younger brothers, and led a somewhat   
less stirring life. Possessing a large property by inheritance, he was not quite so active in increasing it;   
but, enjoying the society and friendship of the leading   
men, lived a more retired life. At the same time,   
he was always ready to serve the community if   
called for, as he often was, when occasion arose   
for the aid of his superior intelligence and personal   
influence. He married first, while in Lynn, Ann,   
daughter of Edward Holyoke, great-grandfather of the   
President of Harvard College of that name whose   
son, the venerable centenarian, Dr. Edward Augustus   
Holyoke, is remembered as a true Christian philosopher by the generation still lingering on the   
stage. Having lost his wife on the 1st of September, 1665, he married, on the 14th of November,   
1666, Mary, widow of Nathaniel Veren; coming,   
through her, into possession of property in Jamaica   
and Barbadoes, in which places Veren had resided,   
more or less, in the prosecution of commercial   
business. His homestead, as shown on the map,   
was occupied by his widow in 1692, and, after   
her death, by her son Joseph, the father of General   
Israel Putnam. He had also a town residence   
on the north side of Essex Street, extending back to   
<pb n="157" id="vI157"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1200">   
<figDesc>Page 157.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the North River. Its front on Essex Street embraced   
the western part of the grounds now occupied by the   
North Church, and extended to a point beyond the   
head of Cambridge Street. He left the eastern half of   
this property to his son Thomas, and the western half   
to his son Joseph. To his son Edward he left another   
estate in the town, on the western side of St. Peter's   
Street, to the north of Federal Street.</p>   
<p>Thomas Putnam died on the 5th of May, 1686. He   
left large estates in the village to each of his children,   
and a valuable piece of meadow land, of fifteen acres,   
to a faithful servant.</p>   
<p>Nathaniel Putnam married Elizabeth, daughter of   
Richard Hutchinson, and, besides what he received   
from his father, came, through his wife, into possession   
of seventy-five acres. On that tract he built his house   
and passed his life. The property has remained uninterruptedly in his family. One of them, the late   
Judge Samuel Putnam, of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, enjoyed it as a country residence, and it is   
still held by his children. Nathaniel Putnam was a   
deputy to the General Court, and constantly connected   
with all the interests of the community. He had great   
business activity and ability, and was a person of extraordinary powers of mind, of great energy and skill   
in the management of affairs, and of singular sagacity,   
acumen, and quickness of perception. He died July   
23, 1700, leaving a numerous family and a large estate.</p>   
<p>John Putnam had the same indefatigable activity as

Nathaniel. He was often deputy to the General Court,   
and accumulated a very great landed property. He   
married Rebecca Prince, step-daughter of John Gedney,   
and died on the 7th of April, 1710. He was buried   
with military honors. He left a large family of sons   
and daughters. We shall often meet him in our narrative, and gather the materials, as we go along, to   
form an opinion of his character. The earliest rate in the parish record book is for 1681. At that   
time the three brothers were all living; the aggregate   
sum assessed upon ninety-four names was two hundred   
pounds. The rate of Thomas was &pound;10. 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 3<hi rend="italics">d.;</hi> that   
of Nathaniel, &pound;9. 10<hi rend="italics">s.;</hi> that of John, &pound;8. No other   
person paid as much as either of them.</p>   
<p>These brothers, as well as many others of the large   
landholders in the village, adopted the practice of giving to their sons and sons-in-law, outright, by deed,   
good farms, as soon as they became heads of families;   
so that, as the fathers advanced in life, their own estates were gradually diminished; and, when unable any   
longer to take an active part in managing their lands,   
they divided up their whole remaining real estate, making careful contracts with their children for an adequate maintenance, to the extent of their personal   
wants and comfort. Joseph Houlton did this: so did   
the widow Margery Scruggs, old William Nichols, Francis Nurse, and many others. In his last years, John   
Putnam was on the rate-list for five shillings only,   
while all his sons and daughters were assessed severally in large sums. In this way they had the satisfaction   
<pb n="159" id="vI159"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1204">   
<figDesc>Page 159.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of making their children independent, and of seeing them take their places among the heads of the   
community.</p>   
<p>Where this practice was followed, there were few   
quarrels in families over the graves of parents, and   
controversies seldom arose about the provisions of wills.   
In some cases no wills were needed to be made. It is   
apparent, that, in many respects, this was a wise and   
good practice. It was, moreover, a strictly just one.   
As the sons were growing to an adult age, they added,   
by their labors, to the value of lands, &mdash; inserted a   
property into them that was truly their own; and their   
title was duly recognized. In a new country, land has   
but little value in itself; the value is imparted by the   
labor that clears it and prepares it to yield its products.   
In 1686, Nathaniel Putnam testified that for more than   
forty years he had lived in the village, and that in the   
early part of that time unimproved land brought only   
a shilling an acre, while a cow was worth five pounds.   
In 1672, the rate of taxation on unimproved land was   
a half penny per acre, and, for land on which labor had   
been expended, a penny per acre. In 1685 it was taxed   
at the rates of three shillings for a hundred acres of wild   
land, and one penny an acre for &ldquo;land within fence.&rdquo;   
The relative value of improved land constantly increased with the length of time it had been under culture. It may be said that labor added two-thirds to   
the value of land, and that he who by the sweat of his   
brow added those two-thirds, to that extent owned the   
land. An industrious young man went out into his   
<pb n="160" id="vI160"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1205">   
<figDesc>Page 160.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
father's woods, cut down the trees, cleared the ground,   
fenced it in, and prepared it for cultivation. All that   
was thus added to its value was his creation, and he   
its rightful owner. The right was recognized, and full   
possession given him, by deed, as soon as he had   
opened a farm, and built a house, and brought a wife   
into it.</p>   
<p>The effect of this was to anchor a family, from   
generation to generation, fast to its ancestral acres.   
It strengthened the ties that bound them to their   
native fields. Its moral effect was beyond calculation.   
When a young man was thus enabled to start in life   
on an independent footing, it made a man of him   
while he was young. It invested him with the dignity   
of a citizen by making him feel his share of responsibility for the security and welfare of society. It gave   
scope for enterprise, and inspiration to industry, at   
home. It led to early marriages, under circumstances that justified them. Joseph Putnam, the   
youngest son of Thomas, at the age of twenty years   
and seven months, took as his bride Elizabeth, daughter of Israel Porter, and grand-daughter of William   
Hathorne, when she was sixteen years and six months   
old. We shall see what a valuable citizen he became;   
and she was worthy of him. A large and noble   
family of children grew up to honor them, one of the   
youngest of whom was Israel Putnam, of illustrious   
Revolutionary fame.</p>   
<p>Though there were descendants of this family in   
every company of emigrants that went forth from   
<pb n="161" id="vI161"/>

Salem Village, in all directions, in every generation,   
to Yarmouth Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine,   
and all parts of the New England, Middle, Western,   
and Pacific States, there is about as large a proportionate representation of the name within the precincts of   
Salem Village to-day, as there ever was. Fifty Putnams are at present voters in Danvers, on a list of   
eight hundred names, &mdash; one-sixteenth of the whole   
number. The rate-schedule of 1712 shows almost   
precisely the same proportion.</p>   
<p>Edward Putnam, whom we shall meet again, was baptized July 4, 1654. After serving as deacon of the   
church from its organization, a period of forty years,   
he resigned on account of advancing age; and in 1733,   
as he was entering on his eightieth year, gave this   
account of his family: &ldquo;From the three brothers proceeded twelve males; from these twelve males, forty   
males; and from these forty males, eighty-two males:   
there were none of the name of Putnam in New England but those from this family.&rdquo; With respect to   
their situation in life, he remarks: &ldquo;I can say with   
the Psalmist, I have been young, and now am old;   
yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor their   
seed begging bread except of God, who provides for   
all. For God hath given to the generation of my   
fathers a generous portion, neither poverty nor   
riches.&rdquo; When the infirmities of age prevented his   
longer partaking in the worship of the Lord's Day,   
this good old man relinquished his residence near the   
church, and removed to his original homestead, in   
<pb n="162" id="vI162"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1207">   
<figDesc>Page 162.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the neighborhood of his children, which had then been   
included in the new town of Middleton. His will is   
dated March 11, 1731. It was offered in Probate,   
April 11, 1748. After making every reasonable deduction, in view of his share of responsibility for the ear   
lier proceedings in the witchcraft prosecutions, we may   
participate in the affection and veneration with which   
this amiable and gentle-hearted man was regarded by   
his contemporaries.</p>   
<p>The provisions of his will contain items which so   
strikingly illustrate his character, and give us such an   
insight of the domestic life of the times, that a few of   
them will be presented. According to the prevalent   
custom, he had given good farms to his several children when they became heads of families. In his   
will, he distributes the residue of his real estate among   
them with carefulness and an equal hand, describing   
the metes and bounds of the various tracts with great   
minuteness, so as to prevent all questions of controversy among them. He gives legacies in money to his   
daughters, ten pounds each; and, to his grand, five pounds each. To one of his five sons, he   
gives his &ldquo;cross-cut saw.&rdquo; This was used to saw large   
logs crosswise, having two handles worked by two persons, and distinguished from the &ldquo;pit saw,&rdquo; which was   
used to saw logs lengthwise. All his other tools were   
to be divided among his sons, to one of whom he also   
gives his cane; to another, his &ldquo;Great Bible;&rdquo;   
to another, &ldquo;Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs's Works;&rdquo; to   
another, &ldquo;Mr. Flavel's Works;&rdquo; and, to the other, his   
<pb n="163" id="vI163"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1208">   
<figDesc>Page 163.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
&ldquo;girdle and sword.&rdquo; To one of them he gives his desk,   
and &ldquo;that box wherein are so many writings;&rdquo; to another, his &ldquo;share in the iron-works;&rdquo; and to another,   
his share &ldquo;in the great timber chain.&rdquo; This, with other   
evidence, shows that there was a boom, and arrangements on a large scale for the lumbering business, at   
that time, on Ipswich River. The provisions for his wife   
were very considerate, exact, and minute, so as to prevent all possibility of there being any difficulty in reference to her rights, or of her ever suffering want or   
neglect. He gives to her, absolutely and for her own   
disposal, the residue of his books and all his &ldquo;movable   
estate&rdquo; in the house and out of it, including all   
&ldquo;cattle, sheep, swine,&rdquo; the whole stock of the homestead farm, agricultural implements, and carriages.   
He makes it the duty of one of his sons to furnish her   
with all the &ldquo;firewood&rdquo; she may want, with ten bushels of corn-meal, two bushels of English meal, four   
bushels of ground malt, four barrels of good cider, &mdash;   
he to find the barrels &mdash; as many apples &ldquo;as she shall   
see cause,&rdquo; and nine or ten score weight of good pork,   
annually: he was to &ldquo;keep for her two cows, winter   
and summer,&rdquo; and generally to provide all &ldquo;things   
needful.&rdquo; The will specifies, apartment by apartment, from cellar to garret, one-half of the house,   
to be for her accommodation, use, and exclusive control, and half of the garden. The sons were to pay,   
in specified proportions, all his funeral charges. One   
of the sons was to pay her forthwith four pounds in   
money; and they were severally to deliver to her annually,   
<pb n="164" id="vI164"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1209">   
<figDesc>Page 164.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in proportions expressly stated, ten pounds for   
pocket money. When the relative value of money at   
that time is considered, and the other particulars above   
named taken into account, it will be allowed that   
he was faithful and wise in caring for the wife of his   
youth and the companion of his long life. There is no   
better criterion of the good sense and good feeling of   
a person than his last will and testament. The result   
of a quite extensive examination is a conviction that   
the application of this test to the early inhabitants of   
Salem Village is most creditable to them, particularly   
in the tender but judicious and effectual manner in   
which the rights, comfort, independence, and security   
of their wives were provided for.</p>   
<p>In the third generation, the three Putnam families   
began to give their sons to the general service of the   
country in conspicuous public stations, and in the professional walks of life. Their names appear on the   
page of history and in the catalogues of colleges.   
Major-General Israel Putnam was a grandson of the   
first Thomas. On the 14th of May, 1718, Archelaus,   
a grandson of John, and son of James, died at Cambridge, while an undergraduate. Benjamin, a son of   
Nathaniel, in his will, presented for Probate, April 25,   
1715, says, &ldquo;I give my son Daniel one hundred and   
fifty pounds for his learning.&rdquo; Daniel lived and died   
in the ministry, at North Reading. His name heads   
the list of more than thirty &mdash; all, it is probable, of this   
family &mdash; in the last Triennial Catalogue of Harvard   
University.</p>

<p>The brightest name in the annals of Salem Village,   
though frequently referred to, has not yet been presented for your contemplation. I shall hold it up and   
keep it in your view by a somewhat detailed description, not only because it is necessary to a full understanding of our subject, but because it is good to gaze   
upon a life of virtue; to pause while beholding a portrait beaming with beneficence, and radiant with all   
excellent, beautiful, and attractive affections.</p>   
<p>Nathaniel Ingersoll was about eleven years old at   
the death of his father. His mother married John   
Knights, of Newbury, who became the head of her   
household, and continued to carry on the Townsend   
Bishop farm for several years. Governor Endicott,   
the friend and neighbor of Richard Ingersoll, took   
Nathaniel, while still a lad, into his family. In a deposition made in Court, June 24, 1701, Nathaniel Ingersoll says, &ldquo;I went to live with Governor Endicott as his   
servant four years, on the Orchard Farm.&rdquo; At that   
time, the term &ldquo;servant&rdquo; had no derogatory sense   
connected with it. It merely implied the relations   
between an employer and the employed, without the   
least tint of the feeling which we associate with the   
condition of servility. Here was a youth, who, by his   
father's will, was the owner of a valuable estate of   
seventy-five acres in the immediate neighborhood, voluntarily seeking the privilege of entering the service   
of his father's friend, because he thereby would be   
better qualified, when old enough, to enter upon his   
own estate. Governor Endicott's political duties were   
<pb n="166" id="vI166"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1211">   
<figDesc>Page 166.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
not then regarded as requiring him to live in Boston;   
and his usual residence was at the Orchard Farm,   
where he was making improvements and conducting   
agricultural operations upon so large a scale that   
it was the best school of instruction anywhere to be   
found for a young person intending to make that   
his pursuit in life. Young John Putnam, as has been   
stated, was there for the same purpose, under similar   
circumstances.</p>   
<p>Having built a house and barn, and provided the   
necessary stock and materials, Nathaniel Ingersoll   
went upon his farm when about nineteen years of   
age. Soon after, probably, he married Hannah Collins   
of Lynn, who, during their long lives, proved a worthy   
helpmeet. His house was on a larger scale than was   
usual at that time. One of its rooms is spoken of as   
very large; and the uses to which his establishment   
was put, from time to time, prove that it must have   
had capacious apartments. Its site is shown on the   
map. The road from Salem to Andover passed it,   
not at an angle as now, but by a curve. The present   
parsonage of Danvers Centre stands on the lot. But   
Ingersoll's house was a little in the rear of the site   
occupied by the present parsonage. It faced south.   
In front was an open space, or lawn, called Ingersoll's   
Common. Here he lived nearly seventy years. During that long period, his doors were ever open to   
hospitality and benevolence. His house was the   
centre of good neighborhood and of all movements for   
the public welfare. His latch-string was always out   
<pb n="167" id="vI167"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1212">   
<figDesc>Page 167.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
for friend or stranger. In a military sense, and every   
other sense, it was the head-quarters of the village.   
On his land, a few rods to the north-east, stood the   
block-house where watch was kept against Indian   
attacks. There a sentinel was posted day and night,   
under his supervision. The spot was central to the   
several farming settlements; and all meetings of every   
kind took place there. To accommodate the public, he   
was licensed to keep a victualling-house; also to sell   
beer and cider by the quart &ldquo;on the Lord's Day.&rdquo;   
This last provision was for the benefit of those who   
came great distances to meeting, and had to find   
refreshment somewhere between the services. To meet   
the occasions arising out of this business, he probably   
had a separate building. Indeed, the evidence, in the   
language used in reference to it, is quite decisive that   
there was an &ldquo;ordinary,&rdquo; distinct from the dwelling. The location was thought to render such an   
establishment necessary, and his character secured its   
orderly maintenance.</p>   
<p>Travellers through the country stopped at &ldquo;Nathaniel Ingersoll's corner.&rdquo; The earliest path or roadway   
to and from the eastern settlements went by it. Here   
Increase and Cotton Mather, and all magistrates and   
ministers, were entertained. Here the wants of the   
poor and unfortunate were made known, and all men   
came for counsel and advice. From the first, even when   
he had not reached the age of maturity, he commanded   
to a singular extent the confidence and respect of all   
men. The influence of his bearing and character,   
<pb n="168" id="vI168"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1213">   
<figDesc>Page 168.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
thus early established, was never lost or abated, or   
disturbed for a moment during his long life. He was   
the umpire to settle all differences, but never made an   
enemy by his decisions. Although of moderate estate,   
compared with some of his neighbors, they all treated   
him with a deference greater than they sometimes   
paid to each other. It was his lot to be mixed   
up with innumerable controversies, to be in the very   
centre of the most vehement and frightful social convulsions, and to act decisively in some of them; but   
it is most marvellous to witness how uniform and universal was the consideration in which he was held.   
These statements are justified abundantly by evidence   
in records and documents.</p>   
<p>When village business was to be transacted, or   
consultation of any kind had, the house of Deacon   
Ingersoll was designated, as a matter of course, for   
the place of meeting. Whether it was an ecclesiastical or a military gathering, a prayer-meeting or a   
train-band drill, it was there. Before they had a   
meeting-house, it cannot be doubted, they met for   
worship in his large room. We find it recorded, that,   
after the meeting-house was built, if from the bitterness of the weather, or any other cause, it was too   
uncomfortable to remain in, they would adjourn to   
Deacon Ingersoll's. Such a free use of a particular   
person's premises sometimes engenders a familiarity   
that runs into license, and is apt to breed contempt.   
Not so at all in his case. There was a native-born   
dignity, an honest manliness and pervading integrity   
<pb n="169" id="vI169"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1214">   
<figDesc>Page 169.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
about him, that were appreciated by all persons at all   
times. When wrong was meditated, his admonition   
was received with respectful consideration; when it   
had been committed, his rebuke awakened no resentment. The fact, that he was acknowledged and felt   
by all to be a perfectly just man, is apparent through   
the whole course of his action in all the affairs of life.   
His uprightness, freedom from unworthy prejudice,   
and clear and transparent conscientiousness, appear   
in all documents, depositions, and records that proceeded from him. He was often called to give   
evidence in land causes and other trials at law; and   
his testimony is always straightforward, fair, and   
lucid. You can tell from the style, temper, or tone   
of other witnesses, which side of the controversy they   
espoused, but not from his. In the great and protracted conflict in the courts, relating to the Townsend   
Bishop farm, he and all his most intimate connections   
and relatives were parties of adverse interest; but   
Zerubabel Endicott paid homage, and left it on record,   
to the truthfulness and uprightness of the testimony   
and the fairness of the course of Nathaniel Ingersoll.   
We shall meet other illustrations to the same effect in   
the course of our narrative.</p>   
<p>Although it is anticipating the course of events, it   
may be well to trace the outlines of the life of this   
man to its distant close. Partaking of the general   
views of his age, he participated in the proceedings   
that led to the witchcraft prosecutions. He believed   
in what was regarded as decisive evidence against the   
<pb n="170" id="vI170"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1215">   
<figDesc>Page 170.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
accused, and acted accordingly. But no one ever felt   
that there was any vindictiveness in his course.</p>   
<p>He lived to see the storm that desolated his beloved   
village pass away, and to enjoy the restoration of   
reason, peace, and good-will among a people who had   
so long been torn by strife, and subjected to untold   
horrors, &mdash; horrors that have never yet been fully described, and which I despair of being able adequately   
to depict. He did all that a good and true man could   
do to eradicate the causes of the mischief. He participated in the exercises of a day of Thanksgiving,   
set apart for the purpose, in 1700, to express the devout and contrite gratitude of the people to a merciful   
God for deliverance from the errors and passions that   
had overwhelmed them with such awful judgments.   
The removal of Mr. Parris having been effected,   
Joseph Green was settled near the close of the year   
1697. He was a wise and prudent man. By kind,   
cautious, and well-timed measures, he gradually succeeded in extracting every root of bitterness, healing   
all the breaches, and restoring harmony to a long people. In this work, Deacon Ingersoll and   
his good associate, Edward Putnam, aided him to the   
utmost. When, by their united counsels and labors,   
the difficult work was about accomplished, Mr. Green   
was taken to his reward, in 1715. Greatly was he   
lamented; but Nathaniel Ingersoll had realized all his   
best wishes at last. The prayers he had poured forth   
for fifty years had been answered. He had seen the   
completed service of a pastor who had fulfilled his   
<pb n="171" id="vI171"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1216">   
<figDesc>Page 171.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
highest estimate of what a Christian minister should   
be. He lived to witness and share in the warm and   
unanimous welcome of Peter Clark to a useful, honored, happy ministry which lasted more than half a   
century. The ordination of Mr. Clark, which took   
place on the 8th of June, 1717, was made the occasion   
of demonstrating the complete re-establishment of   
social harmony and Christian love throughout that   
entire community. The storms of strife had commenced with the settlement of the first minister, more   
than forty years before: they had increased in violence, until, at the witchcraft delusion, they swept in a   
ternado every thing to ruin. The clouds had been   
slowly dispersed, and the angry waves smoothed   
down, by Mr. Green's benignant ministry. The long,   
and yet unbroken, &ldquo;era of good feeling&rdquo; was fully   
inaugurated. It was a day of great rejoicing. Old   
men and matrons, young men and maidens, met   
together in happy union. Tradition says that they   
carried their grateful festivities to the highest point   
allowable by the proprieties of that period. Having   
witnessed this scene, and beheld the church and village of his affections start on a new and sure career of   
peace and prosperity, the Good Parishioner folded his   
mantle and departed from sight. He died in 1719, in   
his eighty-fifth year. He was truly the &ldquo;Man of   
Ross.&rdquo; The celebrated portrait, which poetry has   
drawn under this name, was from an actual example   
in real life, not more shining than his. He left no   
issue; but his brothers were the founders of a family   
<pb n="172" id="vI172"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1217">   
<figDesc>Page 172.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
widely diffused, many members of which have, in   
every subsequent age, contributed to the honor of the   
name. Innumerable branches have spread out from   
the same stock under other names. The children of   
the late Dr. Nathaniel Bowditch, through both father   
and mother, have descended from a brother of Nathaniel Ingersoll.</p>   
<p>Citations and extracts from documents on file will   
justify all I have said of this man.</p>   
<p>His wife was a spirit kindred to his own. Their   
only child, a daughter, died when quite young.   
Their hearts demanded an object on which to exercise   
parental affection, and to give opportunity for benevolent care, within their own household; and they induced their neighbor, Joseph Hutchinson, who had   
several sons, to give one of them to be theirs by adoption. When this child had grown to manhood, a deed   
was recorded in the Essex Registry, Oct. 2, 1691, of   
which this is the purport: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Benjamin Hutchinson, being an infant when he was   
given to us by his parents, we have brought him up as our   
own child; and he, the said Benjamin, living with us as an   
obedient son, until he came of one and twenty years of age,   
he then marrying from us, I, the said Nathaniel Ingersoll, and   
Hannah, my wife, on these considerations, do, upon the marriage of our adopted son, Benjamin Hutchinson, give and   
bequeath to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, this deed   
of gift of ten acres of upland, and also three acres of

<p>When Mr. Parris was settled, it occurred to Deacon

Ingersoll, that it would be very convenient for him to   
have a certain piece of ground between the parsonage   
land and the Andover road; and he gave him a deed,   
from which the following is an extract. It is dated   
Jan. 2, 1689.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;To all Christian people to whom this present writing   
shall come, Nathaniel Ingersoll, of Salem Village, in the   
county of Essex, sendeth greeting. Know ye, that the said   
Nathaniel Ingersoll, husbandman, and Hannah, his wife, for   
and in consideration of the love, respect, and honor which   
they justly bear unto the public worship of the true and only   
God, and therefore for the encouragement of their well pastor, the Rev. Samuel Parris, who hath lately   
taken that office amongst them, and also for and in consideration of a very small sum of money to them in hand paid,   
with which they do acknowledge themselves fully contented   
and satisfied, do grant to said Samuel Parris and Elizabeth,   
his wife, for life, and then to the children of said Samuel and   
Elizabeth Parris, four and a half acres of land, adjoining   
upon the home field of the said Nathaniel Ingersoll; the   
three acres on the south alienated by gift, and the remainder by sale.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>There was a fine young orchard on the land.</p>   
<p>Joseph Houlton had conveyed to the parish a lot for   
the use of the ministry, attached to the parsonage   
house. A question having arisen in consequence of a   
lost deed, or some other imagined defect in the Houlton title, whether the land originally belonged to him   
or to Nathaniel Ingersoll, the latter disposed of it at   
once by an instrument recorded in the Essex Registry,   
of which the following is the substance: &mdash;</p>

</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Nathaniel Ingersoll to the Trustees of Salem Village   
Ministry land, for divers good causes and considerations me   
thereunto moving, but more especially for the true love and   
desire I have to the peace and welfare of Salem Village   
wherein I dwell, I hereby release, &amp;c., all my right and title   
to five acres described in my brother Houlton's deed of   
sale,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p></q>   
<p>In the same Registry, the following extract is found,   
in a deed dated Jan. 28, 1708: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;For the desire I have that children may be educated in   
Salem Village, I freely give four poles square of land to Rev.   
Joseph Green, to have and to hold the same, not for his own   
particular use, but for the setting a schoolhouse upon, and   
the encouragement of a school in this place.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The Essex Registry has a deed dated Jan. 6, 1714,   
of which the following is the substance: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;For the good affection that I bear unto Deacon Edward   
Putnam, and the desire that I have of his comfortable attendance upon the public worship of God, I have freely given   
unto him, the said Deacon Edward Putnam, of Salem   
aforesaid, for him and his heirs for ever, a piece of land,   
bounded northerly upon the land of Joseph Green, next to   
his orchard gate, westerly on the highway, and southerly and   
easterly on my land.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Deacon Putnam was, at this time, sixty years of age.   
His homestead was at some distance; and it was often   
difficult for him to get to meeting. Ingersoll had   
always enjoyed the convenience of having only a few   
rods to go to the place of worship; and he desired to   
<pb n="175" id="vI175"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1220">   
<figDesc>Page 175.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
have his beloved colleague enjoy the same privilege.   
Besides, he longed to have him near. The proffer was   
probably accepted. We find that church-meetings   
were held at the house of Deacon Putnam, which   
would not probably so often have been the case, had   
he remained on his farm; and we know that there   
were two dwelling-houses, some time afterwards, on   
the Ingersoll lot. It was a pleasant arrangement: the   
two deacons and the minister being thus brought close   
together, and reaching each other through Ingersoll's   
garden and the minister's orchard. Of the personal   
friendship, attachment, and genial affection between   
the two good old deacons, the foregoing extract is a   
pleasing illustration.</p>   
<p>Nathaniel Ingersoll's property was never very large;   
and, as he had enjoyed the luxury, all his life long,   
of benevolence and beneficence, there was no great   
amount to be left after suitably providing for his wife.   
But there was enough to enable him to express the   
family affection to which he was always true, and to   
give a parting assurance of his devotion to the church   
and people of the village. By his will, certain legacies were required to be paid by the residuary legatee   
and final heir within a reasonable time specified in the   
document. It bears date July 8, 1709, and was   
offered for Probate, Feb. 17, 1719. It begins thus: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;In the name of God, Amen. I, Nathaniel Ingersoll, of   
Salem, in the county of Essex, in the Province of Massachutetts Bay, in New England, being through God's mercy   
in good health of body and of perfect memory, but not   
<pb n="176" id="vI176"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1221">   
<figDesc>Page 176.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
knowing how soon my great change may come, do make   
this my last will, in manner and form following: First, I   
give up my soul to God, in and through Jesus Christ my   
Redeemer, when he shall please to call for it, hoping for a   
glorious resurrection, in and through his merits; and my   
body to decent burial, at the discretion of my executors;   
and, as for the worldly estate God hath been pleased to give   
me, I dispose of it in the manner following,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p></q>   
<p>He gives a small sum of money, varying from thirty   
shillings to four pounds, to each and every nephew and   
niece then living, twenty-two in number. He provides   
for an annuity of twenty shillings a year for a sister,   
the only remaining member of his own immediate family, to be paid into the hands of the daughter who took   
care of her. Not being able to leave a large amount   
to any, he preferred to express his love for all. There   
were two items in the will which may be specially preserved from oblivion.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;I give to the church in Salem Village the sum of fifty   
shillings in money, for the more adorning the Lord's Table, to be laid out in some silver cup, at the discretion of the   
Pastor, Deacons, and my overseers.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;After my wife's   
decease, I give to Benjamin (my adopted son) who was very   
dutiful to me, while he lived with me, and helpful to me   
since he has gone from me, all the remaining part of my   
whole estate, both real and personal, &mdash; excepting a small   
parcel of land of about two acres, that lyeth between Mrs.   
Walcots and George Wyotts by the highway, which I give   
to the inhabitants of Salem Village, for a training place for   
ever.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<pb n="177" id="vI177"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1222">   
<figDesc>Page 177.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>The bonds required of the executors by the Probate   
Court were to the amount of two hundred pounds only,   
showing that his movable or personal estate was a   
very moderate one. There is a feature in the will,   
which is, I think, worthy of being mentioned, as evincing the excellent judgment and practical wisdom of   
this man.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;I give to Hannah, my well-beloved wife, the use and   
improvement of my whole estate during her natural life:   
and my will is, that, if my wife should marry again, he that   
she so marrieth, before she marry, shall give sufficient security to my overseers not to make strip or waste upon any of   
my estate; and, if he do not become so bound, I give one of my whole estate to Benjamin Hutchinson, at the   
time of my wife's marriage.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>He did not cut her off entirely, as is sometimes attempted to be done, in the event of a second marriage,   
but secured her and the estate against suffering in case   
she took that step. He adopted an effectual method   
to prevent any one from seeking to marry her for the   
purpose of getting the benefit of her whole income and   
a comfortable establishment upon his property without providing for its preservation; and, if she should   
be so improvident as to marry again without having his   
conditions complied with, he took care that she should   
not thereby expose to injury or loss more than one of his estate. Ingenuity is much exercised in   
making wills, particularly in reference to the rights,   
interests, and security of wives. It is worthy of consideration, whether, all things considered, Nathaniel   
<pb n="178" id="vI178"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1223">   
<figDesc>Page 178.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Ingersoll's plan is not about as skilful and just as any   
that has been devised.</p>   
<p>We shall meet this man again in the course of our   
story. I trust to your good feeling in vindication of   
the space I have given to his biography; being strongly   
impressed with a conviction, that you will agree with   
me, &mdash; taking into view the influence he constantly   
exerted, his steadfast integrity and honor, his personal   
dignity and public spirit, &mdash; that the life of this citizen   
of a retired rural community, this plain &ldquo;husband   
man,&rdquo; is itself a monument to his memory more truly   
glorious than many which have been reared to perpetuate the names of men whom the world has called great.   
The &ldquo;training place&rdquo; has been carefully preserved.   
Occupying a central point, by the side of the principal   
street, this pretty lawn is a fitting memorial of the   
Father of the village. In its proper character, as a   
training-field, it is invested with an interest not elsewhere surpassed, if equalled. Within its enclosure   
the elements of the military art have been imparted to   
a greater number of persons distinguished in their   
day, and who have left an imperishable glory behind   
them as the defenders of the country, a brave yeomanry in arms, than on any other spot. It was   
probably used as a training field at the first settlement   
of the village. From the slaughter of Bloody Brook,   
the storming of the Narragansett Fort, and all the   
early Indian wars; from the Heights of Abraham,   
Lake George, Lexington, Bunker Hill, Brandywine,   
Pea Ridge, and a hundred other battle-fields, a lustre   
<pb n="179" id="vI179"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1224">   
<figDesc>Page 179.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
is reflected back upon this village parade-ground. It is   
associated with all the military traditions of the country, down to the late Rebellion. Lothrop, Davenport,   
Gardners, Dodges, Raymonds, Putnams, Porters,   
Hutchinsons, Herricks, Flints, and others, who here   
taught or learned the manual and drill, are names inscribed on the rolls of history for deeds of heroism   
and prowess.</p>   
<p>There was the usual diversity and variety of character among the people of the village. John Procter   
originally lived in Ipswich, where he, as well as his   
father before him, had a farm of considerable value.   
In 1666, or about that time, he removed to Salem, and   
carried on the Downing farm, which had before been   
leased to the Flints. After a while, Procter purchased   
a part-of it. If a conclusion can be drawn from the   
prevalent type of his posterity of our day, he was a   
man of herculean frame. There is, I think, a tradition   
to this effect. At any rate, his character was of that   
stamp. He had great native force and energy. He   
was bold in his spirit and in his language, &mdash; an upright   
man, no doubt, as the whole tone of the memorials of   
him indicate, but free and imprudent in speech, impulsive in feeling, and sometimes rash in action. He was   
liable from this cause, as we shall see, to get into contention and give offence. There was Jeremiah Watts,   
a representative of a class of men existing in every   
community where the intellect is stimulated and idiosyncrasies allowed to develop themselves. By occupation he was a dish-turner, but by temperament an enthusiast,   
<pb n="180" id="vI180"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1225">   
<figDesc>Page 180.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
a zealot, and an agitator. He was not satisfied   
with things as they were, nor willing to give time an   
opportunity to improve them. He took hold of the   
horns of the altar with daring hands. He denounced   
the Church and the world, &mdash; undertook to overturn   
every thing, and to put all on a new foundation. He   
entered on a crusade against what he called &ldquo;pulpit   
preaching,&rdquo; whereby particular persons, called ministers, &ldquo;may deliver what they please, and none must   
object; and this we must pay largely for; our bread   
must be taken out of our mouths, to maintain the   
beast's mark; and be wholly deprived of our Christian privileges. This is the time of Antichrist's reign,   
and he must reign this time: now are the witnesses   
slain, and the leaders in churches are these slayers.   
But I see plainly that it is a vain thing to debate about   
these things with our fellow-brethren; for they are all   
for lording it, and trampling under foot.&rdquo; This man   
imagined that he &ldquo;was singled out alone to give his   
testimony for Christ, discovering Antichrist's marks.&rdquo;   
&ldquo;If any,&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;will be faithful for Christ,   
they must witness against Antichrist, which is self, and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.   
The witnesses are now slain, but shortly they will rise   
again,&rdquo; &amp;c. He tried to get up &ldquo;private Christian   
meetings,&rdquo; to run an opposition to &ldquo;pulpit preaching.&rdquo;   
After going about from house to house, declaiming in   
this style, denouncing all who would not fall in with   
his notions and act with him, and not succeeding in   
overthrowing things in general, he hit upon a new expedient.   
<pb n="181" id="vI181"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1226">   
<figDesc>Page 181.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
As his neighbors had wit enough to let him   
alone, and did not suffer themselves to be tempted to   
resort to the civil power to make him keep quiet, he   
did it himself. He instituted proceedings against the   
ministers and churches, on the charge, that, by taking   
the rule into their own hands, they were supplanting the   
magistrates and usurping the civil power. This was   
not in itself a bad move; but the Court wisely declined   
to engage in the proceedings. They neither prosecuted   
the case nor him, but let the whole go by. They adhered severely to the do-nothing policy. What a world   
of mischief would have been avoided, if all courts,   
everywhere, at all times, had shown an equal wisdom! Watts was allowed to vex the village, torment   
the minister, and perplex those who listened to him   
by the ingenuity and ability with which he urged his   
views. He continued his brawling declamations until   
he was tired; but, not being noticed by ministers or   
magistrates, no great harm was done, and he probably   
subsided into a quiet and respectable citizen.</p>   
<p>The prominent place Giles Corey is to occupy in the   
scene before us renders an account of him particularly   
necessary. It is not easy to describe him. He was a   
very singular person. His manner of life and general   
bearing and conversation were so disregardful, in   
many particulars, of the conventional proprieties of   
his day, that it is not safe to receive implicitly the   
statements made by his contemporaries. By his peculiarities of some sort, he got a bad name. In the   
Book of Records of the First Church in Salem, where   
<pb n="182" id="vI182"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1227">   
<figDesc>Page 182.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
his public profession of religion is recorded, he is spoken   
of as a man of eighty years of age, and of a &ldquo;scandalous life,&rdquo; but who made a confession of his sins satisfactory to that body. It cannot be denied that he   
was regarded in this light by some; but there is no   
reason to believe, that, in referring to the sinfulness of   
his past life, the old man meant more than was usually   
understood by such language on such occasions. He   
was often charged with criminal acts; but in every instance the charge was proved to be either wholly unfounded or greatly exaggerated. He had a good many   
contentions and rough passages; but they were the   
natural consequences, when a bold and strong man   
was put upon the defensive, or drawn to the offensive,   
by the habit of inconsiderate aspersion into which some   
of his neighbors had been led, and the bad repute put   
upon him by scandal-mongers. He was evidently an   
industrious, hard-working man. He was a person of   
some means, a holder of considerable property in lands   
and other forms. Deeds are often found on record   
from and to him. He owned meadows near Ipswich   
River. His homestead, during the last thirty years of   
his life, was a farm of more than a hundred acres   
of very valuable land, which has been in the possession of the family, now owning it, for a hundred   
years. The present proprietor, Mr. Benjamin Taylor,   
some twenty years ago, ploughed up the site of Corey's   
dwelling-house; the vestiges of the cellar being then   
quite visible. It was near the crossing of the Salem   
and Lowell, and Georgetown and Boston Railroads,   
<pb n="183" id="vI183"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1228">   
<figDesc>Page 183.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
about three hundred feet to the west of the crossing,   
and close to the track of the former road, on its south   
side. The spot is surrounded by beautiful fields; and   
their aspect shows that it must have been, in all respects, an eligible estate. What is now known as &ldquo;the   
Curtis Field&rdquo; is a part of Corey's farm.</p>   
<p>Giles Corey lived previously, for some time, in the   
town of Salem. He sold his house there in 1659.   
The contract with a carpenter for building his farm is preserved. It was stipulated to be erected   
&ldquo;where he shall appoint.&rdquo; While the carpenter was   
getting out the materials, he selected and bought   
the farm, on which he lived ever afterwards. The   
house was to be &ldquo;twenty feet in length, fifteen   
in breadth, and eight feet stud.&rdquo; Nothing strikes   
us more, as strange and unaccountable, than the   
small size of houses in those days. One would have   
thought, that, where wood was so plenty and near at   
hand, and land of no account, they would have built   
larger houses. In a letter, dated Nov. 16, 1646, from   
Governor Winthrop to his son John, of Connecticut,   
he gives an account &ldquo;of a tempest (than which I never   
observed a greater);&rdquo; and mentions that the roof of   
&ldquo;Lady Moody's house, at Salem,&rdquo; with all of the   
chimney above it, was blown off in two parts, and   
&ldquo;carried six or eight rods. Ten persons lay under   
it, and knew not of it till they arose in the morning.&rdquo;   
The house had a flat roof, was of one story, and nine   
feet in height! Lady Deborah Moody was a person of   
high position, a connection of Sir Henry Vane, and a   
<pb n="184" id="vI184"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1229">   
<figDesc>Page 184.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
woman of property. She bought Mr. Humphreys'   
great plantation. But, like Townsend Bishop, she was   
dealt with, and compelled to quit the colony, on account of her doubts about infant baptism. Winthrop   
calls her a &ldquo;wise and anciently religious woman.&rdquo;   
She went to Long Island, where her influence was so   
important, that Governor Stuyvesant consulted her in   
his administration, and conceded to her the nomination of magistrates. It seems very strange that such   
a lady should have had a house only nine feet high.   
The early houses were built either as temporary structures or with a view to enlargement. Perhaps Lady   
Moody intended to add a story to hers. They were   
low-studded for warmth. The farm-houses generally   
were designed to be increased in length, when convenience required. The chimney was very large,   
placed at one end, and so constructed, that, on the   
extension of the building, fire-places could be opened   
into it on the new end. A building of twenty feet   
was prepared to become one of forty feet in width or   
length, as the case might be; and then the chimney   
would be in the middle of it.</p>   
<p>As has been intimated, Corey was in bad repute.   
Either he was a lawless man, or much misunderstood.   
I am inclined to the latter opinion. He belonged to   
that class of persons, instances of which we occasionally meet, who care little about the opinions or the   
talk of others. On one occasion, he was going into   
town with a cartload of wood. He met Anthony   
Needham, in company with John Procter whose house   
<pb n="185" id="vI185"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1230">   
<figDesc>Page 185.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
he had just passed. Procter accosted him thus: &ldquo;How   
now, Giles, wilt thou never leave thy old trade?   
Thou hast got some of my wood here upon thy cart.&rdquo;   
Corey answered, &ldquo;True, I did take two or three sticks   
to lay behind the cart to ease the oxen, because they   
bore too hard.&rdquo; This shows the free way in which   
Procter bantered with Corey, and the slight account   
the latter made of it. But the thing before long got   
to be too serious to be trifled with. It became the   
fashion to charge all sorts of offences against Corey;   
and, whatever any one lost or mislaid, he was considered as having abstracted it. The gossip against him   
was quite unrestrained, and created a bitter and   
angry feeling in the neighborhood. In the winter of   
1676, a man named Goodell, who had been working   
on Corey's farm, was carried home to his friends by   
Corey's wife, in a feeble state of health, and died soon   
after. It was whispered about, and before long   
openly asserted, that he had come to his death in consequence of having been violently beaten by Corey,   
who was accordingly arrested and brought to trial for   
killing the man. There was a great excitement   
against him. He probably had punished the man   
severely for some alleged misconduct; and it was   
charged that the castigation had been so unmerciful   
and excessive as to have broken down his constitution   
and caused his death. There was conflicting evidence   
going to show that the man had been beaten, for some   
misconduct, after he had returned to his family. It   
was a circumstance in favor of Corey, that his wife   
<pb n="186" id="vI186"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1231">   
<figDesc>Page 186.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
had taken the invalid to his home; and there was no   
evidence of any ill feeling between her and the sick   
man during a stop they made at Procter's house on   
their way. The death, too, it was supposed by some,   
might have resulted from ordinary disease, and not   
from whipping, either at Corey's or at home. The   
result was, that, notwithstanding the prejudice against   
Corey, he was discharged on paying a fine; showing   
that the Court did not consider it a very serious   
offence. We shall hear of this affair again.</p>   
<p>In the year 1678, there was a suit at law between   
Corey and a man named John Gloyd, a laborer on his   
farm, on a question of wages. The case was, by   
agreement of the parties, passed out of court into the   
hands of arbitrators mutually chosen. John Procter   
was one of the arbitrators, and, as it would seem,   
chosen as the friend of Gloyd: Nathaniel Putnam and   
Edmund Bridges were the others; one of them chosen   
by Corey, and the other mutually agreed upon. They   
brought in their award. Its precise character is not   
stated; but the circumstances indicate that it was   
favorable to Gloyd. The conduct of Corey on this   
occasion shows, that, though a rough man perhaps,   
and liable, from his peculiar ways, to be harshly   
spoken of, he had, after all, a generous, forgiving,   
and genial nature. Nathaniel Putnam and Edmund   
Bridges state, that, when they brought in their award,   
&ldquo;it was greatly to the satisfaction of the parties concerned; and Giles Corey did manifest as much satisfaction, and gave as many thanks to every one of us, as   
<pb n="187" id="vI187"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1232">   
<figDesc>Page 187.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
ever we heard; and Goodman Corey did manifest, to   
our observation, as much satisfaction to John Procter   
as he did to the rest of the arbitrators.&rdquo; Captain   
Moore, being by when the award was brought in, says,   
&ldquo;I did see and take notice of the abundance of love   
manifested from Corey to Procter, and from Procter to   
Corey: for they drank wine together; and Procter   
paid for part, and Corey for part.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>This remarkable overflow of affection between these   
two men is rendered interesting, not merely by the   
collisions into which, before and after, their impulsive   
and imprudent natures brought them, but by the   
part they were destined to enact in an impending   
tragedy, which was to bring them to a fearful end in   
a manner and on a scene that will arrest the notice of   
all ages, and attest to their strong characters and   
heroic spirit. The passage has a unique interest,   
and is worthy of a painter.</p>   
<p>It happened unfortunately, that, a few days after   
the loving embraces of these hardy men, Procter's   
house took fire. According to their habit, some of the   
neighbors at once started the idea, that Corey had set   
fire to it because of the award of the arbitrators, of   
whom Procter was one. Under the excitement of the   
conflagration, with his usual rashness, and forgetting   
the pledges of reconciliation that had just passed   
between them, Procter fell in with the accusation,   
and Corey was brought to trial. It appeared, in evidence, that John Phelps and Thomas Fuller, who lived   
on the western borders of the village, near Ipswich   
<pb n="188" id="vI188"/>

River, coming along the road towards Procter's Corner   
about two hours before daylight, on the way probably   
to Salem market, saw his roof on fire, gave the alarm,   
and stopped to help put it out. Thomas Gould and   
Thomas Flint thought it must be the work of an incendiary, or of &ldquo;an evil hand,&rdquo; as they expressed it, from   
the place where it took and the hour when it occurred.   
On the other hand, it was testified by James Poland   
and Caleb and Jane Moore, that they heard John   
Procter say that his boy carried a lamp and set the   
fire by accident. This was said by him, probably   
before the idea of Corey's agency in the matter had   
been put into his head. The prisoner proved an <hi rend="italics">alibi</hi>   
by the most conclusive evidence, which is so curious, as   
giving an insight of a farmer's life at that time, and   
of Corey's domestic condition, that it may well be inserted.</p>   
<p>Abraham Walcot testifies, that, &ldquo;Tuesday night   
last was a week, I lodged at Giles Corey's house,   
which night John Procter's house was damaged by   
fire; and Giles Corey went to bed before nine o'clock,   
and rose about sunrise again, and could not have gone   
out of the house but I should have heard him; and it   
must have been impossible that he should have gone   
to Procter's house that night; for he cannot in a long   
time go afoot, and, for his horse-kind, they were all   
in the woods. And further testifieth, that said Corey   
came home very weary from work, and went to bed   
the rather.&rdquo; His wife testified that he was in bed   
from nine o'clock until sunrise.</p>   
<pb n="189" id="vI189"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1234">   
<figDesc>Page 189.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>John Parker, one of Corey's four sons-in-law, testified as follows: &ldquo;I being at work with my father,   
Goodman Corey, the day Goodman Procter's house   
was on fire. I going home with my father the night   
before, he complained that he was very weary, and   
said he would go to bed. I did, on our way going,   
ask him whether or no he would eat his supper: my   
father answered me again, no, he could not eat any   
thing that night; and so went to bed, and so I   
left him abed. And, the next morning, my father   
came to me about sun-rising, and asked me to go with   
Abraham Walcot to fetch a load of hay; and my   
father said he would try whether or not he could cart   
up a load of peas. I do also testify that he had no   
horse-kind near at home at that time.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>John Gloyd, the hired man, with whom he had the   
lawsuit that had been settled a day or two before by   
arbitrators, testified, in corroboration of Parker, and   
to show that the latter could not have had any thing to   
do with the fire, that he slept in the same room with   
said Parker that night, and that he came to bed between   
nine and ten o'clock in the evening, and never rose   
until the break of day. Gloyd's wife testified to the   
same effect. There turned out to be no evidence   
against Corey whatever, but abundant proof of his   
innocence. The hard-working, &ldquo;weary&rdquo; old man was   
triumphantly acquitted. He thought, however, from   
this high-handed and utterly groundless attempt to   
wrong and ruin him, and from calumnious general   
statements that had been made against him in the   
<pb n="190" id="vI190"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1235">   
<figDesc>Page 190.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
course of the trial, that it was time to put a stop to the   
malignant and mischievous slanders which had been   
current in the neighborhood. He instituted prosecutions of Procter and others for defamation, and recovered against them all. After this, we hear no more of   
him until he experienced religion and was received   
into the First Church. Whether he and Procter   
became reconciled again is not known. Probably they   
did; for they seem to have had points of attraction,   
and each of them traits of kind-heartedness and generosity, under a rather rough exterior. The manner   
in which they bore themselves in their last hours is a   
matter of history, and stamps them both with true   
manliness.</p>   
<p>The incidents which have now been related, and the   
peculiar traits of this man, are perhaps sufficient to   
account for the fact, that he was spoken of as a person   
of &ldquo;a scandalous&rdquo; life. He had afforded food for scandal; and it is not surprising, that, in a rural community, where but few topics for talk occur beyond the   
village boundaries, all should have participated, more   
or less, in criticising his ways, and that the various   
difficulties into which he had been drawn, and the   
charges against him, should have made him the object   
of much prejudice. His wife Martha was also a   
noticeable character. She was a professor of religion,   
a member of the village church, and found her chief   
happiness in attendance upon public worship and in   
private devotions. Much of her time &mdash; indeed, all   
that she could rescue from the labors of the household   
<pb n="191" id="vI191"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1236">   
<figDesc>Page 191.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
&mdash; was spent in prayer. She was a woman of spirit   
and pluck, as we shall see.</p>   
<p>Another notability of the village was Bridget Bishop.   
In 1666 &mdash; then the widow Wasselbe &mdash; she was married to Thomas Oliver. After his death, she became   
the wife of Edward Bishop, who is spoken of as a   
&ldquo;sawyer.&rdquo; This term did not describe the same occupation them to which it is almost wholly applied now.   
Firewood, in those days, was not, as a general thing,   
sawed, but chopped. The sawyer got out boards and   
joists, beams, and timber of all kinds, from logs; and   
before mills were constructed, or where they were   
not conveniently accessible, it was an indispensable   
employment, and held a high rank among the departments of useful industry. It was in constant requisition in shipyards. It was a manly form of labor,   
requiring a considerable outlay of apparatus, and developing finely the whole muscular organization. The   
implement employed, beside the ordinary tools, such   
as wedges, beetles, the broad-axe, chains, and crowbar,   
was a strong steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with   
large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly wrought,   
some eight or ten feet in length, with a double handle,   
crossing the plate at each end at a right angle. It was   
worked by two men, and called a &ldquo;pit-saw,&rdquo; because   
sometimes the man at the lower handle stood in a deep   
pit, dug for the purpose, and called a &ldquo;saw-pit.&rdquo; But,   
among the early settlers, the usual method was to   
make a frame of strong timbers. The log to be sawed   
was raised by slings, or slid up an inclined plane, and   
<pb n="192" id="vI192"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1237">   
<figDesc>Page 192.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
placed upon cross-beams. Above it, a scaffolding   
was made on which one man stood; the other stood   
on the ground below. They each held the saw by   
both hands, and worked in unison. The log was   
pushed along by handspikes as they reached the cross, and wedges were used to keep the cleft open,   
that the saw might work free. So important was this   
business considered, that, from time to time, the General Court regulated by law the rates of pay to the   
sawyer. If a farmer had suitable woodlands, he provided in many cases a saw-frame or saw-pit of his   
own, got out his logs, and worked them into boards or   
square timber for sale. This was a profitable business.</p>   
<p>Edward Bishop had resided, for some seven years   
previous to the witchcraft delusion, within the limits   
of Salem, near the Beverly line. His wife Bridget   
was a singular character, not easily described. She   
kept a house of refreshment for travellers, and a   
shovel-board for the entertainment of her guests, and   
generally seems to have countenanced amusements   
and gayeties to an extent that exposed her to some   
scandal. She is described as wearing &ldquo;a black cap   
and a black hat, and a red paragon bodice,&rdquo; bordered   
and looped with different colors. This would appear   
to have been rather a showy costume for the times.   
Her freedom from the austerity of Puritan manners,   
and disregard of conventional decorum in her conversation and conduct, brought her into disrepute; and   
the tongue of gossip was generally loosened against   
her. She was charged with witchcraft, and actually   
<pb n="193" id="vI193"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1238">   
<figDesc>Page 193.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
brought to trial on the charge, in 1680, but was acquitted; the popular mind not being quite ripe for such   
proceedings as took place twelve years afterwards.   
She still continued to brave public sentiment, lived on   
in the same free and easy style, paying no regard to   
the scowls of the sanctimonious or the foolish tittle of the superstitious. She kept her house of   
entertainment, shovel-board, and other appurtenances.   
Sometimes, however, she resented the calumnies circulated about her being a witch, in a manner that   
made it to be felt that it was best to let her alone. A   
man called one day at the house of Samuel Shattuck,   
where there was a sick child. He was a stranger to   
the inmates of the family, and evidently had come   
to the place to make trouble for Bridget Bishop. He   
pretended great pity for the child, and said, among   
other things, in an oracular way, &ldquo;We are all born,   
some to one thing, and some to another.&rdquo; The mother   
asked him what he thought her poor, suffering child   
was born to. He replied, &ldquo;He is born to be bewitched, and is bewitched: you have a neighbor, that   
lives not far off, who is a witch.&rdquo; The good woman   
does not appear to have entertained any suspicion   
of the kind; but the man insisted on the truth of   
what he had affirmed. He succeeded in exciting   
her feelings on the subject, and, by vague insinuations and general descriptions of the witch, led her   
mind to fix upon Bridget Bishop. He said he should   
go and see her, and that he could bring her out as   
the afflicter of her child. She consented to let another   
<pb n="194" id="vI194"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1239">   
<figDesc>Page 194.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of her boys go with him, and show the way. They   
proceeded to the house, and knocked at the door.   
Bridget opened it, and asked what he would have: he   
said a pot of cider. There was something in the   
manner of the man which satisfied her that he had   
come with mischievous intent. She ordered him off,   
seized a spade that happened to be near, drove him out   
of her porch, and chased him from her premises.   
When he and the boy got back, they bore marks of   
the bad luck of the adventure. Such things had perhaps happened before, and it was found that whoever   
provoked her resentment was very likely to come off second best from the encounter; yet Bridget was a member   
of Mr. Hale's Church in Beverly, and retained her   
standing in full fellowship there. It must have been   
thought, by the pastor and members of that church,   
that no charge seriously affecting her moral or Christian character was justly imputable to her.</p>   
<p>The traveller of to-day, in passing over Crane-river   
Bridge, approaching the present village of &ldquo;The   
Plains,&rdquo; near the eastern end of the Townsend   
Bishop or Nurse farm, will notice a roadway by the   
side of the bridge descending through the brook and   
going up to rejoin the main road on the other side.   
Such turnouts are frequent by the side of bridges   
over small streams. They are refreshing and useful,   
cooling the feet and cleansing the fetlocks of horses,   
and washing the wheels of carriages. One afternoon,   
Edward Bishop, with his wife behind him on a pillion,   
was riding home from Salem. Two women, mounted in   
<pb n="195" id="vI195"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1240">   
<figDesc>Page 195.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the same way, joined them; and they chatted together   
pleasantly as their horses ambled along. When they   
came to the bridge, Bishop, probably merely for the fun   
of the thing, dashed down into the brook, instead of   
going over the bridge, to the great consternation and   
against the vehement remonstrances of his wife, who   
berated him soundly for his reckless disregard of her   
safety. They got through without accident; and the   
four jogged on together until the Bishops turned up   
to their house, and the other two kept on to their home   
in Beverly. But all the way from the bridge, until   
they parted company, Bishop was finding great fault   
with his wife, saying that he should not have been   
sorry if any mishap had occurred. She did not say   
much after her first fright and resentment were over;   
but he kept on talking very freely about her, and using   
some pretty hard language. This affair, which perhaps is not without a parallel in the occasional experiences of married life, was, with other things of an   
equally trivial and irrelevant character, brought to   
bear fatally against her at her trial on the charge of   
witchcraft, between seven and eight years afterward.</p>   
<p>I can find no evidence against the moral character   
of this woman. One person, at least, who participated   
largely in getting up accusations against her, acknowledged, in a death-bed repentance, the wrong she had   
done. Mr. Hale, the minister of the Beverly congregation, states, in a deposition, that a certain woman,   
&ldquo;being in full communion in our church, came to me   
to desire that Goodwife Bishop, her neighbor, wife of   
<pb n="196" id="vI196"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1241">   
<figDesc>Page 196.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Edward Bishop, Jr., might not be permitted to receive   
the Lord's Supper in our church till she had given her   
satisfaction for some offences that were against her;   
namely, because the said Bishop did entertain people   
in her house at unseasonable hours in the night, to   
keep drinking and playing at shovel-board, whereby   
discord did arise in other families, and young people   
were in danger to be corrupted; that she knew these   
things, and had once gone into the house, and,   
finding some at shovel-board, had taken the pieces   
they played with and thrown them into the fire, and   
had reproved the said Bishop for promoting such disorders, but received no satisfaction from her about   
it.&rdquo; According to Mr. Hale's statement, the night   
after this complaint was brought to him, the woman   
was found to be distracted. &ldquo;She continuing some   
time distracted, we sought the Lord by fasting and   
prayer.&rdquo; After a while, the woman recovered her   
senses, and, as Mr. Hale says he understood, expressed   
a suspicion &ldquo;that she had been bewitched by Bishop's   
wife.&rdquo; He declares that he did not, at the time, countenance the idea, &ldquo;hoping better of Goody Bishop.&rdquo;   
He says further, that he &ldquo;inquired of Margaret   
King, who kept at or near the house,&rdquo; what she had   
observed concerning the woman who had been distracted. &ldquo;She told me that she was much given to   
reading and searching the prophecies of Scripture.&rdquo;   
At length the woman appeared to have entirely recovered, went to Goody Bishop, gave satisfaction for what   
she had said and done against her, and they became   
<pb n="197" id="vI197"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1242">   
<figDesc>Page 197.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
friends again. Mr. Hale goes on to say, &ldquo;I was oft   
praying with and counselling of her before her death.&rdquo;   
She earnestly desired that &ldquo;Edward Bishop might be   
sent for, that she might make friends with him. I   
asked her if she had wronged Edward Bishop. She   
said, not that she knew of, unless it were in taking his   
shovel-board pieces, when people were at play with   
them, and throwing them into the fire; and, if she did   
evil in it, she was very sorry for it, and desired he   
would be friends with her, or forgive her. This was   
the very day before she died.&rdquo; That night her distemper returned, and, in a paroxysm of insanity, she   
destroyed herself.</p>   
<p>It is evident, from his own account, that Mr. Hale   
did not then fall in with, or countenance at all, any   
unfavorable impressions against Bridget Bishop; and   
that the poor diseased woman, when entirely free from   
her malady, repented bitterly of what she had done   
and said of Goodman Bishop and his wife, and heartily desired their forgiveness. So far as the facts   
stated by Mr. Hale of his own knowledge go, they   
prove that Bridget Bishop was the victim of gross   
misrepresentation. Five years afterwards, as we shall   
see, Mr. Hale gave a very different version of the   
affair, and one which it is extremely difficult to reconcile with his own former deliberate convictions at the   
time when the circumstances occurred.</p>   
<p>As it is my object to bring before you every thing   
that may help to explain the particular occurrences   
embraced in the account I am to give of the witchcraft   
<pb n="198" id="vI198"/>

<figDesc>Page 198.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
prosecutions, two other persons must be mentioned   
before concluding this branch of my subject, &mdash; George   
Jacobs, Sr., and his son George Jacobs, Jr. They   
each had given offence to some persons, and suffered   
that sort of notoriety which led to the selection of   
victims, although both were persons of respectability. The father owned and had lived for about a   
half-century on a farm in North Fields, on the banks   
of Endicott River, a little to the eastward of the   
bridge at the iron-foundery. He was a person of good   
estate and an estimable man; but it was his misfortune to have an impulsive nature and quick passions.   
In June, 1677, he was prosecuted and fined for   
striking a man who had incensed him. George   
Jacobs, Jr., his only son, at a court held Nov. 7, 1674,   
was prosecuted, &ldquo;found blamable, and ordered to   
pay costs of court.&rdquo; His offence and defence are   
embraced in his deposition on the occasion.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">George Jacobs's Answer to Nathaniel Putnam's   
Complaint.</hi> &mdash; That I did follow some horses in our enclosure on the Royal Side, where they were trespassing upon us;   
that the end of my following them was to take them; but,   
rather than they would be taken, they took the water, and I   
did follow them no further; but straightway they turned   
ashore, and I did run to take them as they came out of the   
water, but could not: and I can truly take my oath that   
since that time I did never follow any horses or mares; and   
I hope my own oath will clear me.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The result of his attempt to drive off the horses   
was, that several valuable animals were drowned.   
<pb n="199" id="vI199"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1244">   
<figDesc>Page 199.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Their owner, Nathaniel Putnam, brought an action;   
but he could not recover damages. The horses were   
evidently trespassing, and the Court did not seem to   
regard Jacobs's conduct as a heinous matter. It is   
not to be supposed, that Nathaniel Putnam harbored   
sentiments of revenge or resentment for eighteen   
years, or had any hand in prosecuting Jacobs in   
1692. There is every indication that he did not   
sympathize in the violent passions which raged on that   
occasion, although he was much under the power of   
the delusion. But the affair of drowning the horses   
was probably for a long time a topic of gossip, and   
may have given to the author of the catastrophe a   
notoriety which nearly cost him his life.</p>   
<p>The account that has been given of the elements of   
the population of the Salem Farms or Village, shows   
that, while there were the usual varieties entering   
into the composition of all communities, it is wholly   
inadmissible to suppose that the witchcraft delusion   
took place there because it was the scene of greater   
ignorance or stupidity or barbarism than prevailed   
elsewhere. This will be made more apparent still by   
some general views of the state of society and manners. The people of a remote age are in general only   
regarded as they are seen through prominent occurrences and public movements. These constitute the   
ordinary materials of history. Dynasties, reigns of   
kings, armies, legislative proceedings, large ecclesiastical synods, dogmatic creeds, and the like, are, as a   
general thing, about all we know of the past. Portraits

of individuals appear here and there; but, separated from the ordinary life of the times, they cannot   
be fairly or fully appreciated. The public life of the   
past is but the outline, or, more strictly speaking, the   
mere skeleton, of humanity. To fill up the outline, to   
clothe the skeleton with elastic nerves and warm flesh,   
and quicken it with a vital circulation, we must get at   
the domestic, social, familiar, and ordinary experience   
of individuals and private persons; we must obtain a   
view of the popular customs and the daily routine of   
life. In this way only can history fulfil its office in   
making the past present.</p>   
<p>The people of the early colonial settlements had a   
private and interior life, as much as we have now, and  
the people of all ages and countries have had. It is   
common to regard them in no other light than as a   
severe, sombre, and pleasure-abhorring generation. It   
was not so with them altogether. They had the   
same nature that we have. It was not all gloom   
and severity. They had their recreations, amusements, gayeties, and frolics. Youth was as buoyant   
with hope and gladness, love as warm and tender,   
mirth as natural to innocence, wit as sprightly, then   
as now. There was as much poetry and romance: the   
merry laugh enlivened the newly opened fields, and   
range through the bordering woods as loud, jocund,   
and unrestrained as in these older and more crowded   
settlements. It is true that their theology was austere, and their polity, in Church and State, stern; but,   
in their modes of life, there were some features which   
<pb n="201" id="vI201"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1246">   
<figDesc>Page 201.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
gave peculiar opportunity to exercise and gratify a   
love of social excitement of a pleasurable kind. Let   
me mention some of the customs having a tendency   
in this direction, that prevailed in the early settlements of New England.</p>   
<p>Whenever a young man had made his clearing in   
the forest, got out the frame of his house, and selected a helpmeet to dwell with him in it, there was   
&ldquo;a raising.&rdquo; On an appointed day, the neighbors   
far and near assembled; all together put their shoulders to the work; and, before the shadows of night   
enveloped the scene, the house was up, and covered   
from sill to ridgepole. The same was done if the   
house of a neighbor had been destroyed by fire. In   
this case, often the timbers, joists, and boards were   
contributed as well as the labor. These were made   
the occasions of general merriment, in which all ages   
and both sexes participated. Then there were the   
&ldquo;huskings.&rdquo; After the barns were filled with hay   
and grain, and the corn was ripe, at &ldquo;harvest home,&rdquo;   
gatherings would be seen on the bright autumnal   
afternoons of successive days, in the neighborhood of   
the different farmhouses. The sheaves would be taken   
from the shocks and brought up from the fields, the   
golden leaves and milky tassels stripped from the   
full ear, and the crib filled to the brim. These   
were scenes of unalloyed enjoyment and unrestrained   
gayety.</p>   
<p>At that time were prevalent, in rural neighborhoods,   
other recreations promotive of social hilarity to the   
<pb n="202" id="vI202"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1247">   
<figDesc>Page 202.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
highest degree. As a wintry evening drew on, the   
wide, deep fireplace &mdash; equalling in width nearly the   
whole of one side of the room, and so deep that   
benches were permanently attached to the jambs, on   
which two or more could comfortably sit &mdash; was duly   
prepared. A huge log, of a diameter equal to that   
of &ldquo;the mast of some great admiral,&rdquo; six feet perhaps in length, was worked in by handspikes to its   
place as the &ldquo;back-log;&rdquo; a smaller one, as &ldquo;backstick,&rdquo; placed over it; the great andirons duly adjusted, and the wood piled on artistically &mdash; for there   
was an art in building a wood-fire. The kindlings   
were placed on top of the whole; never by an experienced hand below. More than the light of day,   
from dazzling chandeliers or the magic tongues of   
flaming gas-burners, blazes through the halls of modern luxury and splendor; but the lights and shadows   
from a glowing, old-fashioned, New-England country   
fireplace created a scene as enlivening, exhilarating,   
and genial as has ever been witnessed, and cannot be surpassed. Assembled neighbors in a single   
evening accomplished what would have been the work   
of a family for months. The corn and the nuts were   
all shelled; the young birch was stripped down in   
thin strands, and brooms enough made for a year's   
service in house and barn; and various other useful   
offices rendered. The sound of busy hands and nimble fingers was lost in commingling happy voices.   
<unclear></unclear> and jest, joy and love, ruled the hour. The whole   
affair was followed by &ldquo;Blind-man's Buff&rdquo; or some   
<pb n="203" id="vI203"/>

<figDesc>Page 203.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
other sport. After the &ldquo;old folks&rdquo; had considerately   
retired, who knows but that the sons and daughters of   
Puritans sometimes wound up with a dance? There   
were sleigh-rides, and the woods rang with the happy   
laugh and jingling bells. The vehicles used on these   
occasions were, prior to 1700, more properly called   
&ldquo;sleds.&rdquo; Our modern &ldquo;sleigh&rdquo; had not then been   
introduced. As the spring came on, logs would be   
hollowed or scooped out and placed near the feet of   
sugar maples, a slanting incision made a foot or two   
above them in the trunks of the trees, a slip of shingle inserted, and the delicious sap would trickle down   
into the troughs. When the proper time came, tents   
or booths made of evergreen boughs would be erected   
in the woods, great kettles hung over blazing fires,   
and a whole neighborhood camp out for several days   
and nights, until the work was accomplished, and the   
flavory syrup or solid cakes of sugar brought out.</p>   
<p>These were some of the recreations of the country   
people in the early settlements of New England; continuing, perhaps, in frontier towns to this day. They   
constituted forms of enjoyment which cannot exist in   
cities or older communities; and possessed a charm,   
in the memory of all who ever participated in them,   
greater, far greater, than society in any later stage can   
possess.</p>   
<p>The principal method of travelling in those days   
was on horseback. It afforded many special opportunities for social enjoyment. Women as well as <unclear></unclear>   
were trained to it. The people of the village were all

at home in the saddle. The daughters of Joseph Putnam, sisters of Israel, were celebrated as equestrians.   
Tradition relates adventurous feats of theirs in this   
line, equal to that which constitutes a part of the history of their famous brother. There were, perhaps,   
several games of skill or chance practised more or less,   
even in those days, in this neighborhood. The only   
one that seems to have been openly allowed, of which   
we have any evidence, was shovel-board. This game,   
now supposed to be out of use, is referred to by Shakespeare, and was quite common in England as well as in   
this country. A board about two and a half feet wide   
and twenty feet long was placed three feet above the   
floor, somewhat like a billiard-table, though not with   
so wide a surface, precisely level and perfectly smooth,   
covered with a sprinkling of fine sand. It was provided with weights or balls, called &ldquo;pieces,&rdquo; flattened   
on one end. The game consisted in shoving them   
as far as possible, without going over the end. A   
trough surrounded the table to catch the pieces if they   
fell. Richard Grant White, from whom this account   
of the game has been derived, says that &ldquo;it required   
great accuracy of eye, and steadiness of hand, much   
more than ten-pins.&rdquo; He states that, when a boy, he   
saw it played by &ldquo;brawny&rdquo; men, in Brooklyn, N.Y.,   
and that the pieces then used were of brass. It is   
probable that the &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; used on Bridget Bishop's   
shovel-board were made of some heavy wood, as they   
were thrown into the fire for the purpose of destroying   
them. The fact that a game like this was suffered to

be openly played in Salem Village is quite remarkable,   
and shows that some license was left for such amusements.</p>   
<p>The records and files of the local courts show, that,   
notwithstanding the austere gravity and strictness of   
manners and morals usually ascribed to our New ancestors, occasional irregularities occurred in the   
early settlements, which would be considered high misdemeanors in our day. The following deposition was   
given &ldquo;on oath before the Court,&rdquo; Feb. 26, 1651. Edward Norris was the son of the minister of the First   
Church; had been for more than ten years, and continued to be for twenty years after, schoolmaster of   
the town; and, by his character as well as office, commanded the highest respect. John Kitchen, in 1655,   
was chosen &ldquo;searcher and sealer of leather.&rdquo; Giles   
Corey had not yet purchased his farm, but lived on his   
town-lot, extending from Essex Street, near its western extremity, to the North River. They were severally persons of good estate.</p>

Norris his heels and mine, and fell upon me, and catched   
me by the throat, and held me so long till he had almost   
stopped my breath. And I said unto John Kitchen, `This   
is not good jesting.' And John Kitchen replied, `This is   
nothing: I do owe you more than this of old: this is not   
half of that which you shall have afterwards.' After this,

and I went my ways. And John Kitchen followed me half up the lane, or thereabouts. Perceiving him to follow   
me, I went to go over the rails. He took me again, and   
threw me down off the rails, and fell a beating of me until   
I was all bloody. And, Thomas Bishop being present, I   
desired him to bear witness of what he saw. Upon my   
words, he let me rise. As soon as I was up, he fell a beating of me again.</p></q>

<p>This was indeed an extraordinary outburst of lawless violence, and gives a singular insight of the state   
of society. Such an occurrence in our day would create astonishment. The organized power of the community to suppress vicious and rude passions was   
probably never brought to bear with greater rigidness   
than in our Puritan villages; but it did not fully accomplish its end. Behind and beneath the solemn and   
formal exterior, there was, after all, perhaps as much   
irregularity of life as now. The nature of man had   
not been subdued. The people had their quarrels and   
fights, and their frolics and merriments, in defiance of   
the restraints of authority. Violations of local and   
general laws were not infrequent; and flowed, as ever   
since, from intemperance, in as large a measure. Kitchen, in this instance, acted as if under the influence of   
liquor. His behavior, in tripping up the heels and   
throwing dirty water upon the person of the schoolmaster   
<pb n="207" id="vI207"/>

<figDesc>Page 207.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of the town, the dignity of whose social position is indicated by the title of &ldquo;Mr.;&rdquo; and in giving   
to Corey such a persistent and gratuitous pommelling,   
&mdash; bears the aspect of a drunken delirium. The latter   
seems not to have supposed, for some time, that he was   
in earnest, but to have looked upon his conduct as   
rough play, which was carried rather too far. Poor   
Corey was often getting before the town Court as accused or accuser. He was, to the end, the victim of   
ill-usage, either given or taken. Though not a bad man, he was almost always in trouble. The   
tenor of his long life was as eccentric and unruly as   
the manner of his death was strange and horrible.</p>   
<p>There was what may be called an institution in the   
rural parishes of the early times, still existing to some   
extent perhaps in country places, which must not be   
omitted in an enumeration of controlling influences.   
The people lived on farms, at some distance from each   
other, and almost all at great distances from the meeting. Local and parental authority, church discipline, public opinion, enforced attendance upon the   
regular religious services. Fashion, habit, and choice   
concurred in bringing all to meeting on the Lord's   
Day. It was impossible for many to return home   
during the intermission between the services of the   
forenoon and afternoon. The effect was, that the whole   
community were thrown and kept together every week   
for several hours, during which they could not avoid   
social intercourse. It was a more effective institution   
than the town-meeting; for it occurred oftener, and   
<pb n="208" id="vI208"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1253">   
<figDesc>Page 208.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
included women and children. In pleasant weather,   
they would perhaps gather together in knots at eligible   
places, or stroll off in companies to the shades of the   
neighboring woods. In bad weather, they would remain in the meeting-house, or congregate at Deacon   
Ingersoll's ordinary, or in the great rooms of his dwelling. As a whole, this practice must have produced important results upon the character of the   
people. In the absence of newspapers, or of much   
intercourse with remote places, the day was made the   
occasion for hearing and telling all the news. It provided for the circulation of ideas, good and bad. It   
widened the sphere of influence of the wiser and better   
sort, and gave opportunity for mischievous people to   
do much harm. It was a sort of central bazaar, open   
every week, where all the varieties of local gossip could   
be interchanged and circulated far and wide. Of the   
aggregate character of the effects thus produced, I do   
not propose to strike the balance. It was undoubtedly   
an effective instrumentality in moulding the population   
of the country, developing the elements of society,   
quickening and rendering more vigorous the action of   
the people in masses, and elucidating the phenomena   
of their history. It answers my purpose, at present,   
to suggest, that, if any popular delusion or fanaticism   
arose, the means of giving it a rapid diffusion, and of   
intensifying its power, were in this way provided.</p>   
<p>In the early settlement of the country, the pursuit   
of game in the forests, rivers, and lakes, was necessary   
as a means of subsistence, and has always been important   
<pb n="209" id="vI209"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1254">   
<figDesc>Page 209.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in that view. A war against beasts and birds   
of prey was also required to be incessantly kept up.   
The methods adopted for these ends were various and   
ingenious, often requiring courage and skill, and in   
most instances conducted in companies. Deer and   
moose were sometimes caged by surrounding them, or   
trapped; but the gun was chiefly relied upon in their   
pursuit. There were various methods for catching the   
smaller animals. One of the sports of boyhood was to   
spring the rabbits or hares. A sapling, or young tree,   
was bent down and fastened to a stick slid into notches   
cut in trees, on each side of the path of the animal.   
The rabbit is wont to race through the woods at great   
speed, and along established tracks, which, particularly   
after snow has fallen, are clearly traceable. To the   
cross-stick, thus placed above the path, one end of a   
strong horse-hair was tied. The other end was in   
a slip-knot, with a noose just large enough, and hanging at the height, to receive the head of the rabbit.   
Not seeing the noose, and rushing along the path, the   
rabbit would jerk the cross-stick out of the notches.   
The tree would bound back to its original upright direction, and the rabbit remain swinging aloft, until, at   
the break of day, the boys would rejoice in the success   
of their stratagem. Pigeons in clouds frequented the   
country in their seasons, and acres upon acres of the   
forests bowed beneath their weight. They were taken   
by nets, dozens at a time, or brought down in great   
numbers by shot-guns. The marshalled hosts of wild   
geese made their noisy flights over the land in the   
<pb n="210" id="vI210"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1255">   
<figDesc>Page 210.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
spring and fall, traversing a space spanning the continent north and south. They were brought down by   
the gun, on the wing, or surprised while resting in   
their long route or stopped by storms, around secluded   
ponds or swamps. Ducks and other aquatic birds were   
abundant on the rivers and marshes, and pursued in   
canoes along the bays and seashores. Salt-water fish   
were within reach in the neighboring ocean; while an   
unfailing supply of fresh-water fish was yielded by Wenham Lake, Wilkins's Pond, and the running streams.</p>   
<p>The bear was a formidable prowler around the settlements, killing young cattle, making havoc in the   
sheepfold, and depredating upon the barn and farm   
yard. He was a dangerous antagonist, of immense   
strength in his arms and claws. Sometimes he was   
reached effectually by the gun, but the trap was mainly   
relied upon to secure him. His skin made him a valuble prize, and he supplied other beneficial uses. The   
earliest and rudest method of trapping a bear was as   
follows: A place was selected in the woods, where two   
large fallen and mouldering trees were side by side   
within two or three feet of each other. The space   
between them would be roofed over by throwing   
branches and boughs across them, and closed up at   
one end. The other end would be left open. A gun   
was placed inside, heavily loaded, the muzzle towards   
the open end; to the trigger a cord was fastened running along by the barrel of the gun, passing over a   
cross-bar, and hanging down directly before the muzzle, baited with a piece of fresh meat. The bear,   
<pb n="211" id="vI211"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1256">   
<figDesc>Page 211.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
ranging in the woods at night, would be attracted by   
the smell of meat, and come snuffing around. At the   
open end, he would see the bait, rush in, seize it   
between his jaws, pull the cord, discharge the gun,   
and his head and breast be torn to pieces. The men   
engaged in the enterprise would remain awake in some   
neighboring house, waiting and listening, with the extremest interest, for the report of the gun to announce   
their success. At the break of day, they would gather   
to the spot, and participate in the profit of the capture.   
After a while, iron or steel traps were introduced.   
They would be skilfully baited and set, and fastened to   
a tree by a chain. The whole was covered over with   
light soil and leaves. The bear would make for the   
bait. The weight of his paw would spring the trap.   
The iron-teeth would hold him fast till the morning.   
In his suffering and exasperation, it would require   
considerable effort to despatch him. In catching bears,   
as well as foxes, much skill and art were needed.   
They were each very wary and cautious; and, where   
iron was used in the traps, some scent was necessary   
to disguise the smell of the metal. All appearance of   
having been disturbed had to be removed from the   
ground. Trapping became quite a science, and was a   
pursuit of much importance.</p>   
<p>Wolves were perhaps the most destructive of the   
beasts of prey. Although not so large or strong as   
bears, they were far more fierce and rapacious. Bears   
could be tamed, but wolves not. Bears were not dangerous, unless provoked, or suffering from hunger, or   
<pb n="212" id="vI212"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1257">   
<figDesc>Page 212.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
alarmed for the safety of their young. It was thought   
that kind treatment would awaken strong attachment   
in them, but wolves were always snarling and ferocious.   
They roamed mostly in packs, and would kill sheep,   
lambs, and poultry long after hunger was appeased.   
The farmers regarded them as their great enemy. A   
long and deep trench would be dug, lined with slippery logs, from which the bark had been taken, standing upright, and touching each other. The trench was   
covered by a slight framework, upon which leaves and   
dirt were scattered, to make the surface appear like   
the surrounding territory. Some savory bait would be   
placed over it. The wolves, rushing on, would break   
through. Not being able to ascend the sides, they   
would be found alive, the next morning, at the bottom.   
These were called &ldquo;wolf-pits.&rdquo; It was no easy matter   
to dispose of or despatch the furious animals, and the   
wolf-pits were often the scenes of much excitement.   
There was another class of animals, &mdash; divided into different species, mostly according to their size, &mdash; smaller   
but fiercer than wolves, of extraordinary strength and   
activity, called wild-cats, catamounts, or loup-cerviers,   
pronounced by the farmers lucifees. These were only   
taken by the gun. It was considered a useful public   
service, and no inconsiderable feat, to kill them.</p>   
<p>Some of the laborious employments, at that time,   
were especially promotive of social influence; for instance, the making and mending highways. This was   
secured by a tax, annually levied in town-meeting.   
The work was placed under the care and direction of   
<pb n="213" id="vI213"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1258">   
<figDesc>Page 213.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
surveyors, annually chosen. A small part of this tax,   
however, was paid in money. Most of it was &ldquo;worked   
out.&rdquo; At convenient seasons, when there was a respite   
from the ordinary farm work, the men of a neighborhood would come together, in greater or less numbers,   
at a designated time and place, with their oxen and   
implements. Working in unison, they would work   
merrily and with energy; and, as the tough roots and   
deeply bedded rocks gave way to the pickaxe, crowbar,   
and chain, and rough places became smooth, the wilderness would echo back their voices of gratulation,   
and a spirit of animating rivalry stimulate their toils.   
Many other operations were carried on, such as getting up hay from the salt-marshes and building stone, by neighbors working in companies.</p>   
<p>Particular circumstances in the history of the population of Salem Village contributed to keep up a condition of general intelligence, which served, to some   
degree, as a substitute for an organized system of   
education. Indeed, any thing like regular schools   
was rendered impossible by the then-existing circumstances. Clearings had made a very inconsiderable encroachment on the wilderness. There were here and   
there farmhouses, with deep forests between. It was   
long before easily traversable roads could be made.   
A schoolhouse placed permanently on any particular   
spot would be within the reach of but very few.   
Farmers most competent to the work, who had enjoyed the advantages of some degree of education,   
and could manage to set apart any time for the purpose,   
<pb n="214" id="vI214"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1259">   
<figDesc>Page 214.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
were, in some instances, prevailed upon to receive such children as were within reaching distance   
as pupils in their own houses, to be instructed by them   
at stated times and for a limited period. Daniel   
Andrew rendered this service occasionally. At one   
period, we find them practising the plan of a movable   
school and schoolmaster. He would be stationed in   
the houses of particular persons, with whom the arrangement could be made, a month at a time, in the   
different quarters of the village, from Will's Hill to Bass   
River. Of course, there was a great lack of elementary education. For a considerable time, it was reduced   
to a very low point; and there were heads of families, &mdash;   
men who had good farms, and possessed the confidence   
and respect of their neighbors, &mdash; who appear not to   
have been able to write.</p>   
<p>It is difficult, however, to come to a definite estimate   
on this subject, as the singular fact is discovered,   
that some persons, who could write, occasionally preferred to &ldquo;make their mark.&rdquo; Ann Putnam, in executing her will, made her mark; but her confession,   
with her own proper written signature, is spread out in   
the Church-book. Francis Nurse very frequently used   
his peculiar mark, representing, perhaps, some implement of his original mechanical trade; but, on other   
occasions, he wrote out his name in a good, round   
hand. The same was the case with Bray Wilkins.   
We can hardly reach any decisive conclusions as to the   
intelligence or education of the people of that day from   
their handwriting, or construction of sentences, much   
<pb n="215" id="vI215"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1260">   
<figDesc>Page 215.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
less from their spelling. Their forms of speech were   
very different from ours in many respects. What, at   
first view, we might be apt to call errors of ignorance,   
were perhaps conformity to good usage at the time.   
Their use of verbs is different from ours, particularly   
in the subjunctive mood, and in conjugation generally.   
They did not follow our rule in reference to number.   
When the nominative was a plural noun, or several   
nouns, they often employ the connected verb in the   
singular number, and <hi rend="italics">vice vers&acirc;.</hi> They were inclined   
to make construction conform to the sense, rather than   
to the letter. It is not certain that their usage, in this   
particular, is wholly indefensible. Cicero, in his fifth   
oration against Verres, couples <hi rend="italics">rem</hi> with <hi rend="italics">futurum.</hi>   
This was looked upon by some editors as an error,   
and they altered the text accordingly; but Aulus   
Gelius, in his &ldquo;Attic Nights,&rdquo; maintains that it is   
the true reading, and, in view of the sense of the passage, a legitimate and elegant use of language. He   
cites instances, in Latin and Greek authors of the highest standard, of a similar usage.</p>   
<p>Nothing, or scarcely any thing, can be inferred from   
spelling. It was wholly unsettled among the best men, and in the practice of the same person.   
In Winthrop's &ldquo;Journal,&rdquo; he spells the name of his   
distinguished friend &mdash; the governor of both Massachusetts and Connecticut &mdash; sometimes Haynes, and   
sometimes Haines. The <hi rend="italics">r</hi> is generally dropped from   
his own signature, or, if not intentionally dropped, is   
quite lost in one or the other of the contiguous letters.   
<pb n="216" id="vI216"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1261">   
<figDesc>Page 216.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
It is a curious circumstance, that the name   
&ldquo;Winthrop&rdquo; is spelled differently by our governor, his   
wife, and his son, the governor of Connecticut; each   
varying from either of the other two. George Burroughs, a graduate of Harvard College, wrote his own   
name sometimes with, and sometimes without, the <hi rend="italics">s.</hi>   
In our General-court records, the name of the first   
Captain Davenport is spelled in at least four different   
ways. The Putnams sometimes wrote their name   
Putman. The name of the Nurses was often written   
Nourse, and sometimes Nurs.</p>   
<p>Unable to come to any reliable conclusions in   
reference to the general intelligence of the people of   
Salem Village from their orthography, etymology, syntax, or chirography, compared with their contemporaries, I can only say, that, in examining the records and   
papers which have come down to us, the wonder to me   
is that they expressed themselves so well. I do not   
hesitate to say, that, in the various controversies in   
which they were involved, prior to and immediately   
after the witchcraft delusion, there is a pervading appearance of uncommon appreciation of the questions at   
issue, and substantial evidence that there was a solid   
substratum of good sense among them.</p>   
<p>Their manners appear to have been remarkably courteous and respectful, showing the effect still remaining   
upon their style of intercourse and personal bearing,   
of the society and example of the great number of   
eminent, enlightened, and accomplished men and families that had resided or mingled with them during all   
<pb n="217" id="vI217"/>

<figDesc>Page 217.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the early period of their history. In their deportment   
to each other, there was that sort of decorum which   
indicates good breeding. They paid honor to gray   
hairs, and assigned to age the first rank in seating the   
congregation, a matter to which, before the introduction of pews as a particular property, they gave the   
greatest consideration. The &ldquo;seating&rdquo; was to continue for a year; and a committee of persons who   
would command the greatest confidence was regularly   
appointed to report on the delicate and difficult subject. Their report, signed by them severally, was entered in full in the parish record-book. The invariable   
rule was, first, age; then, office; last, rates. The chief   
seats were given to old men and women of respectable characters, without regard to their circumstances   
in life or position in society. Then came the families   
of the minister and deacons, the parish committee and   
clerk, the constable of the village, magistrates, and   
military officers. These were preferred, because all   
offices were then honorable, and held, if they were   
called to them, by the principal people. Last came   
rates, &mdash; that is, property. The richest man in the   
parish, if not holding office, or old enough to be   
counted among the aged, would take his place with   
the residue of the congregation. The manner in   
which parents were spoken of on all occasions is quite   
observable, not only in written documents, but ordinary conversation, &mdash; always with tender respectfulness.   
In almost all cases, the expressions used are &ldquo;my honored father&rdquo; or &ldquo;my honored mother,&rdquo; and this by persons

in the humblest and most inferior positions in life.   
The terms &ldquo;Goodman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Goodwife&rdquo; were applied   
to the heads of families. The latter word was abbreviated to &ldquo;Goody,&rdquo; but not at all, as our dictionaries   
have it, as a &ldquo;low term of civility.&rdquo; It was applied to the most honored matrons, such as the wife   
of Deacon Ingersoll. It was a term of respect; conveying, perhaps, an affectionate sentiment, but not in   
the slightest degree disrespectful, derogatory, or belittling. Surely no better terms were ever used to characterize a worthy person. &ldquo;Goodman&rdquo; comprehends   
all that can be ascribed to a citizen of mature years in   
the way of commendation; and the whole catalogue of   
pretentious titles ever given by flatterers or courtiers to   
a married lady cannot, all combined, convey a higher   
encomium than the term &ldquo;Goodwife.&rdquo; How much   
more expressive, courteous to the persons to whom   
they are applied, and consistent with the self-respect of   
the person using them, than &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo;! A   
more than questionable taste and a foolish pride have   
led us to adopt these terms because they were originally applicable to the gentry or to magistrates, and to   
abandon the good old words which had a meaning   
truly polite to others, and not degrading to ourselves!</p>   
<p>A patriarchal authority and dignity was recognized   
in families. The oldest member was often called, by   
way of distinction, &ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; merely on account of   
his seniority, without reference particularly to the   
extent of his domain or the value of his acres. After   
<pb n="219" id="vI219"/>

the death of Thomas Putnam, in 1686, his brother   
Nathaniel had the title; after him, the surviving   
brother, Captain John; after him, it fell to the next   
generation, and Benjamin, a son of Nathaniel, became &ldquo;Landlord Putnam.&rdquo; It was so with other   
families.</p>   
<p>The liberal and judicious policy, before described,   
of giving estates to children on their marriage, with   
the maintenance of parental authority in the household, produced the desired effect upon the character   
of the people. It was almost a matter of course, that,   
on reaching mature years, young men and women   
would own the covenant, and become members of the   
church. The general tone of society was undoubtedly   
favorable to the moral and religious welfare of the   
younger portion of the community. Some exceptions   
occurred, but few in number. One case, however, in   
which there was a flagrant violation of filial duty, may   
not be omitted in this connection; for it belongs to   
the public history of the country.</p>

<p>John Porter, Jr., the eldest son of the founder of   
that most respectable family, about thirty years of   
age, appears to have been a very wicked and incorrigible person. His abusive treatment of his parents   
reached a point where it became necessary, in the last   
resort, to appeal to the protection of the law. After   
various proceedings, he was finally sentenced to stand   
on the ladder of the gallows with a rope around his   
neck for an hour; to be severely whipped; committed   
to the House of Correction; kept closely at work on

prison diet, not to be released until so ordered by the   
Court of Assistants or the General Court; and to pay   
&ldquo;a fine to the country of two hundred pounds.&rdquo; It   
is stated, that, if the mother of the culprit &ldquo;had not   
been overmoved by her tender affections to forbear   
appearing against him, the Court must necessarily   
have proceeded with him as a capital offender, according to our law being grounded upon and expressed in   
the Word of God, in Deut. xxi. 18 to 21. See Capital   
Laws, p. 9, &sect; 14.&rdquo; Some time afterward, the General Court, upon his petition, granted him a release   
from imprisonment, on condition of his immediate departure from this jurisdiction; first giving a bond of   
two hundred pounds not to return without leave   
of the General Court or Court of Assistants.</p>   
<p>In 1664, four commissioners, Colonel Richard Nichols, Sir Robert Carr, George Cartwright, and Samuel   
Maverick, Esqs., were sent over by Charles II. &ldquo;to   
hear and determine complaints and appeals in all   
causes, as well military as criminal and civil.&rdquo; There   
had always been a powerful influence at work in the   
English Court adverse to New England. It had been   
thus far successfully baffled by the admirable diplomacy of the colonial government and agents. All   
conflicts of authority had been prevented from coming   
to a head by a skilful policy of &ldquo;protracting and avoiding.&rdquo; But the restoration of the Stuarts boded no   
good to the liberties of the colonies; and the arrival   
of these commissioners with their sweeping authority   
was regarded as designed to deal the long-deferred   
<pb n="221" id="vI221"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1266">   
<figDesc>Page 221.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
fatal blow at chartered rights. They began with a   
high hand. The General Court did not quail before   
them, but stood ready to take advantage of the first   
false step of the commissioners; and they did not have   
long to wait.</p>   
<p>Porter had taken refuge in Rhode Island. When   
the commissioners visited that colony, he appealed to   
them for redress against the Massachusetts General   
Court. They were inconsiderate enough to espouse   
his cause, and issued a proclamation giving him protection to return to Boston to have his case tried   
before them. The General Court at once took issue   
with them, and changed their attitude from the defensive to the offensive; denounced their proceedings;   
spread upon the official records a full account, in the   
plainest language, of Porter's outrages upon his parents, exhibiting it in details that could not but shock   
every sentiment of humanity and decency; holding   
up the commissioners as the abettors and protectors of   
criminality of the deepest dye; and planting themselves fair and square against them on the merits of   
Porter's case. The commissioners tried to explain   
and extricate themselves; but they could not escape   
from the toils in which, through rashness, they had become entangled. The General Court made a public   
declaration charging the commissioners with &ldquo;obstructing the sentence of justice passed against that   
notorious offender,&rdquo; and with sheltering and countenancing &ldquo;his rebellion against his natural parents;&rdquo;   
with violating a court of justice, discharging a whole   
<pb n="222" id="vI222"/>

country &ldquo;from their oaths whereby they had sworn   
obedience to His Majesty's authority according to the   
Constitution of his Royal Charter;&rdquo; and with attempting to overthrow the rights of the colony under the   
charter by bringing in a military force to overawe and   
suppress the civil authorities. They denounced them   
as guilty of a perversion of their trust, and as having   
committed a breach upon the dignity of the crown, by   
pursuing a course &ldquo;derogatory to His Majesty's authority here established,&rdquo; and &ldquo;repugnant to His   
Majesty's princely and gracious intention in betrusting   
them with such a commission.&rdquo; The Court held the   
vantage-ground, and the commissioners were unable   
to dislodge them. The end of the matter was, that   
the power of the commissioners was completely broken   
down. They ingloriously gave up the contest, and   
went home to England.</p>   
<p>The instance of John Porter, Jr., to which such   
extraordinary publicity and prominence were given by   
the circumstances now related, does not bear against   
what I have said of the general prevalence, in the   
rural community of Salem Village, of parental authority and filial duty, as he was early withdrawn from it   
to pursuits that led him into totally different spheres   
of life. He had been engaged in trade, and exposed   
to vicious influences in foreign ports. In voyages to   
&ldquo;Barbadoes, and so for England, he had prodigally   
wasted and riotously expended about four hundred   
pounds.&rdquo; Besides this, he had run himself, by his   
vicious courses, into debts which his father had to pay   
<pb n="223" id="vI223"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1268">   
<figDesc>Page 223.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in order to release him from prison abroad. He came   
back the desperate character described by the General   
Court. His punishment was severe, but absolutely   
necessary, in the judgment of the whole community,   
for the safety of his parents and the preservation of   
domestic and public order.</p>   
<p>Although living in humble dwellings on plain fare,   
working with their hands for daily bread, clad in   
rude garments, and practising a frugal economy, there   
was a certain style of things about the people I am   
describing unlike what is ordinarily associated with   
our ideas of them. The men wore swords or rapiers   
as a part of their daily apparel. Their wives had domestic servants. Every farmer had his hired laborers,   
and many of them had slaves. The relation of servitude, however, differed from that on Southern plantations in many respects. The slaves, without any   
formal manumission, easily obtained their freedom, and   
often became landholders. The courteous decorum   
acquired from the example of the eminent men among   
the first planters long continued to mark the manners   
of this people; and its vestiges remain to the present   
day. It strikingly appeared in the latter half of the last   
and the earlier period of this century in the persons   
of Judge Samuel Houlton, Colonel Israel Hutchinson,   
General Moses Porter, and the late Judge Samuel   
Putnam.</p>   
<p>The wise forethought of the company in London, at   
the outset of its operations, in providing for all that   
was needful to the establishment and welfare of the   
<pb n="224" id="vI224"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1269">   
<figDesc>Page 224.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
colony, has already been described. It was most   
strikingly illustrated in the careful selection of the   
first emigrants. Men were sought out who were experienced and skilful in the various mechanic arts.   
In the early population of Salem Farms, every species   
of handicraft was represented. When the number was   
less than a hundred householders, there were weavers,   
spinners, potters, joiners, housewrights, wheelwrights,   
brickmakers and masons, blacksmiths, coopers, painters, tailors, cordwainers, glovers, tanners, millers,   
maltsters, skinners, sawyers, tray-makers, and dishturners. Every absolute want was provided for.   
These trades and callings were carried on in connection with agricultural employments, and their continuance kept carefully in view by the heads of the   
principal families. John Putnam not only gave large   
farms to each of his sons, but he trained them severally to some mechanical art. One was a weaver,   
another a bricklayer, &amp;c. The farmer was also a mechanic, and every description of useful labor held in   
equal honor.</p>   
<p>Another marked feature of this people was their military spirit. They were kept in a state of universal   
and thorough organization to protect themselves from   
Indian hostilities, or to respond, on any occasion, at a   
moment's warning, to the call of the country. The   
sentinel at the watch-house was ever on the alert.   
Authority was early obtained from the General Court   
to form a foot company. All adults of every description, including men much beyond middle life, &mdash; every   
<pb n="225" id="vI225"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1270">   
<figDesc>Page 225.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
one, in fact, who could carry a musket, belonged to it.   
Its officers were the fathers of the village. Every   
title of rank, from corporal to captain, once obtained,   
was worn ever after through life. Jonathan Walcot,   
a citizen of the highest respectability, who had married as a second wife Deliverance a daughter of   
Thomas Putnam, and was one of the deacons of the   
parish, was its captain. Nathaniel Ingersoll, the other   
deacon, is spoken of from time to time as corporal,   
then sergeant, and finally lieutenant. He served with   
that commission till late in life, and was always,   
after attaining that rank, known as either Lieutenant or Deacon Ingersoll. The eldest son of Thomas   
Putnam, a leading member of the church, a man of   
large property, and the clerk of the parish, was one   
of the sergeants, always known as such. In our narrative, with which he will be found in most unfortunate connection, I shall speak of him by that title. It   
will distinguish him from his father. This &ldquo;company&rdquo; had frequent drills, probably from the first, in   
the field left by will afterwards for that purpose by   
Nathaniel Ingersoll. Often, no doubt, it paraded   
on the open grounds around the meeting-house, or in   
the fields of Joseph Hutchinson after the harvest had   
been gathered. It marched and countermarched along   
the neighboring roads. It was almost as much thought   
of as the &ldquo;church,&rdquo; officered by the same persons, and   
composed of the same men. It was a common practice, at the close of a parade, before &ldquo;breaking line,&rdquo;   
for the captain to give notices of prayer, church,   
<pb n="226" id="vI226"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1271">   
<figDesc>Page 226.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
or parish meetings. Such men as Richard Leach,   
Thomas Fuller, and Nathaniel Putnam, esteemed it an   
honor to bear titles in this company; and held them   
ever after through life with pride, whether corporal,   
sergeant, lieutenant, or captain.</p>   
<p>A company of troopers was early formed, made up   
from the village and neighboring settlements. In the   
colonial records, under date of Oct. 8, 1662, we find   
the following: &ldquo;Mr. George Corwin for captain, Mr.   
Thomas Putnam for lieutenant, Mr. Walter Price for   
cornet, being presented to this Court as so chosen by   
the troopers of Salem, Lynn, &amp;c., the Court allows   
and approves thereof.&rdquo; The inventory of Captain   
Corwin, before cited, indicates the stylish uniform he   
wore as captain of the troopers. Each of the officers   
was a wealthy man; and it cannot be doubted that   
a parade of the company was a dashing affair. The   
lapse of time having thinned their ranks and removed   
their officers, a vigorous and successful attempt was   
made in October, 1678, to revive the company.   
Thirty-six men, belonging, as they say, &ldquo;to the reserve of Salem old troop,&rdquo; and very desirous &ldquo;of   
being serviceable to God and the country,&rdquo; petition   
the General Court to re-organize them as a troop of   
horse, and to issue the necessary commissions. They   
request the appointment of William Brown, Jr., as   
captain, and Corporal John Putnam as lieutenant.   
The petition was granted, and the commissions issued.   
Among the signers of this petition are Anthony Needham, Peter and Ezekiel Cheever, Thomas Flint,   
<pb n="227" id="vI227"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1272">   
<figDesc>Page 227.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Thomas and Benjamin Wilkins, Thomas and Jacob   
Fuller, John Procter, William Osborne, Thomas Putnam, Jr., and others of the Farms. The officers   
named were men of property and energy; and the   
company of troopers was kept up ever afterwards,   
until all danger from Indians or other foes had   
passed away.</p>   
<p>It is very observable how the military spirit with   
which this rural community was so early imbued has   
descended through all generations. Israel Putnam,   
the famous Revolutionary hero, a son of Joseph who   
was a younger brother of Sergeant Thomas and   
Deacon Edward Putnam, was born in the village.   
His brother David, much older than himself, who   
flourished in the period anterior to the Revolution,   
was a celebrated cavalry officer. Colonel Timothy   
Pickering used to mention, among the recollections of   
his boyhood, that David Putnam &ldquo;rode the best horse   
in the province.&rdquo; General Rufus Putnam, a grandson of Deacon Edward, was a distinguished brigadier   
in the army of the Revolution. There are few officers of that army whose names are more honored   
than his by encomiums from the pen of Washington:   
and praise from him was praise indeed, for it was,   
like all his other judgments, the result of careful and   
discriminating observation. In a letter to the President of Congress, dated &ldquo;At camp above Trenton   
Falls, Dec. 20, 1776,&rdquo; he speaks of the fact, that, owing   
to a neglect on the part of the Government to place the   
Engineer Department upon a proper footing, &ldquo;Colo   
<pb n="228" id="vI228"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1273">   
<figDesc>Page 228.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
nel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted,   
and taken a regiment in the State of Massachusetts.&rdquo;   
He expresses the opinion, that Putnam's qualifications   
as a military engineer were superior to those of any   
other man within his knowledge, far superior to those   
of the foreign officers whom he had seen. In a letter   
to the same, dated &ldquo;Pompton Plains,&rdquo; July 12, 1777,   
speaking of General Schuyler's army, he says, &ldquo;Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this,   
as his regiment is a part of Nixon's Brigade, who will   
answer every purpose he can possibly have for an   
engineer at this crisis.&rdquo; The high opinion of Washington took effect in his promotion as brigadier. At the end of the war, he returned to civil life,   
but was soon called back and re-commissioned as   
brigadier-general. Washington felt the need of him.   
In a letter to General Knox, Secretary of War, dated   
Aug. 13, 1792, he says, &ldquo;General Putnam merits   
thanks, in my opinion, for his plan, and the sentiments he has delivered on what he conceives to be a   
proper mode of carrying on the war against the hostile nations of Indians; and I wish he would continue   
to furnish them without reserve in future.&rdquo; During   
Washington's administration of the government under   
the Constitution, Rufus Putnam held the office of   
Surveyor-General of the United States. In addition   
to his military reputation, he will be for ever memorable as the first settler of Marietta, and founder of the   
State of Ohio.</p>   
<p>Israel Hutchinson was born in 1727. In 1757 he   
<pb n="229" id="vI229"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1274">   
<figDesc>Page 229.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was one of a scouting-party under the command of   
his neighbor, Captain Israel Herrick, that penetrated   
through the wilderness in Maine in perilous Indian   
warfare. He fought at Ticonderoga and Lake George,   
and was with Wolfe when he scaled the Heights of   
Abraham. On the morning of the 19th of April,   
1775, he led a company of minute-men, who met   
and fought the British in their bloody retreat from   
Lexington. He was prominently concerned during   
the siege of Boston; and, on its evacuation, took command at Fort Hill. He was afterwards in command   
at Forts Lee and Washington. Throughout the war,   
he, like both the Putnams, had the confidence of   
his commander-in-chief. For twenty-one years, he   
was elected to one or the other branch of the Legislature, or to the Council. He was distinguished for the   
courtesy of his manners and the dignity of his address. Colonel Enoch Putnam was also at the battle   
of Lexington, and served with honor through the Revolutionary War, as did also Captain Jeremiah Putnam,   
both of them descendants of John. Captain Samuel   
Flint was among the bravest of the brave at Lexington, exciting universal admiration by his intrepidity;   
and fell at the head of his company at Stillwater, Oct.   
7, 1777.</p>   
<p>Intelligence of the marching of the British towards   
Lexington, on the 19th of April, 1775, reached the   
lower part of Danvers about nine o'clock that morning.   
With a rapidity that is perfectly marvellous, when we   
consider the distances from each other over which the   
<pb n="230" id="vI230"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1275">   
<figDesc>Page 230.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
inhabitants were scattered, five companies, fully organized and equipped, &mdash; each of them containing men of   
the village, &mdash; rushed to the field in time to meet the   
retreating enemy at West Cambridge. It was a rally   
and a march without precedent, and never yet surpassed. The day was extremely sultry for the season;   
and the distance traversed by many of the men from   
the village, before they got into that fight, could not   
have been less than twenty miles. Seven belonging   
to Danvers companies were killed, and others wounded. A larger offering was made that day at the baptismal sacrifice to American liberty by Danvers than   
by any other town except Lexington; and no town   
represented in the scene was more remote. Of the   
men who fell on this occasion, the following appear to   
have been of the village: Samuel Cook, Benjamin   
Daland, and Perley Putnam, &mdash; the last a descendant of   
John. Their bodies were brought home, and buried   
with appropriate honors; two companies from Salem,   
and military detachments from Newburyport, Amesbury, and Salisbury participating in the ceremonies,   
and giving the soldier's tribute to their glory, by volleys over their closing graves.</p>   
<p>Moses Porter, when eighteen years of age, attracted   
attention by his heroic courage and indomitable pluck   
at Bunker Hill. He was in an artillery company, and   
would not quit his gun when almost every other man   
had fallen. His country never allowed him to quit it   
afterwards. From that day, he bore a commission in   
the army of the United States. He was retained on   
<pb n="231" id="vI231"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1276">   
<figDesc>Page 231.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
every peace establishment, always in the artillery, and   
at the head of that arm of the service for a great   
length of time, and until the day of his death. He   
was in the battle of Brandywine, and wounded in a   
subsequent fight on the banks of the Delaware. He   
was with Wayne in his campaign against the Western   
Indians, and won his share of the glory that crowned   
it in the final bloody and decisive conflict. He was   
at the head of the artillery when the war of 1812 took   
place, in active service on the Niagara frontier, and   
on the 10th of September, 1813, brevetted &ldquo;for distinguished services.&rdquo; He commanded at Norfolk, in   
Virginia, in 1814, and received great credit for the   
ability and vigilance with which he held that most vital   
point of the coast defence. At successive periods after   
the war, he was at the head of each of the geographical military divisions of the country. He died at   
Cambridge, Mass., in 1822, while in command of the   
Eastern Department, near the scene of his youthful   
glory, forty-seven years before. No man who fought at   
Bunker Hill remained so long a soldier of the United   
States. No man had so extended a record, and it was   
bright with honor from the beginning to the end. His   
pre-eminent reputation, as a disciplinarian and artillerist of the highest class, was uniformly maintained.   
He added to the sterner qualities required by professional duty a polished urbanity of manners, and a   
dignified and commanding aspect and bearing. His   
ashes rest beneath the sod of his ancestral acres in   
Salem Village.</p>

</p>   
<p>When the great war for the suppression of the   
Southern Rebellion came on, and the life of the Union   
was at stake, the same old spirit was found unabated.   
A descendant of the family of Raymonds, emulating   
the example of his ancestors, rallied his company to   
the front. At the end of the war, Lieutenant-Colonel   
John W. Raymond brought back, in command, the   
remnant of his veteran regiment, with its tattered   
banners; two of his predecessors in that commission   
having fallen in battle. The youthful patriot, William   
Lowell Putnam, who fell at Ball's Bluff on the 21st of   
October, 1861, was a direct descendant of Nathaniel   
Putnam. It is an interesting circumstance, that the   
names of men who trained in the foot company and   
with the troopers on the fields and roads about the   
village meeting-house two hundred years ago have   
re-appeared in the persons of their descendants, in the   
highest lines of service and with unsurpassed distinction, in the three great wars of America, &mdash; Major Israel, and Brigadier-General Rufus, Putnam,   
in the War of the Revolution; Brigadier-General   
Moses Porter, in the War of 1812; and Major-General   
Granville M. Dodge, in the War of the Rebellion. The   
last-named is a descendant of a hero of the Narragansett fight, and was born and educated in Salem Village.</p>   
<p>Several lawsuits, particularly in land cases, have   
been referred to. They indicate, perhaps, to some   
extent the ingredients that aggravated the terrible   
scenes we are preparing to contemplate. They served   
to keep up the general intelligence of the community   
<pb n="233" id="vI233"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1278">   
<figDesc>Page 233.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
through a period necessarily destitute of such means   
of information as we enjoy. Attendance upon courts   
of law, serving on juries, having to give testimony at   
trials, are indeed in themselves no unimportant part in   
the education of a people. Principles and questions   
of great moment are forced upon general attention,   
and become topics of discussion in places of gathering   
and at private firesides. Of this material of intelligence, the people of the village had their full share.   
It was their fate to have their minds, and more or less   
their passions, stirred up by special local controversies   
thrust upon them. As a religious society, they had difficult points of disagreement with the mother-church,   
and the town of Salem. While they were supporting   
a minister and trying to build a meeting-house for   
themselves, attempts were made to tax them to support   
the minister and build a new meeting-house in the   
town. There was a natural reluctance to part with   
them, and it was long before an arrangement could be   
made. The great distance of many of the farmers   
from the town prevented their exercising what they   
deemed their rightful influence in municipal affairs.   
They felt, that, in many respects, their interests were   
not identical, and in some absolutely at variance.   
These topics were much discussed, and with considerable feeling at times on both sides. The papers which   
remain relating to the subject show that the farmers   
understood it in all its bearings, and maintained their   
cause with clearness of perception and forcibleness of   
argument and expression. At one time, they were

<figDesc>Page 234.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
very desirous to be set off as a distinct town, but this   
could not be allowed; and, finally, a sort of compromise was effected. A partial separation &mdash; a semimunicipality &mdash; was agreed upon. Salem Village was   
the result.</p>   
<p>In 1670, a petition, with twenty signers, was presented to the town to be set off as a parish, and be   
allowed to provide a minister for themselves. In   
March, 1672, the town granted the request; and, in   
October following, the General Court approved of the   
project, and gave it legal effect. The line agreed   
upon by the town and the village is substantially defined by the vote of the former, which was as follows:   
&ldquo;All farmers that now are, or hereafter shall be, willing to join together for providing a minister among   
themselves, whose habitations are above Ipswich Highway, from the horse bridge to the wooden bridge, at the   
hither end of Mr. Endicott's Plain, and from thence on   
a west line, shall have liberty to have a minister by   
themselves; and when they shall provide and pay him   
in a maintenance, that then they shall be discharged   
from their part of Salem ministers' maintenance,&rdquo;   
&amp;c. The &ldquo;horse bridge&rdquo; was across Bass River.   
The &ldquo;wooden bridge&rdquo; was at the head of Cow-House   
or Endicott River. Ipswich highway runs along from   
one of these points to the other. The south line, beyond the wooden bridge, is seen on the map. All to   
the north of this line, and of Ipswich highway between   
the bridges, to the bounds of Beverly and Wenham on   
the east; Topsfield, Rowley Village, &mdash; since Boxford,   
<pb n="235" id="vI235"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1280">   
<figDesc>Page 235.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and Andover on the north; and Reading and Lynn on   
the west, &mdash; was the Village. Middleton, incorporated   
afterwards, absorbed a large part of its western portion; but, at the time of the witchcraft delusion, the   
Village was bounded as above described, and as in   
the map. There was a specific arrangement fixing the   
point of time when the farmers were to become exempt   
from all charges in aid of the mother-church; that is,   
as soon as they had provided for the support of a minister and the erection of a meeting-house of their own.   
It was further stipulated, that the villagers should   
not form a church until a minister was ordained; and   
that they should not settle a minister permanently without the approval of the old church, and its consent to   
proceed to an ordination. This latter restriction was   
perhaps the cause of all the subsequent troubles.</p>   
<p>Owing, as has been stated in another connection, to   
erroneous notions about the topography of the country; the incompetency perhaps, in some cases, of surveyors; and the want of due care in the General Court   
and the towns to have boundaries clearly defined, &mdash;   
uncertainties and conflicting claims arose in various   
portions of the colony, but nowhere to a greater extent   
than here. The village became involved in controversies about boundaries with each one of its neighbors; producing, at times, much exasperation. The   
documents drawn forth on these questions, as they   
appear in the record-book of the village, are written   
with ability, and show that there were men among   
them who knew how to express and enforce their   
<pb n="236" id="vI236"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1281">   
<figDesc>Page 236.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
views. The plain, lucid, well-considered style of Nathaniel Ingersoll's depositions on the court-files, in   
numerous cases, render it not improbable that his pen   
was put in requisition. Sergeant Thomas Putnam, the   
parish recorder, as he was sometimes entitled, was a   
good writer. His chirography, although not handsome,   
is singularly uniform, full, open, and clear, so easily   
legible that it is a refreshment to meet with it; and   
his sentences are well-constructed, simple, condensed,   
and to the purpose. His words do their office in conveying his meaning. No public body ever had a better   
clerk. Somehow or other, he and others, brought up   
in the woods, had contrived to acquire considerable   
efficiency in the use of the pen. Perhaps, a few who,   
like him, had parents able to afford it, had been sent to   
Ipswich or Charlestown to enjoy the privilege of what   
Cotton Mather calls &ldquo;the Cheverian education.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The southern boundary of the village was intended   
to run due west from the Ipswich road to Lynn, and   
was accordingly spoken of as &ldquo;on a west line.&rdquo; As   
originally established, it was defined by an enumeration of a variety of objects such as trees of different   
kinds and sizes, as running through the lands of John   
Felton, Nathaniel Putnam, and Anthony Needham, to   
&ldquo;a dry stump standing at the corner of Widow Pope's   
cow-pen, leaving her house and the saw-mill within   
the farmer's range,&rdquo; and so on to &ldquo;the top of the hill   
by the highway side near Berry Pond.&rdquo; From the   
changeable conditions of some of the objects, and a   
diversity of methods adopted by surveyors, &mdash; many   
<pb n="237" id="vI237"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1282">   
<figDesc>Page 237.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of them being unacquainted with, or making no allowance for, the variation of the compass, &mdash; controversies   
arose with the mother-town: and some proprietors,   
like the Gardners, were left in doubt how the line   
affected them; and there was, in consequence, much   
disquietude The line was not accurately run until   
1700.</p>   
<p>It is observable, that the &ldquo;saw-mill&rdquo; is still in   
operation on the same spot. The &ldquo;cow-pen,&rdquo; then on   
the south side of the mill, was, more than a century   
ago, removed to the north side, where it has remained   
ever since. This estate has interesting reminiscences.   
It was an original grant in January, 1640, to Edward   
Norris, at the time of his settlement as pastor of the   
First Church in Salem. He sold to Eleanor Trussler   
in 1654. It then went into the possession of Henry   
Phelps, who sold to Joseph Pope in 1664. His widow,   
Gertrude, owned it in 1672. In 1793, Eleazer Pope   
sold to Nathaniel Ropes, son of Judge Ropes, of   
Salem. His heirs sold it back to the Phelpses; and it   
is now in the possession of the Rev. Willard Spaulding,   
of Salem. Originally given as an ordination present   
to a minister of the old town, it has, after the lapse   
of two hundred and twenty-six years, come round into   
the hands of another. The house in which the Popes   
lived one hundred and twenty-nine years, and the   
families that succeeded them for above half a century   
more, &mdash; a venerable and picturesque specimen of the   
rural architecture, in its best form, of the earliest   
times, &mdash; has, within the last ten years, given place to a   
<pb n="238" id="vI238"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1283">   
<figDesc>Page 238.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
new one on the same spot. In that old house, besides   
unnumbered and unknown instances of the same sort,   
Israel Putnam conducted his courtship; and there, on   
the 19th of July, 1739, he was married to Hannah,   
daughter of Joseph Pope.</p>   
<p>Contests for what they deemed their rights with the   
old church and the border towns and their own town,   
as in the case just mentioned, undoubtedly produced a   
bad effect upon the temper of the people, by occasional expenses that consumed their substance, and   
incidents that sowed the seeds of personal animosities;   
preparing the way for that dreadful convulsion which   
was near at hand. At the very time when the witchcraft frenzy broke out, they were in the crisis of an   
exasperating conflict with Topsfield, occasioned by a   
wrong done them by the General Court. This requires to be explained, as it can be, by a collation of   
facts of record.</p>   
<p>On the 3d of March, 1636, the General Court passed   
an order that the bounds of Salem, Ipswich, and New, should extend six miles into the country. It   
was afterwards defined to mean that &ldquo;the six-mile   
extent,&rdquo; as it was called, should be measured from the   
meeting-houses of the respective towns. On the 5th   
of November, 1639, the General Court passed an order   
in these words: &ldquo;Whereas the inhabitants of Salem   
have agreed to plant a village near the river that runs   
to Ipswich, it is ordered that all the land near their   
bounds between Salem and the said river, not belonging to any other town or person by any former grant,   
<pb n="239" id="vI239"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1284">   
<figDesc>Page 239.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
shall belong to the said village.&rdquo; On the strength of   
this order, the farmers in that part of Salem pushed   
settlements out beyond the &ldquo;six-mile extent,&rdquo; over   
the ground thus pledged to them; cleared off the forests, built houses, brought the land under culture,   
erected bridges, made roads, and fulfilled their part of   
the contract by preparing to establish their village.   
Four years after the General Court had thus pledged   
to &ldquo;inhabitants of Salem&rdquo; the privileges of a village   
organization on the lands between &ldquo;Salem and the   
said river,&rdquo; they authorized some inhabitants of Ipswich, who had gone there, to establish the village on   
the territory, independent of the Salem men. This   
was an unjustifiable and flagrant violation of the   
stipulated agreement on the part of the General   
Court; because it appears by their own records, that   
Salem farmers had promptly fulfilled the condition on   
their part by going directly upon the ground, and getting farms under way there before 1643. This careless and indefensible procedure by the General Court   
was the cause of interminable trouble and strife on   
the tract between Salem bounds and the river, introduced the elements of discord, and gave a color of   
legal justification to a conflict of authority between   
Salem and Ipswich men. It sowed the seeds of animosities which aggravated the scenes that occurred in   
Salem Village in 1692. In 1658, the General Court   
passed an order creating the town of Topsfield, including the larger part of these lands within its limits.   
No <unclear></unclear> was paid to the remonstrances, against these   
<pb n="240" id="vI240"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1285">   
<figDesc>Page 240.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
proceedings, of the Salem farmers, who found themselves, without their consent, permanently bereft of   
the benefit that had been promised them, cut off   
from all connection with the town of Salem, to which   
they originally belonged, and put in the outskirts of   
another town. It was a clear case of wrong, and   
ought to have been rectified. But public bodies are   
more reluctant even than individuals to acknowledge   
themselves in fault. The people of Salem Village   
joined in earnest protests against the acts of the General Court. The old town of Salem declared by a   
public vote, that they had always regarded the lands   
in controversy as belonging to the village which, under   
the plighted faith of the General Court, their inhabitants had been forming. But it was all in vain.   
Neither remedy nor reparation could be obtained.   
The struggle against this injustice lasted until some   
time after the witchcraft occurrences had terminated,   
and was finally brought to a close by an order of the   
Court, that the people on the territory might maintain   
parish relations with Salem Village or with Topsfield,   
at their individual option. Entire satisfaction was   
never realized until, in 1728, they were incorporated, in accordance with their petition, into a township, under the name of Middleton, with parts of   
Topsfield, Boxford, and Andover added. During a   
period of half a century, this grievance remained unadjusted. The proceedings on the part of the village   
in its public action, as shown in the records, were conducted with skill, ability, and firmness. But the collisions   
<pb n="241" id="vI241"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1286">   
<figDesc>Page 241.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that occurred between particular parties were   
violent and bitter. Salem settlers were called to pay   
parish and town rates to Topsfield, but refused to do   
it. Constables and tax-collectors were defied. Topsfield went so far as to claim not only unoccupied   
lands, but lands within fence, with houses on them,   
and families within them, and orchards and growing   
fields around them, as part of its &ldquo;commons;&rdquo; and it   
disputed the titles given by Salem. Of course, the   
question went, in various forms, into the county   
courts; but sometimes, there is reason to believe, it   
came to a rougher arbitrament, in the depths of the   
woods, between man and man.</p>   
<p>John Putnam had gone out and settled lands between the &ldquo;six-mile extent&rdquo; of Salem and Ipswich   
River. Some of his sons had gone with him. They   
had two dwelling-houses, cultivated meadows, orchards,   
&amp;c. Isaac Burton says, that, one day, when near John   
Nichols's house, he heard a tree fall in the woods; and   
that he went to see who was chopping there. It seems   
that Jacob Towne and John How, Topsfield men, had   
come in defiance of John Putnam, and cut down a tree   
before his face. As they were two to one, Putnam had   
to swallow the insult; but he was not the man to let it   
rest so. He went out shortly after, accompanied by an   
adequate force of sons and nephews, and proceeded to   
fell the trees. The sound of the axes reached the ears   
of the Topsfield men; and Isaac Easty, Sr., John Easty,   
John Towne, and Joseph Towne, Jr., undertook to put   
a stop to the operation. On reaching the spot, they   
<pb n="242" id="vI242"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1287">   
<figDesc>Page 242.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
warned Putnam against cutting timber. He replied,   
&ldquo;The timber now and here cut down has been felled   
by me and my orders;&rdquo; and he proceeded to say, &ldquo;I   
will keep cutting and carrying away from this land   
until next March.&rdquo; They asked him, &ldquo;What, by   
violence?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Aye, by violence. You   
may sue me: you know where I dwell;&rdquo; and, turning to his company, he said, &ldquo;Fall on.&rdquo; The Putnams were evidently the stronger party; and the   
Topsfield men, counting forces, concluded, in their   
turn, that discretion, at that time, was the better   
part of valor. Such scenes occurred on the disputed   
ground for a whole generation. It is not wonderful   
that all sorts of animosities were kindled. The fact   
will be borne in mind, that Isaac Easty and son, with   
John Towne and son, constituted the Topsfield force   
on this occasion.</p>   
<p>It cannot be doubted, that these controversies with   
the surrounding towns, the mother-church, and the   
General Court itself, gradually engendered a very   
bad state of feeling. The people were deeply impressed with a conviction that they had been wronged   
all around and all the way through. They felt that   
the whole world was against them; and when, by a   
train of mischievous influences, hell itself seemed to   
be let loose upon them, it is not strange that they were   
driven to distraction.</p>   
<p>We come, at last, to that chapter in the history of   
Salem Village which will lead us directly to the witchcraft delusion. Its religious organization was somewhat   
<pb n="243" id="vI243"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1288">   
<figDesc>Page 243.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
peculiar; and, although instituted by a particular   
arrangement made by the General Court, was, in one   
or two features, a complete departure from the ecclesiastical polity elsewhere rigidly enforced. It was a   
congregation forbidden, for the time being, to have   
a church. It was a society for religious worship, administered, not by professors of religion or by persons   
regarded at all in a religious light, but by householders. The people of the village liked it, perhaps,   
all the better for this; and they took hold of it with a   
will. Joseph Houlton gave to the parish five and   
a half acres of land, in the centre of the village, for   
the use of the minister. A parsonage-house was   
built, &ldquo;forty-two feet in length, twenty feet broad,   
thirteen-feet stud, four chimneys, and no gable-ends.&rdquo;   
It was the custom to have a leanto attached to their   
houses, generally on the northern side; and one was   
finally added to the parsonage. There was a garden within the enclosure. Joseph Hutchinson gave   
an acre out of his broad meadow as a site for the   
meeting-house and it was erected; &ldquo;thirty-four feet   
in length, twenty-eight feet broad, and sixteen feet between joints.&rdquo; Two end galleries were added, and a   
&ldquo;canopy&rdquo; placed over the pulpit. The mother-church,   
having about the same time built a new meeting-house,   
voted to give &ldquo;the farmers their old pulpit and deacons seats,&rdquo; which were brought up and duly installed. In the course of these proceedings, some slight   
differences arose among them about matters of detail,   
but not more than is usual in such cases. In order   
<pb n="244" id="vI244"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1289">   
<figDesc>Page 244.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to despatch at once all that may be required to be said   
about the meeting-houses of the village, it may be   
allowable here to mention, that the original building   
did not survive the century. In 1700, partly because   
the growth of the society began to require it, but   
mainly, no doubt, to escape from the painful associations which had become connected with it, a new   
meeting-house was built on another site. The old one   
was dismantled of all its removable parts, and the site   
reverted to Joseph Hutchinson. It is supposed that he   
removed the frame to the other side of the road, and   
converted it into a barn; and that it was used as such   
until, in the memory of old persons now living, it   
mouldered, crumbled into powder-post, and sunk to   
the ground. It stood, after being converted into a   
barn, on the south side of the road, nearly in front of   
Joseph Hutchinson's homestead. Hutchinson's dwelling was probably some distance further down in   
the field, where the remains of an old cellar are still   
to be seen. Nathaniel Ingersoll gave the land for the   
new meeting-house. The records contain the vote,   
that it &ldquo;shall stand upon Watch-House Hill, before   
Deacon Ingersoll's door.&rdquo; The meeting-houses of the   
society have stood there ever since. At that time, it   
was an elevated spot, probably covered with the original forest; for the work of clearing, levelling, and   
preparing it for occupancy was so considerable as to   
require a special provision. The labor and expense   
of the operation were put on that portion of the   
<pb n="245" id="vI245"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1290">   
<figDesc>Page 245.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
congregation brought nearer to the meeting-house by   
the change of the site.</p>   
<p>In urging their petition to be set off as an independent parish, distinct from the First Church in   
Salem, the people of the village declared, that, if they   
could not have a ministry established among them,   
they would soon &ldquo;become worse than the heathen   
around them.&rdquo; Little did they foresee the immediate,   
long-continued, and terrible effects that were to follow   
the boon thus prayed for. The establishment of the   
ministry among them was not merely an opening of   
Pandora's box: it was emptying and shaking it over   
their heads. It led them to a condition of bitterness   
and violence, of confusion and convulsion, of horror   
and misery, of cruelty and outrage, worse than heathen   
ever experienced or savages inflicted.</p>   
<p>James Bayley of Newbury, born Sept. 12, 1650,   
a graduate of Harvard College in the class of 1669,   
was employed to preach at the village. In October,   
1671, he transferred his relations from the church in   
Newbury to the First Church in Salem. It seems that   
several persons of considerable influence in the village   
were dissatisfied with the manner in which he had   
been brought forward, and became prejudiced against   
him. The disaffection was not removed, but suffered   
to take deep root in their minds. The parish soon   
became the scene of one of those violent and heated   
dissensions to which religious societies are sometimes   
liable. The unhappy strife was aggravated from   
day to day, until it spread alienation and acrimony   
<pb n="246" id="vI246"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1291">   
<figDesc>Page 246.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
throughout the village. A majority of the people   
were all along in favor of Bayley; but the minority were implacable. His engagement to preach was   
renewed from year to year. At length, the controversy   
waxed so warm that some definite action became   
necessary. On the 10th of March, 1679, both parties   
applied to the mother-church for advice. A paper   
was presented by his opponents, with sixteen, and   
another from his friends, with thirty-nine signers.   
There was still another, also in his favor, signed by   
ten persons living near, but not within the village line.   
Although the number of his opponents was so much   
less than of his friends, they included persons, such   
as Nathaniel Putnam and Bray Wilkins, of large estates and families, and much general influence; and it   
is evident that the First Church was not inclined   
wholly to disregard them. The record of that church   
says, &ldquo;There was much agitation on both sides, and   
divers things were spoken of by the brethren; but the   
business being long, and many of the brethren gone,   
we could not make a church act of advice in the case;   
therefore it was left to another time.&rdquo; At a meeting   
on the 22d of April, the Salem Church advised the   
minority &ldquo;to submit to the generality for the present;   
but, when a church should be formed there, &ldquo;then   
they might choose him or any other.&rdquo; This advice   
does not appear to have satisfied either party; and the   
quarrel went on with renewed vehemence on both   
sides. At length, it reached such a pitch that it   
became necessary to carry it up to the General   
<pb n="247" id="vI247"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1292">   
<figDesc>Page 247.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Court. The whole affair was investigated by that   
body, and all the papers that had passed in relation   
to it were adduced. They are quite voluminous,   
and on file in the office of the Secretary of State,   
in Boston. These interesting and curious documents illustrate the energy of action of both parties;   
and give, it is probable, the best picture anywhere   
to be found of a first-rate parish controversy of the   
olden times.</p>   
<p>The General Court came down upon the case with   
a strong hand. They decided in favor of Bayley,   
whom they pronounced &ldquo;orthodox, and competently   
able, and of a blameless and self-denying conversation;&rdquo; and they &ldquo;do order, that Mr. Bayley be continued and settled the minister of that place, and that   
he be allowed sixty pounds per annum for his maintenance, one-third part thereof in money, the other   
two-thirds in provisions of all sorts such as a family   
needs, at equal prices, and fuel for his family's occasions; this sum to be paid by the inhabitants of that   
place.&rdquo; This was thirteen pounds a year more than   
Bayley's friends had ever voted for him. To make   
the matter sure, the General Court required the parish to choose three or five men among themselves to   
apportion every man's share of the tax to secure the   
sixty pounds: and, if any difficulty should occur in   
getting men among themselves to perform this duty,   
they appointed to act, in that event, Mr. Batter, Captain Jonathan Corwin, and Captain Price, of the   
old parish of Salem, to make the rate; and gave   
<pb n="248" id="vI248"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1293">   
<figDesc>Page 248.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
ample power to the constable of the village or the   
marshal of the county, to enforce the collection of it,   
by distress and attachment, if any should neglect   
or refuse to pay the sum assessed upon him. To   
make it still more certain that Mr. Bayley should get   
his money, they ordered &ldquo;that all the rate is to be   
paid in for the use of the ministry unto two persons   
chosen by the householders to supply the place of   
deacons for the time, who are to reckon with the   
people, and to deliver the same to the said minister or   
to his order.&rdquo; The arrangement as to the agency of   
deacons was &ldquo;to continue until the Court shall take   
further order, or that there be a church of Christ   
orderly gathered and approved in that place.&rdquo; This   
procedure of the Court was a pretty high-handed   
stretch of power even for those days; and giving the   
appointment of officers, with the title and character of   
deacons to mere householders, and where there was no   
church or organized body of professed believers, was   
in absolute conflict with the whole tenor and spirit of   
the ecclesiastical system then in force and rigidly   
maintained elsewhere throughout the colony. The   
Court seems itself to have been alarmed at the extent   
to which it had gone in forcing Mr. Bayley upon the   
people of Salem Village, and fell back, in conclusion,   
upon the following proviso: &ldquo;This order shall continue for one year only from the last of September   
last past.&rdquo; The date of the order was the 15th of   
October, 1679. It had less than a year to run. In   
fact, the order, after all, before it comes to the end, is   
<pb n="249" id="vI249"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1294">   
<figDesc>Page 249.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
diluted into a mere recommendation of Mr. Bayley.   
&ldquo;In the mean while, all parties,&rdquo; it is hoped, will &ldquo;endeavor an agreement in him or some other meet person   
for a minister among them;&rdquo; but the General Court   
takes care to wind up by demanding &ldquo;five pounds for   
hearing the case, the whole number of villagers equally   
to bear their proportion thereof.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>While the power thus incautiously conceded to   
householders was duly noted, the apparently formidable action of the Court did not in the least alarm the   
opposition, or in the slightest degree abate their zeal.   
The householders continued, as before, to manage all   
affairs relating to the ministry in general meetings of   
the inhabitants. They proceeded at once to elect their   
two deacons. &ldquo;Corporal Nathaniel Ingersoll&rdquo; was   
one of them; and he continued to hold the office, in   
parish and in church, for forty years.</p>   
<p>As no attention was paid to the order of the General   
Court, so far as it attempted to fasten Mr. Bayley   
upon the parish; as the church in Salem would not   
take the responsibility of recommending his ordination   
in the face of such an opposition; and as it was out   
of the question to think of reconciling or reducing   
it, Mr. Bayley concluded to retire from the conflict   
and quit the field; and his ministry in the village   
came to an end. As evidence that the heat of this   
protracted controversy had not consumed all just and   
considerate sentiments in the minds of the people, I   
present the substance of a deed found in the Essex   
Registry. It will be noticed, that the most conspicuous

of Mr. Bayley's opponents, Nathaniel Putnam, is   
one of the parties to the instrument.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Putnam, Sr., Nathaniel Putnam, Sr.,   
Thomas Fuller, Sr., John Putnam, Sr., and Joseph   
Hutchinson, Sr. Deed of gift to Mr. James Bayley.   
Whereas, Mr. James Bayley, minister of the gospel,   
now resident of Salem Village, hath been in the exercise of his gifts by preaching amongst us several years,   
having had a call thereunto by the inhabitants of the   
place; and at the said Mr. Bayley's first coming   
amongst us, we above-named put the said Bayley in   
possession of a suitable accommodation of land and   
meadow, for his more comfortable subsistence amongst   
us. But the providence of God having so ordered it,   
that the said Mr. Bayley doth not continue amongst   
us in the work of the ministry, yet, considering the   
premises, and as a testimony of our good affection to   
the said Mr. Bayley, and as full satisfaction of all demands of us or any of us, of land relating to the   
premises, do by these presents fully grant, &amp;c., to said   
Bayley&rdquo; twenty-eight acres of upland, and thirteen   
acres of meadow in all. The several lots are described in the deed, and constitute a very valuable   
property. The instrument bears date May 6, 1680.   
Mr. Bayley's residence is indicated on the map. The   
land on which it stood belonged to the part contributed by Nathaniel Putnam, with some acres in front   
of it contributed by Joseph Hutchinson. He continued to own and occasionally occupy his property in   
the village for some years after the witchcraft transactions.   
<pb n="251" id="vI251"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1296">   
<figDesc>Page 251.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
He left the ministry, and prepared himself   
for the profession of medicine, which he practised in   
Roxbury. He died on the 17th of January, 1707.</p>   
<p>It is not very easy to ascertain from the parish records, or from the mass of papers in the State-house   
files, the precise grounds of the obstinate controversy   
in reference to him. It is evident that it began in   
consequence of some alleged irregularity in the proceedings that led to his first engagement to preach at   
the village. There are intimations, that, in the tone   
and style of his preaching, he did not quite come up   
to the mark required by some. The objection does   
not seem to have been against his talents or learning,   
but, rather, that he did not take hold with sufficient   
vehemence, or handle with sufficient zeal and warmth,   
points then engrossing attention. One or two expressions in the papers which proceeded from his opponents   
seem to hint that he had not the degree of strictness or   
severity in his aspect or ways thought necessary in a   
minister. Papers in the files of the County Court   
bring to light, perhaps, precisely the shape in which   
the charges against him had currency. On the 4th of   
April, 1679, complaint was made by Thomas and John   
Putnam, Srs., Daniel Andrew, and Nathaniel Ingersoll,   
against Henry Kenny &ldquo;for slandering our minister,   
Mr. Bayley, by reporting that he doth not perform   
family duties in his family.&rdquo; This was an expression   
then in use for &ldquo;family prayers.&rdquo; One young woman   
testified as follows: &ldquo;Being at Mr. Bayley's house   
three weeks together, I never heard Mr. Bayley read a   
<pb n="252" id="vI252"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1297">   
<figDesc>Page 252.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
chapter, nor expound on any part of the Scripture,   
which was a great grief to me.&rdquo; On the other hand,   
three men and one woman depose thus: &ldquo;Having, for   
a year, some more, some less, since Mr. Bayley's   
coming to Salem Farms, lived at his house, we testify   
to our knowledge, that he hath continually performed   
family duties, morning and evening, unless sickness   
or some other unavoidable providence hath prevented.&rdquo; Two of the above witnesses depose more   
specifically as follows: &ldquo;We testify, &mdash; one of us   
being a boarder at Mr. Bayley's house, at times, for   
two or three years, and the other having lived there   
about a year and a quarter, &mdash; that Mr. Bayley did not   
only constantly perform family prayers twice a day,   
except some unusual providence at any time prevented,   
but also did sometimes read the Scriptures and other   
profitable books, and also repeat his own sermons in   
his family that he preached upon the Lord's Days;   
always endeavoring to keep good order in his family,   
carrying himself exemplarily therein.&rdquo; The evidence   
against Bayley was afterwards found to be unworthy of   
credit, and was wholly overborne at the time by unimpeachable testimony in his favor. The conclusion   
seems to be safe, from all the papers and proceedings,   
that Mr. Bayley was, as the General Court had pronounced him, &ldquo;of a blameless conversation.&rdquo; A   
letter from him to his people, relating to the disaffection of some, and expressing a willingness to relinquish his position, if the interests of the society   
would thereby be promoted, is among the papers. It   
<pb n="253" id="vI253"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1298">   
<figDesc>Page 253.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
is creditable to his understanding, temper, and character.</p>   
<p>The opposition to Mr. Bayley laid the train for all   
the disastrous and terrible scenes that followed. His   
wife was Mary Carr, of Salisbury. Her family, besides land in that town, owned the large island in the   
Merrimack, just above Newburyport, called still by   
their name, and occupied by their descendants to this   
day. Mrs. Bayley brought with her to the village   
a younger sister, Ann, who, when scarcely sixteen   
years of age, &mdash; on the 25th of November, 1678, &mdash;   
married Sergeant Thomas Putnam. The Carrs were   
evidently well-educated young women; and there is   
every indication that Ann was possessed of qualities   
which gave her much influence in private circles.   
Her husband was the eldest son of the richest man   
in the village, had the most powerful and extensive connections, was a member of the company of   
troopers, had been in the Narragansett fight, and, as   
his records show, was a well-educated person. Marriage with him brought his wife into the centre of the   
great Putnam family; and, her sister Bayley being   
the wife of the minister, a powerful combination was   
secured to his support. The opposition so obstinately   
made to his settlement, appearing to his friends, as it   
does to us, so unreasonable, if not perverse, engendered   
a very bitter resentment, which spread from house to   
house. Every thing served to aggravate it. The disregard, by the opposition, of the advice of the old   
church to agree to his ordination, and of the strong   
<pb n="254" id="vI254"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1299">   
<figDesc>Page 254.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
endorsement of him by the General Court; and the   
failure of either of those bodies to take the responsibility of proceeding to his ordination, &mdash; made the dissatisfaction and disappointment of his friends intense.   
His connection by marriage with such a wide-spread   
influence, and the harmony and happiness of social   
life, made his settlement so very desirable that his   
friends could not account for the resistance made to it.   
His amiable character, which had been shown to be   
proof against slander; and his domestic bereavements   
in the loss of his wife and three children, &mdash; made him   
dear to his friends. More than three to one earnestly,   
persistently, from year to year, begged that he might be   
ordained; but what was regarded as an unworthy faction was permitted to succeed in preventing it. All   
these things sunk deep into the heart of the wife of   
Sergeant Thomas Putnam. She was a woman of an   
excitable temperament, and, by her talents, zeal, and   
personal qualities, wrought all within her influence   
into the highest state of exasperation. This must be   
borne in mind when we reach the details of our story.   
It is the key to all that followed.</p>   
<p>The friends of Bayley, while they yielded to his determination to withdraw from his disagreeable position, never relinquished the hope to get him back, but   
renewed a struggle to that end, whenever a vacancy   
occurred in the village ministry. With that object in   
view, they were unwise and unjust enough to cherish   
aversion to every one who succeeded him, and thus kept   
alive the fatal elements of division. But it is due to   
<pb n="255" id="vI255"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1300">   
<figDesc>Page 255.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
him to say, that he does not appear to have been at all   
responsible for the course of his friends. Although   
retaining his property in the village, and often residing there, there is no indication that he had a hand in   
subsequent proceedings, or was in the slightest degree   
connected with the troubles that afterwards arose. Arts   
were used to inveigle him into the witchcraft prosecucutions: his resentments, if he had any, were invoked;   
but in vain. He resisted attempts, which were made   
with more effect upon one of his successors, to rouse   
his passions against parties accused. He kept himself   
free from the whole affair. His name nowhere appears   
as complainant, witness, or actor in any shape. He   
was, so far as the evidence goes, a peaceable, prudent,   
kind, and good man; and if the people of Salem Village had been wise enough, or been permitted, to settle   
him, the world might never have known that such a   
place existed.</p>   
<p>George Burroughs, in November, 1680, was engaged   
to preach at Salem Village. He is supposed to have   
been born in Scituate; but his origin is as uncertain   
as his history was sad, and his end tragical. He was   
a graduate of Harvard College in the class of 1670.   
What little is known of him shows that he was a man   
of ability and integrity. Papers on file in the State   
House prove, that, in the district of Maine, where he   
lived and preached before and after his settlement at   
the village, he was regarded with confidence by his   
neighbors, and looked up to as a friend and counsellor.   
Certain incidents are related, which prove that he was   
<pb n="256" id="vI256"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1301">   
<figDesc>Page 256.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
self-denying, generous, and public-spirited, laboring in   
humility and with zeal in the midst of great privations, sharing the exposures of his people to Indian   
violence, and experiencing all the sufferings of an   
unprotected outpost. In 1676, while preaching at   
Casco, &mdash; now Portland, &mdash; the entire settlement was   
broken up by an Indian assault. Thirty-two of the   
inhabitants were killed or carried into captivity. Mr.   
Burroughs escaped to an island in the bay, from which   
he was rescued by timely aid from the mainland. He   
wrote an account of the catastrophe, communicated by   
Brian Pendleton to the Governor and Council at Boston. In 1683 he was again at Casco; and, again   
driven off by the Indians in 1690, transferred his   
labors to Wells. A grant of one hundred and fifty   
acres of land was made to him, included in the site   
of the present city of Portland. As population began   
to thicken near the spot, the town applied to him to   
relinquish a part of it, other lands to be given him in   
exchange. In their account of the transaction, they   
state, that, in answer to their application, Mr. Burroughs said they were welcome to it; that he freely   
gave it back, &ldquo;not desiring any land anywhere else,   
nor any thing else in consideration thereof.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>In a vote passed at a meeting of Salem Village parish, Feb. 10, 1681, it was agreed that Mr. Burroughs   
should receive &pound;93. 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 8<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> per annum for three years,   
and &pound;60 per annum afterwards. I suppose that he   
had no money or property of any kind. The parsonage was out of repair; and the larger sum for the first   
<pb n="257" id="vI257"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1302">   
<figDesc>Page 257.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
three years, amounting to &pound;100, in three instalments,   
was to be given him as an outfit in housekeeping.   
Immediately upon coming to the village to reside, he   
encountered the hostility of those persons who, as the   
special friends of Mr. Bayley, allowed their prejudices   
to be concentrated upon his innocent successor. The   
unhappy animosities arising from this source entirely   
demoralized the Society, and, besides making it otherwise very uncomfortable to a minister, led to a neglect   
and derangement of all financial affairs. In September, 1681, Mr. Burroughs's wife died, and he had to   
run in debt for her funeral expenses. Rates were not   
collected, and his salary was in arrears. In making   
the contract with the parish, he had taken care to add,   
at the end of the articles, these words, &ldquo;All is to be   
understood so long as I have gospel encouragement.&rdquo;   
It is not improbable that there was a lack of sympathy between him and the ministers in this part of the   
country. He concluded that no benefit would accrue   
from calling a council to put things into order; and, as   
he was in despair of remedying the evils that had become fastened upon the village, he concluded to give   
up the idea of getting a settlement of his accounts,   
abandoned his claims altogether, and removed from   
the village.</p>   
<p>At the April term of Court in Ipswich, 1683, a committee of the parish petitioned for relief, stating that   
Mr. Burroughs had left them, and that they had been   
without services in their meeting-house for four sabbaths. They pray the Court, that &ldquo;they be pleased to   
<pb n="258" id="vI258"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1303">   
<figDesc>Page 258.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
write to Mr. Burroughs, requiring him to attend an   
orderly hearing and clearing up the case,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to   
come to account&rdquo; with them. The Court accordingly   
directed a meeting of the inhabitants to be held, and   
wrote to Mr. Burroughs to attend it. When the day   
came, the Court sent a letter to be read at the meeting,   
directing the parties to &ldquo;reckon,&rdquo; and settle their accounts. What transpired at this curious meeting is   
best given by presenting the documents on file in a   
case that went into Court. They show the proceedings   
that interrupted the &ldquo;reckoning&rdquo; at the meeting in a   
most extraordinary manner: &mdash;</p>   
<p>[<hi rend="smallcaps">County Court,</hi> June, 1683. &mdash; Lieutenant John Putnam   
<hi rend="italics">versus</hi> Mr. George Burroughs. Action of debt for two gallons of   
Canary wine, and cloth, &amp;c., bought of Mr. Gedney on John   
Putnam's account, for the funeral of Mrs. Burroughs.]</p>   
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Deposition.</hi></p>   
<p>&ldquo;We, whose names are underwritten, testify and say, that   
at a public meeting of the people of Salem Farms, April 24,   
1683, we heard a letter read, which letter was sent from the   
Court. After the said letter was read, Mr. Burroughs came   
in. After the said Burroughs had been a while in, he asked   
`whether they took up with the advice of the Court, given   
in the letter, or whether they rejected it.' The moderator   
made answer, `Yes, we take up with it;' and not a man   
contradicted it to any of our hearing. After this was   
passed, was a discourse of settling accounts between the   
said Burroughs and the inhabitants, and issuing things in   
peace, and parting in love, as they came together in love.   
Further, we say that the second, third, and fourth days of   
the following week were agreed upon by Mr. Burroughs and   
<pb n="259" id="vI259"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1304">   
<figDesc>Page 259.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the people to be the days for every man to come in and to   
reckon with the said Burroughs; and so they adjourned the   
meeting to the last of the aforesaid three days, in the afternoon, then to make up the whole account in public.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;We further testify and say, that, May the second, 1683,   
Mr. Burroughs and the inhabitants met at the meeting to make up accounts in public, according to their   
agreement the meeting before; and, just as the said Burroughs began to give in his accounts, the marshal came in,   
and, after a while, went up to John Putnam, Sr., and whispered to him, and said Putnam said to him, `You know   
what you have to do: do your office.' Then the marshal   
came to Mr. Burroughs, and said, `Sir, I have a writing to   
read to you.' Then he read the attachment, and demanded   
goods. Mr. Burroughs answered, `that he had no goods to   
show, and that he was now reckoning with the inhabitants,   
for we know not yet who is in debt, but there was his body.'   
As we were ready to go out of the meeting-house, Mr. Burroughs said, `Well, what will you do with me?' Then   
the marshal went to John Putnam, Sr., and said to him,   
`What shall I do?' The said Putnam replied, `You know   
your business.' And then the said Putnam went to his   
brother, Thomas Putnam, and pulled him by the coat; and   
they went out of the house together, and presently came in   
again. Then said John Putnam, `Marshal, take your   
prisoner, and have him up to the ordinary, &mdash; that is a public house, &mdash; and secure him till the morning.'</p>

<p>The above document illustrates the general position of the Putnam family through all the troubles   
of the Salem Village parish. Thomas and John were   
the heads of two of its branches, and participated   
in the proceedings against Burroughs. Nathaniel   
generally was on the other side in the course of the   
various controversies which finally culminated in the   
witchcraft delusion. His son, John Putnam, Jr., on   
this occasion, was a witness friendly to Mr. Burroughs.   
Nathaniel Ingersoll does not appear to have been a   
partisan on either side. His sympathies, generally,   
were with the friends of Bayley; but, on this occasion, his sense of justice led him to take the lead in   
behalf of Burroughs. Other depositions are as follows: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Thomas Haynes,</hi> aged thirty-two   
years or thereabouts. &mdash; Testifieth and saith, that, at a meeting of the inhabitants of Salem Farms, May the second,   
1683, after the marshal had read John Putnam's attachment   
to Mr. Burroughs, then Mr. Burroughs asked Putnam `what   
money it was he attached him for.' John Putnam answered, `For five pounds and odd money at Shippen's at   
Boston, and for thirteen shillings at his father Gedney's,   
and for twenty-four shillings at Mrs. Darby's;' that then   
Nathaniel Ingersoll stood up, and said, `Lieutenant, I wonder that you attach Mr. Burroughs for the money at Darby's   
and your father Gedney's, when, to my knowledge, you and   
Mr. Burroughs have reckoned and balanced accounts two or   
three times since, as you say, it was due, and you never   
made any mention of it when you reckoned with Mr. Burroughs.' John Putnam answered, `It is true, and I own it.'   
<pb n="261" id="vI261"/>

Samuel Sibley, aged twenty-four years or thereabouts, testifieth to all above written.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Nathaniel Ingersoll,</hi> <hi rend="italics">aged, &amp;c.</hi>   
&mdash; Testifieth, that I heard Mr. Burroughs ask Lieutenant   
John Putnam to give him a bill to Mr. Shippen. The said   
Putnam asked the said Burroughs how much he would take   
up at Mr. Shippen's. Mr. Burroughs said it might be five   
pounds; but, after the said Burroughs had considered a   
little, he said to the said Putnam, `It may be it might come   
to more:' therefore he would have him give him a bill to   
the value of five or six pounds, &mdash; when Putnam answered,   
it was all one to him. Then the said Putnam went and writ   
it, and read it to Mr. Burroughs, and said to him that it   
should go for part of the &pound;33. 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 8<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> for which he had given   
a bill to him in behalf of the inhabitants. I, Hannah Ingersoll, aged forty-six years or thereabouts, testify the same.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>It seems by the foregoing, that Mr. Burroughs had   
presented a bill, of the amount just mentioned, to   
John Putnam, who, as chairman of the committee the   
preceding year, represented the inhabitants; and it   
was deliberately and formally agreed, that the sum   
borrowed of Putnam by Burroughs should &ldquo;go for   
part of it.&rdquo; The records of the parish show, that, on   
the 24th of May, &mdash; three weeks after this meeting   
&ldquo;for reckoning,&rdquo; &mdash; a vote was passed to raise, by a   
rate, &ldquo;fifteen pounds for Mr. Burroughs for the last   
quarter of a year he preached with us.&rdquo; At a meeting in December of the same year, a rate was ordered,   
to pay the debts of the parish, amounting to &pound;52.   
1<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 1<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> On the 22d of the ensuing February, the parish voted to raise &ldquo;fifteen pounds for Mr. Burroughs.&rdquo;

The record of a meeting in April, 1684, contains an   
order, left on the book, with Mr. Burroughs's proper   
signature, authorizing Lieutenant Thomas Putnam   
to receive of the committee &ldquo;what is due to me from   
the inhabitants of Salem Farms.&rdquo; Thus it is evident,   
that, at the very day when the ruthless proceedings   
above described took place, a considerable balance   
was due to Mr. Burroughs, after all claims from all   
quarters had been &ldquo;reckoned.&rdquo; The return of the   
marshal, made to the Court, was as follows: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;I have attached the body of George Burroughs he tendered to me, &mdash; for he said he had no pay, &mdash; and taken   
bonds to the value of fourteen pounds money, and read this   
to him.</p>

<p>The bond is as follows. I give the names of the   
signers. The persons who interposed to rescue a persecuted man from unjust imprisonment deserve to be   
held in honored remembrance.</p>

<p>The case was withdrawn, and Burroughs was glad   
to get away. He preferred the Indians at Casco Bay   
to the people here. When we consider, that a committee of the parish petitioned the Court to have such   
a meeting of the inhabitants; that it was held, by an   
order of Court, in compliance with said petition; that   
Burroughs came back to the village to attend it; that   
the meeting agreed, in answer to an inquiry from him   
to that effect, to conform to the order of the Court in   
making it the occasion of a full and final &ldquo;reckoning&rdquo;   
between them; that they spent two days and a half in   
bringing in and sifting all claims on either side; and   
that, when, at the time agreed upon, &mdash; the afternoon   
of the third day, &mdash; the whole body of the inhabitants   
had come together to ratify and give effect to the   
&ldquo;reckoning,&rdquo; the marshal came in with a writ,   
and, evidently in violation of his feelings, was forced   
by John Putnam to arrest Burroughs, thereby breaking up the proceedings asked for by the parish and   
ordered by the Court, for a debt which he did not   
owe, &mdash; it must be allowed, that it was one of the most   
audacious and abominable outrages ever committed.</p>   
<p>The scene presented in these documents is perhaps   
as vivid, and brings the actual life before us as strikingly, as any thing that has come down to us from   
that day. We can see, as though we were looking in   
at the door, the spectacle presented in the old meeting: the farmers gathered from their remote   
and widely scattered plantations, some possibly coming in travelling family-vehicles, &mdash; although it is quite   
<pb n="264" id="vI264"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1309">   
<figDesc>Page 264.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
uncertain whether there were any at that time among   
the farmers; some in companies on farm-carts; many   
on foot; but the greater number on horseback, in their   
picturesque costume of homespun or moose-skin, with   
cowl-shaped hoods, or hats with a brim, narrow in front,   
but broad and slouching behind, hanging over the shoulders. Every man was belted and sworded. They did   
not wear weapons merely for show. There was half a   
score of men in that assembly who were in the Narragansett fight; and some bore on their persons scars   
from that bloody scene of desperate heroism. Every   
man, it is probable, had come to the meeting with   
his firelock on his shoulder, to defend himself and   
companions against Indians lurking in the thick   
woods through which they had to pass. Their countenances bespoke the passions to which they had been   
wrought up by their fierce parish quarrels, &mdash; rugged,   
severe, and earnest. We can see the grim bearing of   
the cavalry lieutenant, John Putnam, and of his elder   
brother and predecessor in commission. Marshal   
Skerry, with his badges of office, is reluctant to execute its functions upon a persecuted and penniless   
minister; but, in accordance with the stern demands   
of the inexorable prosecutors, is faithful still to his   
painful duty. The minister is the central object in the   
picture, &mdash; a small, dark-complexioned man, the amazed   
but calm and patient victim of an animosity in which he   
had no part, and for which he was in no wise responsible. The unresisting dignity of his bearing is quite   
observable. &ldquo;We are now reckoning; we know not   
<pb n="265" id="vI265"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1310">   
<figDesc>Page 265.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
yet who is in debt. I have no pay; but here is my   
body.&rdquo; Perhaps, in that unconspicuous frame, and   
through that humble garb, the sinewy nerves and muscles of steel, the compact and concentrated forces, that   
were the marvel of his times, and finally cost him his   
life, were apparent in his movements and attitudes.   
It may be, that the sufferings and exposures of his previous life had left upon his swarthy features a stamp   
of care and melancholy, foreshadowing the greater   
wrongs and trials in store for him. But the chief figure in the group is the just man who rose and rebuked   
the harsh and reprehensible procedure of the powerful   
landholder, neighbor and friend though he was. The   
manner in which the arbitrary trooper bowed to the   
rebuke, if it does not mitigate our resentment of his   
conduct, illustrates the extraordinary influence of Nathaniel Ingersoll's character, and demonstrates the   
deference in which all men held him.</p>   
<p>There are in this affair other points worthy of notice,   
as showing the effects of their bitter feuds in rendering   
them insensible to every appeal of charity or humanity. Their minds had become so soured, and their   
sense of what was right so impaired, that they neglected and refused to fulfil their most ordinary obligations   
to each other, and to themselves as a society. Rates   
were not collected, and contracts were not complied   
with. The minister and his family were left without   
the necessaries of life. They were compelled to borrow even their clothing, articles of which constituted   
a part of the debt for which he was arrested in such a   
<pb n="266" id="vI266"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1311">   
<figDesc>Page 266.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
public and unfeeling manner. A young woman testifies that she lived with Mr. Burroughs about two   
years, and says: &ldquo;My mistress did tell me that she   
had some serge of John Putnam's wife, to make Mary   
a coat; and also some fustian of his wife, to make my   
mistress a pair of sleeves.&rdquo; The principal items in   
the account were for articles required at the death of   
his wife, by the usages of that day on funeral occasions. Surely it was an outrage upon human nature   
to spring a suit at law and have a writ served on him,   
and take him as a prisoner, on such an occasion, under   
such circumstances, on an alleged debt incurred by   
such a bereavement, when poverty and necessity had   
left him no alternative. The whole procedure receives the stamp, not only of cruelty, but of infamy,   
from the fact, which Nathaniel Ingersoll compelled   
Putnam to acknowledge before the whole congregation, that the account had been settled and the debt   
paid long before.</p>   
<p>John Putnam, although a hard and stern man, had   
many traits of dignity and respectability in his character. That he could have done this thing, in this   
way, proves the extent to which prejudice and passion   
may carry one, particularly where party spirit consumes individual reason and conscience. At this   
point it is well to consider a piece of testimony   
brought against Burroughs nine years afterwards.   
There was no propriety or sense in giving it when it   
was adduced. It was, in truth, an outrage to have   
introduced such testimony in a case where Burroughs   
<pb n="267" id="vI267"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1312">   
<figDesc>Page 267.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was on trial for witchcraft; and it was allowed, only to   
prejudice and mislead the minds of a jury and of the   
public. But it is proper to be taken into view, in   
forming a just estimate, with an impartial aim, of his   
general character. The document is found in a promiscuous bundle of witchcraft papers.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of John Putnam and Rebecca   
his Wife.</hi> &mdash; Testifieth and saith, that, in the year 1680,   
Mr. Burroughs lived in our house nine months. There   
being a great difference betwixt said Burroughs and his   
wife, the difference was so great that they did desire us, the   
deponents, to come into their room to hear their difference.   
The controversy that was betwixt them was, that the aforesaid Burroughs did require his wife to give him a written   
covenant, under her hand and seal, that she would never   
reveal his secrets. Our answer was, that they had once   
made a covenant we did conceive did bind each other to   
keep their lawful secrets. And further saith, that, all the   
time that said Burroughs did live at our house, he was a   
very harsh and sharp man to his wife; notwithstanding,   
to our observation, she was a very good and dutiful wife to   
him.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The first observation that occurs in examining this   
piece of testimony is, that the answer made by Putnam and his wife was excellent, and, like every thing   
from him, shows that he was a man of strong common   
sense, and had a forcible and effectual way of expressing himself. The next thing to be considered is, that   
Mr. Burroughs probably discovered, soon after coming   
to the village, into what a hornests' nest he had got, &mdash;   
<pb n="268" id="vI268"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1313">   
<figDesc>Page 268.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
every one tattling about and backbiting each other.   
His innocent and unsuspicious wife may have indulged   
a little in what is considered the amiable proclivity of   
her sex, and have let fall, in tea-table talk, what cavillers and mischief-makers were on hand to take up;   
and he may have found it both necessary and difficult   
to teach her caution and reserve. He saw, more   
perhaps than she did, the danger of getting involved   
in the personal acrimonies with which the whole community was poisoned. Her unguarded carelessness   
might get herself and him into trouble, and vitally   
impair their happiness and his usefulness. The only   
other point to be remarked upon is the general charge   
against Mr. Burroughs's temper and disposition. It   
may be that he became so disgusted with the state of   
things as to have shown some acerbity in his manners,   
but such a supposition is not in harmony with what   
little is known of him from other sources; and John   
Putnam's conduct at the meeting described proves   
that his mind was fully perverted, and bereft as it   
were of all moral rectitude of judgment, in reference   
to Mr. Burroughs. We must part with Mr. Burroughs   
for the present. We shall meet him again, where the   
powers of malignity will be more shamelessly let loose   
upon him, and prevail to his destruction.</p>   
<p>He was succeeded in the ministry at Salem Village   
by a character of a totally different class. Deodat   
Lawson is first heard of in this country, according to   
Mr. Savage, at Martha's Vineyard in 1671. He took   
the freeman's oath at Boston in 1680, and continued   
<pb n="269" id="vI269"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1314">   
<figDesc>Page 269.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to have his residence there. It was not until after   
much negotiation and considerable importunity, that   
he was prevailed upon to enter into an engagement   
to preach at the Village. He began his ministry   
early in 1684, as appears by the parish record of a   
meeting Feb. 22, 1684: &ldquo;Voted that Joseph Herrick, Jonathan Putnam, and Goodman Cloyse are   
desired to take care for to get a boat for the removing   
of Mr. Lawson's goods.&rdquo; Votes, about this time, were   
passed to repair the parsonage, and the fences around   
the ministry land; thus putting things in readiness to   
receive him. It does not appear that he became particularly entangled in the conflicts which had so long   
disturbed the Village, although, while the mother signified its readiness to approve of his ordination, and some movement was made in the Village   
to that end, it was found impossible to bring the hostile parties sufficiently into co-operation to allow of any   
thing being definitely accomplished. Fortunately for   
Mr. Lawson, the spirit of strife found other objects   
upon which to expend its energies for the time being.   
Some persons brought forward complaints, that the   
records of the parish had not been correctly kept (this   
was before Sergeant Thomas Putnam had been charged   
with that trust); that votes which had passed in   
&ldquo;Mr. Bayley's days&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Mr. Burroughs's days&rdquo;   
had not been truly recorded, or recorded at all; and   
that what had never been passed had been entered as   
votes. A great agitation arose on this subject, and   
many meetings were held. Some demanded that the   
<pb n="270" id="vI270"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1315">   
<figDesc>Page 270.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
spurious votes should be expunged; others, that the   
omitted votes should be inserted. Then there was an   
excited disputation about the ministry lands, and the   
validity or sufficiency of their title to them. Joseph   
Houlton had given them; but he had nothing to do   
with raising the question, and did all he could to suppress it. Some person had discovered that William   
Haynes, to whom Houlton had succeeded by the right   
of his wife, had omitted to get his deed of purchase   
recorded, and the original could not be found. Disputes also arose about the use of the grounds around   
the meeting-house. These, added to the conflicts with   
the &ldquo;Topsfield men,&rdquo; and matters not fully adjusted   
with the town of Salem, created and kept up a violent   
fermentation, in which all were miscellaneously involved. In the midst of this confusion, the matter of   
ordaining Mr. Lawson was put into the warrant for a   
meeting to be held on the 10th of December, 1686.   
But it was found impossible to recall the people from   
their divisions, and no favorable action could be had.</p>   
<p>At length, all attempts to settle their difficulties   
among themselves were abandoned; and they called   
for help from outside. At a legally warned meeting   
on the 17th of January, 1687, the inhabitants made   
choice of &ldquo;Captain John Putnam&rdquo; (he had been promoted in the military line since the affair in the   
meeting-house with Mr. Burroughs), &ldquo;Lieutenant   
Jonathan Walcot, Ensign Thomas Flint, and Corporal   
Joseph Herrick, for to transact with Joseph Hutchinson, Job Swinnerton, Joseph Porter, and Daniel Andrew   
<pb n="271" id="vI271"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1316">   
<figDesc>Page 271.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
about their grievances relating to the public   
affairs of this place; and, if they cannot agree among   
themselves, that then they shall refer their differences to   
the Honored Major Gedney and John Hathorne, Esqs.,   
and to the reverend elders of the Salem Church, for a   
full determination of those differences.&rdquo; Of course, it   
was impossible to settle the matter among themselves,   
and the referees were called in. William Brown, Jr.,   
Esq., was added to them. They were all of the old   
town, and men of the highest consideration. Their   
judgment in the case is a well-drawn and interesting   
document, and shows the view which near neighbors   
took of the distractions in the village. The following   
passage will exhibit the purport and spirit of it: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Loving Brethren, Friends and Neighbors,</hi> &mdash; Upon serious consideration of, and mature deliberation upon, what   
hath been offered to us about your calling and transacting   
in order to the settling and ordaining the Rev. Mr. Deodat   
Lawson, and the grievances offered by some to obstruct and   
impede that proceeding, our sense of the matter is this, &mdash;   
first, that the affair of calling and transacting in order to   
the settling and ordaining the Reverend Mr. Lawson hath   
not been so inoffensively managed as might have been, &mdash; at   
least, not in all the parts and passages of it; second, that   
the grievances offered by some amongst you are not in themselves of sufficient weight to obstruct so great a work, and   
that they have not been improved so peaceably and orderly   
as Christian prudence and self-denial doth direct; third, to   
our grief, we observe such uncharitable expressions and uncomely reflections tossed to and fro as look like the effects   
<pb n="272" id="vI272"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1317">   
<figDesc>Page 272.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of settled prejudice and resolved animosity, though we are   
much rather willing to account them the product of weakness than wilfulness: however, we must needs say, that,   
come whence they will, they have a tendency to make such   
a gap as we fear, if not timely prevented, will let out peace   
and order, and let in confusion and every evil work.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>They then proceed to give some good advice to   
&ldquo;prevent contention and trouble for the future, that   
it may not devour for ever, and that, if the Lord   
please, you may be happier henceforth than to make   
one another miserable; and not make your place uncomfortable to your present, and undesirable to any   
other, minister, and the ministry itself in a great   
measure unprofitable: and that you may not bring   
impositions on yourselves by convincing all about you   
that you cannot, or will not, use your liberty as becomes the gospel.&rdquo; Their advice is, &ldquo;that you desist,   
at present, from urging the ordination of the Rev. Mr.   
Lawson, till your spirits are better quieted and composed.&rdquo; They give some judicious suggestions about   
various matters that had been the occasion of difficulty   
among them, especially to help them get their records   
put into good shape, and kept so for the future;   
and wind up in the following excellent, and in some   
of the clauses rather emphatic and pithy, expressions: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Finally, we think peace cheap, if it may be procured by   
complying with the aforementioned particulars, which are   
few, fair, and easy; and that they will hardly pass for lovers   
of peace, truth, ministry, and order, in the day of the Lord,   
<pb n="273" id="vI273"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1318">   
<figDesc>Page 273.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that shall so lean to their own understanding and will that   
they shall refuse such easy methods for the obtaining of   
them. And, if peace and agreement amongst you be once   
comfortably obtained, we advise you with all convenient   
speed to go on with your intended ordination; and so we   
shall follow our advice with our prayers. But, if our   
advice be rejected, we wish you better, and hearts to follow   
it; and only add, if you will unreasonably trouble yourselves, we pray you not any further to trouble us. We leave   
all to the blessing of God, the wonderful Counsellor, and   
your own serious consideration: praying you to read and   
consider the whole, and then act as God shall direct you.   
Farewell.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>[Salem, Feb. 14, 1687. Signed by the five referees, &mdash;   
John Higginson and Nicholas Noyes (the elders of the old   
church), and the three gentlemen before named.]</p>   
<p>At a meeting of the inhabitants of the Village on   
the 18th of February, it was voted that &ldquo;we do accept   
of and embrace the advice of the honored and reverend   
gentlemen of Salem, sent to us under their hands, and   
order that it shall be entered on our book of records.&rdquo;   
But they took care further to vote, that they accepted   
it &ldquo;in general, and not in parts.&rdquo; In accordance with   
the advice of the referees, they brought up, considered   
anew, and put to question, every entry in their past   
records about the genuineness and validity of which   
any division of opinion existed. Some entries that   
had been complained of and given offence as incorrect   
were voted out, and others were confirmed by being   
adopted on a new vote. A new book of records was   
<pb n="274" id="vI274"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1319">   
<figDesc>Page 274.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
prepared, to conform to these decisions, which, having   
been submitted for examination to leading persons,   
appointed for the purpose at a legal meeting representing both parties, and approved by them, was   
adopted and sanctioned at a subsequent meeting also   
called for the purpose.</p>   
<p>In accordance with the same advice &ldquo;that the old   
book of records be kept in being,&rdquo; it was ordered by   
the meeting to leave the votes that had, by the foregoing proceedings, been rendered null and void, to   
&ldquo;lie in the old book of records as they are.&rdquo; From   
the new book of records we learn that &ldquo;some votes   
are left out that passed in Mr. Bayley's days, and some   
that passed in Mr. Burroughs's days,&rdquo; particularly all   
the votes but one that passed at a meeting held on the   
fifth day of June, 1683, the very time that Mr. Burroughs was under bonds in the action of debt brought   
by John Putnam. The new record specifies some few,   
but not all, of the votes that were rescinded because   
it was adjudged that they had not rightfully passed, or   
been correctly stated. Unfortunately, the old book,   
after all, has not been &ldquo;kept in being;&rdquo; and much   
that would have exhibited more fully and clearly the   
unhappy early history of the parish is for ever lost.   
If the records that have been suffered to remain present the picture I have endeavored faithfully to draw,   
how much darker might have been its shades had we   
been permitted to behold what the parties concerned   
concurred in thinking too bad to be left to view!</p>   
<p>The attempt to expunge records is always indefensible,   
<pb n="275" id="vI275"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1320">   
<figDesc>Page 275.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
besides being in itself irrational and absurd. It   
may cover up the details of wrong and folly; but it   
leaves an unlimited range to the most unfriendly conjecture. We are compelled to imagine what we ought   
to be allowed to know; and, in many particulars, our   
fancies may be worse than the facts. But later times,   
and public bodies of greater pretensions than &ldquo;the   
inhabitants of Salem Village,&rdquo; have attempted, and   
succeeded in perpetrating, this outrage upon history.   
In trying to conceal their errors, men have sometimes   
destroyed the means of their vindication. This may   
be the case with the story that is to be told of &ldquo;Salem   
Witchcraft.&rdquo; It has been the case in reference to   
wider fields of history. The Parliamentary journals   
and other public records of the period of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate were suppressed by   
the infatuated stupidity of the Government of the   
Restoration. They foolishly imagined that they were   
hiding the shame, while they were obscuring the glory,   
of their country. Every Englishman, every intelligent man, now knows, that, during that very period,   
all that has made England great was done. The seeds   
of her naval and maritime prosperity were planted:   
and she was pushed at once by wise measures of policy, internal and external; by legislation developing   
her resources and invigorating the power of her people; by a decisive and comprehensive diplomacy that   
commanded the respect of foreign courts, and secured   
to her a controlling influence upon the traffic of the   
world; by developments of her military genius under   
<pb n="276" id="vI276"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1321">   
<figDesc>Page 276.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the greatest of all the great generals of modern times;   
and by naval achievements that snatched into her   
hands the balancing trident of the seas, &mdash; to the place   
she still holds (how much longer she may hold it remains to be seen) as the leading power of the world.   
If she has to relinquish that position, it will only be   
to a power that is true to the spirit, and is not ashamed   
of the name, of a republic. The nation that fully   
develops the policy which pervaded the records of the   
English Commonwealth will be the leader of the world.   
The suppression of those records has not suppressed   
the spirit of popular liberty, or the progress of mankind in the path of reform, freedom, equal rights, and   
a true civilization. It has only cast a shadow, which   
can never wholly be dispelled, over what otherwise   
would have been the brightest page in the annals of a   
great people. We depend for our knowledge of the   
steps by which England then made a most wonderful   
stride to prosperity and power, not upon official and   
authoritative records, but upon the desultory and   
sometimes merely gossiping memoirs of particular   
persons, and such other miscellaneous materials as   
can be picked up. The only consequence of an attempt to extinguish the memory of republicans, radicals, reformers, and regicides has been, that the history   
of England's true glory can never be adequately   
written.</p>   
<p>The referees used the following language touching   
the point of the ordination of Mr. Lawson: &ldquo;If more   
than a mere major part should not consent to it, we   
<pb n="277" id="vI277"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1322">   
<figDesc>Page 277.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
should be loath to advise our brethren to proceed.&rdquo;   
This, in connection with the other sentence I have   
quoted from their communication recommending them   
&ldquo;to desist at present&rdquo; from urging it, was fatal to the   
immediate movement in his favor; and, not seeing   
any prospect of their &ldquo;spirits becoming better quieted   
and composed,&rdquo; and weary of the attempt to bring   
them to any comfortable degree of unanimity, Mr.   
Lawson threw up his connection with them, and removed back to Boston. We shall meet him again; but   
it is well to despatch at this point what is to be said of   
his character and history.</p>   
<p>It is evident that Deodat Lawson had received the   
best education of his day. It is not easy to account   
for his not having left a more distinguished mark in   
Old or New England. He had much learning and   
great talents. Of his power in getting up pulpit performances in the highest style of eloquence, of which   
that period afforded remarkable specimens, I shall   
have occasion to speak. Among his other attainments, he was, what cannot be said of learned and   
professional men generally now any more than then,   
an admirable penman. The village parish adopted the   
practice at the beginning, when paying the salaries of   
its ministers from time to time, instead of taking receipts on detached and loose pieces of paper, of having   
them write them out in their own hand on the pages   
of the record-book, with their signatures. It is a luxury, in looking over the old volume, to come upon the   
receipts of Deodat Lawson, in his plain, round hand.

A specimen is given among the autographs. His chirography is easy, free, graceful, clear, and clean. It   
unites with wonderful taste the highest degrees of simplicity and ornament. Each style is used, and both   
are blended, as occasion required. During his ministry, the trouble about the old record-book occurred.   
The first four pages of the new book are in his handwriting. The ink has somewhat faded; the paper has   
become discolored, and, around the margins and at the   
bottom of the leaves, lamentably worn and broken.   
The first page exhibits Lawson's penmanship in its   
various styles. It is artistically executed in several   
sizes of letters, appropriate to the position of the   
clauses and the import and weight of the matter. In   
each there is an elegant combination of ornament and   
simplicity. His chirography was often had in requisition; and papers, evidently from his pen, are on file in   
various cases, occurring in court at the time, in which   
his friends were interested.</p>

<p>The first four ministers of the village parish were   
excellent penmen. Bayley's hand is more like the   
modern style than the rest. Burroughs's is as legible   
as print, uniform in its character, open and upright.   
The specimen among the autographs is from the record referred to at the top of page 262. As it was   
written at the bottom of a page in the record-book,   
where there was hardly sufficient room, it had to be in   
a slanting line. I give it just as it there appears.   
Parris wrote three different hands, all perfectly easy   
to read. The larger kind was used when signing his

name to important papers, or in brief entries of record.   
The specimen I give is from a receipt in the parish, which Thomas Putnam, as clerk, made oath in   
court, that Parris wrote and signed in his presence.   
His notes of examinations of persons charged with   
witchcraft by the committing magistrate, many of   
which are preserved, are in his smallest hand, very   
minute, but always legible. In his church-records he   
uses sometimes a medium hand, and sometimes the   
smallest. The autographs of Townsend Bishop and   
Thomas Putnam show the handwriting that seems to   
have prevailed among well-educated people in England   
at the time of the first settlement of this country.   
There was often a profusion of flourishes that obscured   
the letters. The initial capitals were quite complicated   
and very curious. The signature of Thomas Putnam,   
Jr., exhibits his excellent handwriting.</p>   
<p>I have adduced these facts and given these illustrations to show, that, in this branch of education, &mdash; the   
value and desirableness of which cannot be overrated,   
&mdash; it is at least an open question, whether we have   
much ground to boast of being in advance of the first   
generations of our ancestors in America. The early   
ministers of the Salem Village parish certainly compare, in this particular, favorably with ministers and   
professional men, and recording officers generally in   
public bodies of all kinds, in later times.</p>   
<p>Sergeant Thomas Putnam did not act as clerk of   
the parish from April, 1687, to April, 1694. A few   
entries are made by his hand; but the record, very   
<pb n="282" id="vI282"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1327">   
<figDesc>Page 282.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
meagre and fragmentary, is for the most part made   
by others. This is much to be regretted, as the   
interval covers the very period of our history. His   
time, probably, was taken up, and his mind wholly   
engrossed, by an unhappy family difficulty, in which,   
during that period, he was involved. Thomas Putnam Sr. died, as has been stated, in 1686. It was   
thought, by the children of his first wife, that the   
influence of the second wife had been unduly exercised   
over him, in his last years, so as to induce him to   
make a will giving to her, and her only child by him,   
Joseph, a very unfair proportion of his estate. It was   
felt by them to be so unjust that they attempted to   
break the will. The management of the case was confided to Sergeant Thomas Putnam, as the eldest son of   
the family; and the affair, it may be supposed, absorbed   
his thoughts to such a degree as to render it necessary   
for him to abandon his services as clerk of the parish.   
The attempt to set aside the will failed. The circumstances connected with the subject disturbed very seriously &mdash; perhaps permanently &mdash; the happiness of the   
whole family, and may have contributed to create   
the morbid excitement which afterwards was so fearfully displayed by the wife of the younger Thomas.</p>   
<p>While Mr. Lawson was at the village, he lost his   
wife and daughter. In 1690, he was again married, to   
Deborah Allen. He was settled afterwards over the   
Second Society in Scituate, &mdash; it is singular that our   
local histories do not tell us when, but that we get all   
we know on the point from a sentence written by the   
<pb n="283" id="vI283"/>

<figDesc>Page 283.</figDesc>

pen on a leaf of one of the two folio volumes of John   
Quick's &ldquo;Synodicon in Gallia Reformata,&rdquo; in the possession of a gentleman in this country, Henry M.   
Dexter, who says it is evidently Quick's autograph.   
It is in these words: &ldquo;For my reverend and dear   
brother, Mr. Lawson, minister of the gospel, and pastor of the church of Scituate, in the province of Massachusetts in New England; from the publisher, John   
Quick, <hi rend="italics">honoris et amoris ergo,</hi> Aug. 6, 1693.&rdquo; In 1696,   
Mr. Lawson went over to England, merely for a short   
visit, as his people supposed. They heard from him   
no more. He never asked a dismission, or communicated with them in any way. In 1698, an ecclesiastical council declared them free to settle another   
minister, which they did in due time. He was, no   
doubt, alive and in London when, in 1704, his famous   
Salem Village sermon was reprinted there. But this   
is the last glimpse we have of him. An inscrutable   
mystery covers the rest of his history. His manner of leaving the Scituate parish shows him to have   
been an eccentric person, leaves an unfavorable impression of his character, and is as inexplicable as   
the only other reference to him that has thus far   
been found. Calamy, in his &ldquo;Continuation of the   
Account of Ejected Ministers,&rdquo; published in 1727, has   
a notice of Thomas Lawson, whom he describes as   
minister of Denton in the country of Norfolk, educated at Katherine Hall in Cambridge, and afterwards   
chosen &ldquo;to a fellowship in St. John's. He was a man   
of parts, but had no good utterance. He was the   
<pb n="284" id="vI284"/>

<figDesc>Page 284.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
father of the unhappy Mr. Deodat Lawson, who came   
hither from New England.&rdquo; With all his abilities,   
learning, and eloquence, he disappears, after the republication of his Salem Village sermon in London,   
in the dark, impenetrable cloud of this expression,   
&ldquo;the unhappy Mr. Deodat Lawson.&rdquo; Of the melancholy fate implied in the language of Calamy, I have   
not been able to obtain the slightest information.</p>   
<p>The troubles that covered the whole period, since   
the beginning of Mr. Bayley's ministry, had led to the   
neglect and derangement of the entire organization of   
the Village, and resulted in the loss of what little   
opportunities for education might otherwise have been   
provided. So great was this evil regarded, that the   
old town felt it necessary to interpose; and we find it   
voted Jan. 24, 1682, that &ldquo;Lieutenant John Putnam   
is desired, and is hereby empowered, to take care that   
the law relating to the catechising of children and   
youth be duly attended at the Village.&rdquo; He is also   
&ldquo;desired to have a diligent care that all the families   
do carefully and constantly attend the due education   
of their children and youth according to law.&rdquo; We   
cannot but feel that the man who was ready to fight   
the &ldquo;Topsfield men&rdquo; in the woods &mdash; who, when they   
asked him, &ldquo;What, by violence?&rdquo; answered, with axe   
in hand, &ldquo;Ay, by violence,&rdquo; and who figured in the   
manner described in the scene with Mr. Burroughs &mdash;   
was a singular person to intrust with the charge of   
&ldquo;catechising the children and youth.&rdquo; But those   
were queer times, and he was a queer character. He   
<pb n="285" id="vI285"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1330">   
<figDesc>Page 285.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
had always been a church-member; and, to the day of   
his death, church and prayer meetings were more frequently held at his house than in any other. He was   
a rough man, but he was no hypocrite. He was in   
the front of every encounter; but he was tolerant, too,   
of difference of opinion. When, at one time, the contests of the Village were at their height, and two committees were raised representing the two conflicting   
parties, he was at the head of one, and his eldest son   
(Jonathan) of the other. Their opposition does not   
seem to have alienated them. While I have found it   
necessary to hold him up, in some of his actions, for   
condemnation, there were many good points about   
him; although he was not the sort of man that would   
be likely, in our times, to be selected to execute the   
functions of a Sunday-school teacher.</p>   
<p>During all this period, there was a variety of minor   
controversies among themselves, causing greater or   
less disturbance. Joseph Hutchinson, who had given   
a site out of his homestead-grounds for the meeting, had no patience with their perpetual wranglings. He fenced up his lands around the meeting lot, leaving them an entrance on the end towards the road. They went to court about it, and   
he was called to account by the usual process of law.   
The plain, gruff old farmer, who seems all along to   
have been a man of strong sense and decided character, filed an answer, which is unsurpassed for bluntness of expression. It has no language of ceremony,   
but goes to the point at once. It has a general interest   
<pb n="286" id="vI286"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1331">   
<figDesc>Page 286.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
as showing, to how late a period the inhabitants of   
this neighborhood were exposed to Indian attacks, and   
what means of defence were resorted to by the Village   
worshippers. The document manifests the contempt   
in which he held the complainants, and it was all the   
satisfaction they got.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Joseph Hutchinson his answer is as followeth:&mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;First, as to the covenant they spoke of, I conceive it is   
neither known of by me nor them, as will appear by records   
from the farmer's book.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Second, I conceive they have no cause to complain of   
me for fencing in my own land; for I am sure I fenced in   
none of theirs. I wish they would not pull down my fences.   
I am loath to complain, though I have just cause.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Third, for blocking up the meeting-house, it was they   
did it, and not I, in the time of the Indian wars; and   
they made Salem pay for it. I wish they would bring me   
my rocks they took to do it with; for I want them to make   
fence with.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Thus, hoping this honored Court will see that there was   
no just cause to complain against me, and their cause will   
appear unjust in that they would in an unjust way take   
away my land, I trust I shall have relief; so I rest, your   
Honor's servant, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Hutchinson.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>[Nov. 27, 1686.]</p>   
<p>The next minister of Salem Village brought matters   
to a crisis. Samuel Parris is stated to have been a   
son of Thomas Parris, of London, and was born in   
1653. He was, for a time, a member of Harvard College, but did not finish the academic course, being   
<pb n="287" id="vI287"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1332">   
<figDesc>Page 287.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
drawn to a commercial life. He was engaged in the   
West-India business, and probably lived at Barbadoes.   
After a while, he abandoned commerce, and prepared   
himself for the ministry. There was at this time,   
and long subsequently, a very particular mercantile connection between Salem and Barbadoes. The   
former husband of the wife of Thomas Putnam, Sr., &mdash;   
Nathaniel Veren, &mdash; as has been stated, had property   
in that island, and was more or less acquainted with   
its people. Perhaps it was through this channel that   
the thoughts of the people of the Village were turned   
towards Mr. Parris. From a deposition made by him   
a few years afterwards in a suit at law between   
him and his parishioners, we learn some interesting   
facts relating to the negotiations that led to his settlement.</p>   
<p>It appears from his statement that a committee,   
consisting of &ldquo;Captain John Putnam, Mr. Joshua Rea,   
Sr., and Francis Nurse,&rdquo; was appointed, on the 15th   
of November, 1688, to treat with him &ldquo;about taking   
ministerial office.&rdquo; On the 25th of November, &ldquo;after   
the services in the afternoon, the audience was stayed,   
and, by a general vote, requested Mr. Parris to take   
office.&rdquo; He hung back for a while, and exercised the   
skill and adroitness acquired in his mercantile life in   
making as sharp a bargain as he could.</p>   
<p>At that time, there appeared to be a degree of harmony among the people, such as they had never known   
before. There was a disposition on all sides to come   
together, and avail themselves of the occasion of   
<pb n="288" id="vI288"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1333">   
<figDesc>Page 288.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
settling a new minister, to bury their past animosities,   
and forget their grievances; and there is every reason   
to believe, if Mr. Parris had promptly closed with their   
terms, he might have enjoyed a peaceful ministry, and   
a happy oblivion have covered for ever his name and the   
history of the village. But he withheld response to   
the call. The people were impatient, and felt that the   
golden opportunity might be lost, and the old feuds   
revive. On the 10th of December, another committee   
was raised, consisting of Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam, Sergeant Fuller, Mr. Joshua Rea, Sr., and Sergeant Ingersoll, as &ldquo;messengers, to know whether Mr.   
Parris would accept of office.&rdquo; His answer was, &ldquo;the   
work was weighty; they should know in due time.&rdquo;   
They were thus kept in suspense during the whole   
winter, getting no reply from him. On the 29th of   
April, 1689, &ldquo;Deacons Nathaniel Ingersoll and Edward   
Putnam, Daniel Rea, Thomas Fuller, Jr., and John Tarbell, came to Mr. Parris from the meeting-house,&rdquo; where   
there had been a general meeting of the inhabitants,   
and said, &ldquo;Being the aged men had had the matter   
of Mr. Parris's settlement so long in hand, and effected   
nothing, they were desirous to try what the younger   
could do.&rdquo; Deacon Ingersoll was about fifty-five years   
of age; but his spirit and character kept him in sympathy with the progressive impulses of younger men.   
Deacon Putnam was thirty-four years of age. Daniel   
Rea was the son of Joshua; Thomas Fuller, Jr., the   
son of Sergeant Fuller; and John Tarbell, the son of Francis Nurse.</p>

<figDesc>Page 289.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>This is the first appearance, I believe, in our history,   
of that notorious and most pretentious personage who   
has figured so largely in all our affairs ever since,   
&ldquo;Young America.&rdquo; The sequel shows, that, in this   
instance at least, no benefit arose from discarding the   
caution and experience of years. The &ldquo;younger   
men&rdquo; were determined to &ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo; They said   
they were desirous of a speedy answer. Finding them   
in a temper to &ldquo;finish the thing up,&rdquo; at any rate, and   
seeing that they were ambitious to get the credit of   
&ldquo;effecting something,&rdquo; and, for that end, predisposed to   
come to his terms, he disclosed them. They had offered   
him a salary of sixty pounds per annum, &mdash; one third in   
money, the rest in provisions, at certain specified rates.   
He agreed to accept the call on the foregoing terms,   
with certain additional conditions thus described by   
himself: &ldquo;First, when money shall be more plenteous,   
the money part to be paid me shall accordingly be increased. Second, though corn or like provisions   
should arise to a higher price than you have set, yet,   
for my own family use, I shall have what is needful at   
the price now stated, and so if it fall lower. Third,   
the whole sixty pounds to be only from our inhabitants   
that are dwelling in our bounds, proportionable to   
what lands they have within the same. Fourth, no   
provision to be brought in without first asking whether   
needed, and myself to make choice of what, unless the   
person is unable to pay in any sort but one. Fifth,   
firewood to be given in yearly, freely. Sixth, two men   
to be chosen yearly to see that due payments be made.   
<pb n="290" id="vI290"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1335">   
<figDesc>Page 290.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Seventh, contributions each sabbath in papers; and only   
such as are in papers, and dwelling within our bounds,   
to be accounted a part of the sixty pounds. Eighth, as   
God shall please to bless the place so as to be able to   
rise higher than the sixty pounds, that then a proportionable increase be made. If God shall please, for our   
sins, to diminish the substance of said place, I will   
endeavor accordingly to bear such losses, by proportionable abatements of such as shall reasonably desire it.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>A contribution-box was either handed around by the   
deacons, before the congregation was dismissed, or   
attached permanently near the porch or door. Rate would inclose their money in papers, with their   
names, and drop them in. When the box was opened,   
the sums inclosed would be entered to their credit on   
the rate-schedule. There was always a considerable   
number of stated worshippers in the congregation   
who lived without the bounds of the village, and often   
transient visitors or strangers happened to be at meeting. It was a point that had not been determined,   
whether moneys collected from the above descriptions   
of persons should go into the general treasury of the   
parish, to be used in meeting their contract to pay the   
minister's salary, or be kept as a separate surplus.</p>   
<p>The terms, as thus described by Mr. Parris, show that   
he had profited by his experience in trade, and knew   
how to make a shrewd bargain. It was quite certain   
that a farming community in a new country, with   
fields continually reclaimed from the wilderness and   
<pb n="291" id="vI291"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1336">   
<figDesc>Page 291.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
added to culture, would increase in substance: if so,   
his annual stipend would increase. If the place should   
decline, he was to abate the tax of individuals, if desired by them personally, so far as he should judge   
their petition to that effect reasonable. If &ldquo;strangers'   
money,&rdquo; or contributions from &ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo; were not   
to go to make up his sixty pounds, it was quite probable that it would come into his pocket as an extra   
allowance, or perquisite.</p>   
<p>He says that the committee accepted these terms,   
and agreed to them, expressing their belief that the people also would. No record appears on the parish-books   
of the appointment of this committee of the &ldquo;younger   
men,&rdquo; or of the action of the society on their report,   
or of any report having been made at that time. In   
the mean while, Mr. Parris continued to preach and   
act as the minister of the society until his ordination,   
near the close of the year. There was a meeting on   
the 21st of May; but the record consists of but a single   
entry, &mdash; the appointment of a committee &ldquo;as overseers for the year ensuing, to take care of our meeting and other public charges, and to make return   
according to law.&rdquo; The next entry is of a general   
meeting of the inhabitants, on the 18th of June, 1689.   
The choice of the regular standing committee for the   
year is recorded. Immediately following this entry,   
are these words: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;At the same meeting, &mdash; the 18th of June, 1689, &mdash; it   
was agreed and voted by general concurrence, that, for Mr.   
Parris, his encouragement and settlement in the work of the   
<pb n="292" id="vI292"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1337">   
<figDesc>Page 292.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
ministry amongst us, we will give him sixty six pounds for his   
yearly salary, &mdash; one-third paid in money, the other two-third   
parts for provisions, &amp;c.; and Mr. Parris to find himself   
firewood, and Mr. Parris to keep the ministry-house in good   
repair; and that Mr. Parris shall also have the use of the   
ministry-pasture, and the inhabitants to keep the fence in   
repair; and that we will keep up our contributions, and our   
inhabitants to put their money in papers, and this to continue   
so long as Mr. Parris continues in the work of the ministry   
amongst us, and all productions to be good and merchantable.   
And, if it please God to bless the inhabitants, we shall be   
willing to give more; and to expect, that if God shall diminish the estates of the people, that then Mr. Parris do   
abate of his salary according to proportion.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Comparing this record with the account given by   
Mr. Parris of the eight conditions upon which   
he agreed, in conference with the committee of the   
&ldquo;younger&rdquo; sort, on the 29th of April, to accept the   
call of the parish, the difference is not very essential. The matter of firewood was arranged, according   
to his account, by mutual agreement, they to add six   
pounds to his salary, and he to find his own wood.   
The rates of &ldquo;the inhabitants&rdquo; were to be paid &ldquo;in   
papers.&rdquo; The only point of difference, touching this   
matter, is that the record is silent about contributions   
by outsiders and strangers; whereas he says it was   
agreed, on the 29th of April, that they should not   
go towards making up his salary. The idea of his   
salary rising with the growth and sinking with the   
decline of the society is expressed in the record   
<pb n="293" id="vI293"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1338">   
<figDesc>Page 293.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
substantially as it is by him, only it is made exact;   
and, in case of a decline in the means of the people,   
a corresponding decline is to be in the aggregate   
of his salary, and not by abatements made by him in   
individual cases. The variations are nearly, if not   
quite, all unimportant in their nature, and such as a   
regard to mutual convenience would suggest. Yet   
there was something in the above record which highly   
exasperated Mr. Parris.</p>   
<p>In his deposition he states, that, at a meeting held   
on the 17th of May, of which there is no record in the   
parish book, he was sent for and was present. He   
says that there was &ldquo;much agitation&rdquo; at the meeting.   
He says that objection was made by the people to two   
of his &ldquo;eight&rdquo; conditions, the fifth and seventh. But   
there is nothing in the record of the 18th of June in   
conflict with what he says was finally agreed upon,   
except the disposition that should be made of &ldquo;strangers money.&rdquo; The question then recurs, What was   
the cause of the &ldquo;much agitation&rdquo; at that meeting?   
What was it in the language of that record which   
always so excited Mr. Parris's wrath?</p>   
<p>I am inclined to think that the offensive words were   
those which require &ldquo;Mr. Parris to keep the ministry   
house in good repair,&rdquo; and that he &ldquo;shall also have   
the use of the ministry pasture;&rdquo; and this was not   
objectionable as involving any expense upon him, but   
solely because the language employed precluded the   
supposition that the parish had countenanced the idea   
of ever conveying the parsonage and parsonage lands   
<pb n="294" id="vI294"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1339">   
<figDesc>Page 294.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to him in his own right and absolutely. This was an   
object which he evidently had in view from the first,   
and to which he clung to the last. It is to be feared,   
that some of the members of the &ldquo;Young-America&rdquo;   
committee, in their heedless and inconsiderate eagerness to &ldquo;effect&rdquo; something, to settle Mr. Parris forthwith, and thereby prove how much more competent   
they were than &ldquo;the aged men&rdquo; to transact a weighty   
business, had encouraged Mr. Parris to think that his   
favorite object could be accomplished. Upon a little   
inquiry, however, they discovered that it could not be   
done; but that the house and land were secured by   
the original deeds of conveyance, and by irreversible   
agreements and conditions, to the use of the ministry,   
for the time being and for ever. So far as the committee   
or any of its members had favored this idea in their   
conference with Mr. Parris, they had taken a position   
from which they had to retreat. They had compromised   
themselves and the parish. For this reason, perhaps,   
they made no report; and no mention of their agency   
appears on the records. How far Deacon Ingersoll   
was misled by his younger associates on this occasion, I   
know not; but he was not a man to break a promise   
if he could keep it, no matter how much to his own loss.   
He recognized his responsibility as chairman of the   
unfortunate committee, and retrieved the mistake they   
had made, by giving to Mr. Parris, by deed, a lot of   
land adjoining the parsonage property, and in value   
equal to the whole of it. The date of that conveyance,   
immediately after Mr. Parris's ordination, corroborates   
<pb n="295" id="vI295"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1340">   
<figDesc>Page 295.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the conjecture that it was made to compensate Mr.   
Parris for the failure of his expectation to get possession   
of the ministry property. It ought to have been received   
by him as an equivalent, and have soothed his angry   
disappointment; but it did not. He had indulged the   
belief, that he had effected a bargain with the parish, at   
his settlement, which had made him the owner, in fee   
simple, of the parish property; and when he found that   
the record of the terms of his settlement, in the parish, absolutely precluded that idea, his exasperation   
was great, and no reparation Deacon Ingersoll or any   
one else could make was suffered to appease it. The   
following deposition, made in court some years afterwards, gives an account of a scene in the meeting after Parris's ordination: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Ipswich Court,</hi> 1697. &mdash; Parris <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> Inhabitants of Salem   
Village.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;We the undersigned testify and say, that, a considerable   
time after Mr. Parris his ordination, there was a meeting of   
the inhabitants of Salem Village at the usual place of meeting; and the occasion of the meeting was concerning Mr.   
Parris, and several persons were at that meeting, that had   
not, before this meeting, joined with the people in calling   
or agreeing with Mr. Parris; and the said persons desired   
that those things that concerned Mr. Parris and the people   
might be read, and accordingly it was. And the entry, that   
some call a salary, being read, there arose a difference   
among the people, the occasion of which was finding an   
entry in the book of the Village records, relating to Mr.   
Parris his maintenance, which was dated the 18th of June,   
<pb n="296" id="vI296"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1341">   
<figDesc>Page 296.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
1689; and, the entry being read to the people, some replied   
that they believed that Mr. Parris would not comply with   
that entry; whereupon one said it was best to send for Mr.   
Parris to resolve the question. Accordingly, he was sent for.   
He coming to the people, this entry of the 18th of June,   
1689, was read to Mr. Parris. His answer was as follows:   
`He never heard or knew any thing of it, neither could or   
would he take up with it, or any part of it;' and further   
he said, `They were knaves and cheaters that entered it.'   
And Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam, being moderator of that   
meeting, replied to Mr. Parris, and said, `Sir, then there is   
only proposals on both sides, and no agreement between you   
and the people.' And Mr. Parris answered and said, `No   
more, there is not; for I am free from the people, and the   
people free from me:' and so the meeting broke up. And   
we further testify, that there hath not been any agreement   
made with Mr. Parris, that we knew of or ever heard of, &mdash;   
never since.</p>   
<p rend="right">&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Porter.</hi></p>   
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel Andrew.</hi></p>   
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Putnam.</hi></p>   
<p rend="center">&ldquo;Sworn in Court, at Ipswich, April 13, 1697, by all three.   
Attest, <hi rend="smallcaps">Stephen Sewall,</hi> <hi rend="italics">Clerk.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The answer which Mr. Parris made to Nathaniel   
Putnam's inquiry probably settled the question in the   
suit then pending, and led to the final release of the   
parish from him. It is hard to find any point of difference between his own account of the conditions he   
himself made, and the record of the parish-book, of   
sufficient importance to account for the storm of passion   
<pb n="297" id="vI297"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1342">   
<figDesc>Page 297.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
into which the reading of the latter drove him, except   
in the language which I have suggested as the probable   
occasion of his wrath. Unfortunately for him, there is   
evidence quite corroborative of this suggestion.</p>   
<p>The parish-book has the following record:&mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;At a general meeting of the inhabitants of Salem Village, Oct. 10, 1689, it was agreed and voted, that the vote,   
in our book of record of 1681, that lays, as some say, an   
entailment upon our ministry house and land, is hereby made   
void and of no effect; one man only dissenting.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;It was voted and agreed by a general concurrence, that   
we will give to Mr. Parris our ministry house and barn, and   
two acres of land next adjoining to the house; and that Mr.   
Parris take office amongst us, and live and die in the work   
of the ministry among us; and, if Mr. Parris or his heirs   
do sell the house and land, that the people may have the first   
refusal of it, by giving as much as other men will. A committee was chosen to lay out the land, and make a conveyance   
of the house and land, and to make the conveyance in the   
name and in the behalf of the inhabitants unto Mr. Parris   
and his heirs.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The record of these votes is not signed by the clerk,   
and there is no evidence that the meeting was legally   
warned. It does not appear in whose custody the   
book then was. But, however the entry got in, it proves   
that Parris's friends were determined to gratify his all   
but insane purpose to get possession of what he ought   
to have known it was impossible for the parish to give,   
or for him or his heirs to hold. It was indeed a miserable commencement of his ministry, to introduce such   
<pb n="298" id="vI298"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1343">   
<figDesc>Page 298.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
a strife with a people who really seem to have had an   
earnest desire to receive him with united hearts, and   
make his settlement and ministry the harbinger of a   
better day. But he alienated many of them, at the very   
start, by his sharp practice in negotiating about the   
pecuniary details of his agreement with the parish.   
When, after all their care to prevent it, it became known   
that somehow or other a vote had got upon the records,   
conveying to him outright their ministerial property,   
there was great indignation; and a determined effort   
was made to recover what they declared to be &ldquo;a   
fraudulent conveying-away&rdquo; of the property of the   
society.</p>   
<p>A more violent conflict than any before was let   
loose upon that devoted people. The old passions were   
rekindled. Men ranged themselves as the friends   
and opponents of Mr. Parris in bitter antagonism.   
Rates were not collected; the meeting-house went into   
dilapidation; complaints were made to the County   
Court; orders were issued to collect rates, but they   
were disregarded; and all was confusion, disorder,   
and contention.</p>   
<p>A church was organized in connection with the   
village parish, and Mr. Parris ordained on Monday,   
Nov. 19, 1689. The covenant adopted was the &ldquo;confession of faith owned and consented unto by the elders   
and messengers of the churches assembled at Boston,   
New England, May 12, 1680.&rdquo; In the library of the   
Connecticut Historical Society, there is a manuscript   
volume of sermons and abstracts of sermons preached   
<pb n="299" id="vI299"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1344">   
<figDesc>Page 299.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
by Mr. Parris between November, 1689, and May, 1694.   
It begins with his ordination sermon, which has this   
prefix: &ldquo;My poor and weak ordination sermon, at   
the embodying of a church at Salem Village on the   
19th of the ninth month, 1689, the Rev. Mr. Nicholas   
Noyes embodying of us; who also ordained my most   
unworthy self pastor, and, together with the Rev. Mr.   
Samuel Phillips and the Rev. Mr. John Hale, imposed   
hands, &mdash; the same Mr. Phillips giving me the right   
hand of fellowship with beautiful loveliness and humility.&rdquo; The text is from Josh. v. 9: &ldquo;And the Lord   
said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The first entry in the church-records, after the   
covenant and the names of the members, is the following: &ldquo;Nov. 24, 1689. &mdash; Sab: day. Brother Nathaniel Ingersoll chosen, by a general vote of the   
brethren, to officiate in the place of a deacon for a   
time.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Mr. Parris commenced his administration by showing that he meant to exercise the disciplinary powers   
intrusted to him, as pastor of a church, with a high   
hand, and without much regard to persons or circumstances. Ezekiel Cheever had been a member of the   
mother-church in Salem twenty years before, was   
one of the founders of the parish church, and appears   
to have been a worthy and amiable person, occupying   
and owning the farm of his uncle, Captain Lothrop.   
On the sudden illness of a member of his family,   
being &ldquo;in distress for a horse,&rdquo; none of his own being   
<pb n="300" id="vI300"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1345">   
<figDesc>Page 300.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
available at the time, he rushed, in his hurry and alarm,   
to the stable of a neighbor, took one of his horses,   
&ldquo;without leave or asking of it,&rdquo; and rode, post haste,   
for a doctor. One would have thought that an affair   
of this sort, in such an exigency, might have been left   
to neighborly explanation or adjustment. But Mr.   
Parris regarded it as giving a good opportunity for an   
exercise of power that would strike the terrors of discipline home upon the whole community. About five or   
six weeks after the occurrence, Cheever was dealt with   
in the manner thus described by Mr. Parris, in his   
church-record, dated &ldquo;Sab: 30 March, 1690.&rdquo; He was   
&ldquo;called forth to give satisfaction to the offended church,   
as also the last sabbath he was called forth for the   
same purpose; but then he failed in giving satisfaction,   
by reason of somewhat mincing in the latter part of his   
confession, which, in the former, he had more ingenuously acknowledged: but this day, the church received   
satisfaction, as was testified by their holding-up of their   
hands; and, after the whole, a word of caution by the   
pastor was dropped upon the offender in particular, and   
upon us all in general.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Mr. Parris was evidently inclined to magnify the importance of the church, and to get it into such a state   
of subserviency to his authority, that he could wield it   
effectually as a weapon in his fight with the congregation. With this view, he endeavored to render the   
action of the church as dignified and imposing as   
possible; to enlarge and expand its ceremonial proceedings, and make it the theatre for the exercise of   
<pb n="301" id="vI301"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1346">   
<figDesc>Page 301.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
his authority as its head and ruler. This feature of his   
policy was so strikingly illustrated in the course he   
took in reference to the deacons, that I must present it   
as recorded by him in the church-book. It is worth   
preserving as a curiosity in ecclesiastical administration.</p>   
<p>Nathaniel Ingersoll had been a professor of religion   
almost as long as Mr. Parris had lived. He was eminently a Christian man, of acknowledged piety, and   
beloved and revered by all. He had been the patron,   
benefactor, and guardian of the parish and all its   
interests from its formation. He had long held the   
title of deacon, and exercised the functions of that   
office so far as they could be exercised previous to the   
organization of a church. He had been the almoner   
of the charities of the people, and their adviser and   
religious friend in all things. He was approaching the   
boundaries of advanced years, and already recognized   
among the fathers of the community. It would have   
seemed no more than what all might have expected,   
to have had him recognized as a deacon of the church,   
in full standing, at the first. It was, no doubt, what   
all did expect. But no: he must be put upon probation. He was chosen deacon &ldquo;for the present&rdquo; in   
November, 1689. Mr. Parris kept the matter of confirmation hanging in his own hands for a year and a   
half. The appointment of the other deacon was kept   
suspended for a full year. On the 30th of November,   
1690, there is the following entry: &mdash;</p>   
<pb n="302" id="vI302"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1347">   
<figDesc>Page 302.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;This evening, after the public service was over, the   
church was, by the pastor, desired to stay, and then by him   
Brother Edward Putnam was propounded as a meet person   
for to be chosen as another deacon. The issue whereof was,   
that, it being now an excessive cold day, some did propose   
that another season might be pitched upon for discourse   
thereof. Whereupon the pastor mentioned the next fourth   
day, at two of the clock, at the pastor's house, for further   
discourse thereof; to which the church agreed by not dissenting.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The record of the proceedings on the &ldquo;next fourth   
day&rdquo; is as follows: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;3 December, 1690. &mdash; This afternoon, at a church meeting appointed the last sabbath, Brother Edward Putnam was   
again propounded to the church for choice to office in the place   
of a deacon to join with, and be assistant to, Brother Ingersoll in the service, and in order to said Putnam's ordination   
in the office, upon his well approving himself therein.   
Some proposed that two might be nominated to the church,   
out of which the church to choose one. But arguments   
satisfactory were produced against that way. Some also   
moved for a choice by papers; but that way also was disapproved by the arguments of the pastor and some others.   
In fine, the pastor put it to vote (there appearing not the least   
exception from any, unless a modest and humble exception   
of the person himself, once and again), and it was carried   
in the affirmative by a universal vote, <hi rend="italics">nemine non suffragante.</hi></p>   
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards, the pastor addressed himself to the elected   
brother, and, in the name of the church, desired his answer,   
who replied to this purpose: &mdash;</p>   
<pb n="303" id="vI303"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1348">   
<figDesc>Page 303.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>`Seeing, sir, you say the voice of God's people is the   
voice of God, desiring your prayers and the prayers of   
the church for divine assistance therein, I do accept of the   
call.&rdquo;'</p></q>   
<p>When we consider that Edward Putnam was, at Mr.   
Parris's ordination more than a year before, and had   
been for some time previous to that event, Ingersoll's   
associate deacon, and that there probably never was any   
other person spoken or thought of than these two for   
deacons, it is evident that it was Mr. Parris's policy to   
make a great matter of the affair, and produce a general feeling of the weighty importance of church action   
in the premises. But this was only the beginning of   
the long-drawn ceremonial solemnities by which the   
occasion was magnified.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Sab: day, 7 December, 1690. &mdash; After the evening   
public service was over, several things needful were transacted; viz.: &mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;1. The pastor acquainted those of the church that were   
ignorant of it, that Brother Edward Putnam was chosen deacon the last church meeting.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;2. He also generally admonished those of the brethren   
that were absent at that time, of their disorderliness therein, telling them that such, the apostle bids, should be noted   
or marked (2 Thess. iii. 6-16); that is, with a church   
mark, &mdash; a mark in a disciplinary way; and therefore   
begged amendment for the future in that point and to that   
purpose.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;3. He propounded whether they so far were satisfied   
in Brother Ingersoll's service as to call him to settlement in   
<pb n="304" id="vI304"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1349">   
<figDesc>Page 304.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the deaconship by ordination, or had aught against it. But   
no brother made personal exception. Therefore, it being   
put to vote, it was carried in the affirmative by a plurality,   
if not universality.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;4. The Lord's Table, not being provided for with aught   
else but two pewter tankards, the pastor propounded and desired that the next sacrament-day, which is to be the 21st   
instant, there be a more open and liberal contribution by   
the communicants, that so the deacons may have wherewith   
to furnish the said table decently; which was consented   
to.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The last clause, &ldquo;which was consented to,&rdquo; is in a   
smaller hand than the rest of the record. It was written by Mr. Parris, but apparently some time afterwards,   
and with fainter ink. There is reason to suppose that   
nothing was accomplished at that time in the way of   
getting rid of the &ldquo;pewter tankards.&rdquo; The farmers   
were too hard pressed by taxes imposed by the province,   
and by the weight of local assessments, to listen to   
fanciful appeals. They probably continued for some   
time, and perhaps until after receiving Deacon Ingersoll legacy, in 1720, to get along as they were. They   
did not believe, that, in order to approach the presence,   
and partake of the memorials, of the Saviour, it was   
necessary to bring vessels of silver or gold. In their   
circumstances, gathered in their humble rustic edifice   
for worship, they did not feel that, in the sight of the   
Lord, costly furniture would add to the adornment of   
his table.</p>   
<p>Nearly six months after Putnam's election, Mr.   
<pb n="305" id="vI305"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1350">   
<figDesc>Page 305.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Parris brought up the matter again at a meeting of   
the church, on the 31st of May, 1691, and made a   
speech relating to it, which he entered on the records   
thus: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The pastor spoke to the brethren to this purpose, viz.: &mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Brethren,</hi> &mdash; The ordination of Brother Ingersoll has   
already been voted a good while since, and I thought to have   
consummated the affair a good time since, but have been put   
by, by diversity of occurrents; and, seeing it is so long since,   
I think it needless to make two works of one, and therefore   
intend the ordination of Brother Putnam together with   
Brother Ingersoll in the deaconship, if you continue in the   
same mind as when you elected him: therefore, if you are   
so, let a vote manifest it. Voted by all, or at least the   
most. I observed none that voted not.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>At last the mighty work was accomplished. Deacon   
Ingersoll had been on probation for eighteen months   
from the date of his election, which took place five   
days after Mr. Parris's ordination. His final induction to office was observed with great formality, and in   
the presence of the whole congregation. Mr. Parris   
enters the order of performances in the church records   
as follows: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Sab: 28 June, 1691. &mdash; After the afternoon sermon   
upon 1 Tim. iii. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, as the brethren had   
renewed their call of Brother Ingersoll to the office of   
a deacon, and he himself had declared his acceptance, the   
pastor proceeded to ordain him, using the form following:</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Beloved Brother,</hi> God having called you to the office   
<pb n="306" id="vI306"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1351">   
<figDesc>Page 306.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of a deacon by the choice of the brethren and your own   
acceptance, and that call being now to be consummated   
according to the primitive pattern, 6 Acts 6, by prayer and   
imposition of hands, &mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;We do, therefore, by this solemnity, declare your investiture into that office, solemnly charging you in the name of   
our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of his Church, who walks   
in the midst of his golden candlesticks, with eyes as of a   
flame of fire, exactly observing the demeaner of all in his   
house, both officers and members, that you labor so to carry   
it, as to evidence you are sanctified by grace, qualified for   
this work, and to grow in those qualifications; behaving of   
yourself gravely, sincerely, temperately, with due care for the   
government of your own house, holding the mystery of the   
faith in a pure conscience; that as they in this office are   
called `helps,' so you be helpful in your place and capacity,   
doing what is your part for the promoting of the work of   
Christ here. We do charge you, that, whatever you do in   
this office, you do it faithfully, giving with simplicity, showing mercy with cheerfulness. Look on it, brother, as   
matter of care, and likewise of encouragement, that both the   
office itself and also your being set up in it is of God, who,   
being waited upon, will be with you, and accept you therein,   
assisting you to use the office of a deacon well, so as that   
you may be blameless, purchasing to yourself a good degree   
and great boldness in the faith.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Note.</hi> &mdash; That Brother Putnam was not yet willing to be   
ordained, but desired further considering time, between him   
and I and Brother Ingersoll, in private discourse the week   
before the ordination above said.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>&ldquo;Brother Putnam&rdquo; probably partook of the general   
<pb n="307" id="vI307"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1352">   
<figDesc>Page 307.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
wonder what all this appearance of difficulty and delay,   
under the peculiar circumstances of the case, meant;   
and being, as the record truly says, a modest and   
humble man, he naturally shrank from the formidable   
ceremoniousness and pretentious parade with which   
Mr. Parris surrounded the transaction. At any rate,   
he hesitated long before he was willing to encounter it.   
It is probable that he positively refused to have his induction to the office heralded with such solemn pomp.   
There is no mention of his public ordination, which   
Mr. Parris would not have omitted to record, had any   
such scene occurred. All we know is that he was recognized as deacon forthwith, and held the office for   
forty years.</p>   
<p>The disposition of Mr. Parris to make use of his   
office, as the head of the church, to multiply occasions   
for the exercise of his influence, and to gain control   
over the minds of the brethren, is apparent throughout   
his records. He raised objections in order to show   
how he could remove them, and started difficulties   
about matters which had not before been brought into   
question. In the beginning of his ministry, he manifested this propensity. At a church meeting at   
John Putnam's house, Feb. 20, 1690, less than three   
months after his ordination, he threw open the whole   
question of baptism for discussion among the brethren.   
There is no reason to suppose that their attention had   
been drawn to it before. He propounded the question   
to the plain, practical husbandmen, &ldquo;Who are the   
proper subjects of baptism?&rdquo; He laid down the true   
<pb n="308" id="vI308"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1353">   
<figDesc>Page 308.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
doctrine, as he regarded it, in this answer, &ldquo;Covenant believers and their infant seed.&rdquo; He put the   
answer to vote, and none voted against it. He then   
proceeded with another question, &ldquo;How far may we   
account such seed infant seed, and so to be baptized?&rdquo;   
Here he had got beyond their depth, and, as some of   
them thought, his own too; for there was only a &ldquo;major   
vote&rdquo; in favor of his answer: &ldquo;two or three, I think   
not four, dissented.&rdquo; There was some danger of getting   
into divisions by introducing such questions; but he   
managed to avoid it, so far as his church was concerned.   
He worked them up to the highest confidence in his   
learning and wisdom, and gained complete ascendency   
over them. He aggrandized their sense of importance,   
and accomplished his object in securing their support   
in his controversies with his congregation. The brethren, after a while, became his devoted body-guard, and   
the church a fortress of defence and assault. There is   
reason, however, to believe, that the points he raised on   
the subject of baptism led to perplexities, in some   
minds, which long continued to disturb them. While   
showing off his learning, and displaying his capacity to   
dispose of the deep questions of theology, he let fall   
seeds of division and doubt that ripened into contention in subsequent generations. The only ripple on   
the surface of the Village Church during its long   
record of peace, since the close of his disastrous   
ministry, was occasioned by differing opinions on this   
subject. It required all the wisdom of his successors   
to quiet them. From time to time, formulas had   
<pb n="309" id="vI309"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1354">   
<figDesc>Page 309.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to be constructed, half-way covenants of varying expressions to be framed, to meet and dispose of the difficulties thus gratuitously raised by him.</p>   
<p>The following passages from his record-book show   
how he made much of a matter which any other pastor   
would have quietly arranged without calling for the   
intervention of church or congregation: they are also   
interesting as a picture of the times: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Sab: 9 Aug. 1691. &mdash; After all public worship was   
over, and the church stayed on purpose, I proposed to the   
church whether they were free to admit to baptism, upon   
occasion, such as were not at present free to come up to   
full communion. I told them there was a young woman, by   
name Han: Wilkins, the daughter of our Brother Thomas   
Wilkins, who much desired to be baptized, but yet did not   
dare to come to the Lord's Supper. If they had nothing   
against it, I should take their silence for consent, and in due   
time acquaint them with what she had offered me to my   
satisfaction, and proceed accordingly.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>No answer was made <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> or <hi rend="italics">con,</hi> and so the church   
was dismissed.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Sab: 23 Aug. 1691. &mdash; Hannah Wilkins, aged about   
twenty-one years, was called forth, and her relation read in the   
full assembly, and then it was propounded to the church, that,   
if they had just exceptions, or, on the other hand, had any   
thing farther to encourage, they had opportunity and liberty   
to speak. None said any thing but Brother Bray Wilkins   
(Han: grandfather), who said, that, for all he knew, such   
a relation as had been given and a conversation suitable   
<pb n="310" id="vI310"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1355">   
<figDesc>Page 310.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
(as he judged hers to be) was enough to enjoy full communion. None else saying any thing, it was put to vote whether   
they were so well satisfied as to receive this young woman   
into membership, and therefore initiate her therein by baptism. It was voted fully. Whereupon the covenant was   
given to her as if she had entered into full communion.   
And the pastor told her, in the name of the church, that we   
would expect and wait for her rising higher, and therefore   
advised her to attend all means conscientiously for that   
end.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;After all, I pronounced her a member of this church, and   
then baptized her.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;28 August, 1691. &mdash; This day, Sister Hannah Wilkins   
aforesaid came to me, and spake to this like effect, following: &mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Before I was baptized (you know, sir), I was desirous   
of communion at the Lord's Table, but not yet; I was afraid   
of going so far: but since my baptism I find my desires   
growing to the Lord's Table, and I am afraid to turn my   
back upon that ordinance, or to refuse to partake thereof.   
And that which moves me now to desire full communion,   
which I was afraid of before, is that of Thomas, 20 John 26,   
&amp;c., where he, being absent from the disciples, though but   
once, lost a sight of Christ, and got more hardness of heart,   
or increase of unbelief. And also those words of Ananias   
to Paul after his conversion, 22 Acts 16, `And now why   
tarriest thou? Arise,' &amp;c. So I am afraid of tarrying.   
The present time is only mine. And God having, beyond   
my deserts, graciously opened a door, I look upon it my duty   
to make present improvement of it.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Sab: and Sacrament Day, 30 Aug. 1691. &mdash; Sister   
Han: Wilkins's motion (before the celebration of the   
<pb n="311" id="vI311"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1356">   
<figDesc>Page 311.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Lord's Supper was begun) was mentioned or propounded   
to the church, and what she said to me (before hinted) read   
to them, and then their vote was called for, to answer her   
desire if they saw good; whereupon the church voted in the   
affirmative plentifully.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The foregoing passages illustrate Mr. Parris's propensity to magnify the operations of the church, and   
to bring its movements as conspicuously and as often   
as possible before the eyes of the people. It is evident   
that the humble and timid scruples of this interesting   
and intelligent young woman might have been met and   
removed by personal conference with her pastor. As   
her old grandfather seemed to think, there was no   
difficulty in the case whatever. The reflections of a   
few days made the path plain before her. But Mr.   
Parris paraded the matter on three sabbaths before the   
church, and on one of them at least before the congregation. He called her to come forth, and stand out in   
the presence of the &ldquo;full assembly.&rdquo; As the result of   
the ordeal, she owned the covenant; the church voted   
her in, as to full communion; and the pastor pronounced her a member of the church, and baptized her   
as such. Her sensible conversation with him the next   
Friday was evidently intended for the satisfaction of   
him and others, as explaining her appearance at the   
next communion. But another opportunity was offered   
to make a display of the case, and he could not resist   
the temptation. He desired to create an impression   
by reading what she had said to him in his study, before the church, if not before the whole congregation.   
<pb n="312" id="vI312"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1357">   
<figDesc>Page 312.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
To give a show of propriety in bringing it forward   
again, he felt that some action must be had upon it;   
hence the vote. Accordingly, Hannah Wilkins appears   
by the record to have been twice, on two successive   
Lord's Days, voted &ldquo;plentifully&rdquo; into the Salem   
Village Church, when there was no occasion for such   
an extraordinary repetition, as everybody from the   
first welcomed her into it with the cordial confidence   
she merited. I have spread out this proceeding to   
your view, not altogether from its intrinsic interest,   
but because, perhaps, it affords the key to interpret the   
course of this ill-starred man in his wrangles with his   
congregation, and his terrible prominency in the awful   
scenes of the witchcraft delusion. He seemed to have   
had a love of excitement that was irrepressible, an all   
but insane passion for getting up a scene. When we   
come to the details of our story, it will be for a charitable judgment to determine whether this trait of his   
nature may not be regarded as the cause of all the   
woes in which he involved others and became involved   
himself.</p>   
<p>The church records are, in one respect, in singular contrast with the parish records. The latter are   
often silent in reference to matters of interest at   
the time, which might without impropriety have been   
entered in them. They are confined strictly to votes   
and proceedings in legal meetings, or what purport to   
have been meetings legally called; and we look in vain   
for comments or notices relating to outside matters.   
Except when kept by Sergeant Thomas Putnam, they   
<pb n="313" id="vI313"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1358">   
<figDesc>Page 313.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
are defective and imperfect. The church records,   
while made by Mr. Parris, are full of side remarks, and   
touches of criticism concerning whatever was going on.   
This makes them particularly interesting and valuable   
now. They are composed in their author's clear,   
natural, and sprightly style; and, although for the most   
part in an exceedingly small hand, are legible with   
perfect ease, and give us a transcript, not only of the   
formal doings of the church, but of the writer's mind   
and feelings about matters and things in general. We   
gather from them by far the greater part of all we   
know relating to his quarrel with his congregation.</p>   
<p>This subject constantly engrossed his thoughts. He   
was continually introducing, at church meetings, complaints against the conduct of the parish committee,   
and enlarging upon the wrongs he was suffering at   
their hands. He took occasion on Lecture days, if   
not in ordinary discourses on the Lord's Day, to give   
all possible circulation and publicity to his grievances.   
The effect of this was, instead of bringing his people   
into subjection and carrying his points against them,   
to aggravate their alienation. His manner of dealing   
with the difficulties of the situation into which they   
had been brought was harsh and exasperating, and   
utterly injudicious, imprudent, and mischievous in all   
its bearings, producing a condition of things truly   
scandalous. His notions and methods, acquired in his   
mercantile life; his haggling with the people about the   
terms of his salary; and his general manner and tone,   
particularly so far as they had been formed by residence   
<pb n="314" id="vI314"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1359">   
<figDesc>Page 314.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in West-India slave Islands,&mdash;were thoroughly distasteful, and entirely repugnant, to the feelings, notions,   
ideas, and spirit of the farmers of Salem Village. At   
their meetings, they showed a continually increasing   
strength of opposition to him, and were careful to   
appoint committees who could not be brought under   
his influence, and would stand firm against all outside   
pressure.</p>   
<p>It is quite apparent, that Mr. Parris employed his   
church, and the ministerial offices generally, as engines   
to operate against his opponents; and sometimes rather   
unscrupulously, as a collocation of dates and entries   
shows. A meeting of the parish was warned to be   
held Oct. 16, 1691. It was important to bring his   
machinery to bear upon the feelings of the people, so   
as to strengthen the hands of his friends at that meeting. The following entry is in the church-book, dated   
8th October, 1691: &ldquo;Being my Lecture-day, after public service was ended, I was so bare of firewood, that I   
was forced publicly to desire the inhabitants to take   
care that I might be provided for; telling them, that,   
had it not been for Mr. Corwin (who had bought wood,   
being then at my house), I should hardly have any to   
burn.&rdquo; According to his own account, as we have   
seen, it had been arranged, by mutual agreement, that   
he was to provide his own firewood, six pounds per   
annum having been added to his salary for that purpose. He selected that item as one of the necessaries   
of which he was in want, probably because, as the winter was approaching, it would be the best point on   
<pb n="315" id="vI315"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1360">   
<figDesc>Page 315.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
which to appeal to the public sympathies, and get up a   
clamor against his opponents.</p>   
<p>The parish meeting was duly held on the 16th of   
October. Mr. Parris's speech, at the preceding Lecture, about &ldquo;firewood,&rdquo; was found not to have produced  
the desired effect. The majority against him was as   
strong as ever. A committee made up of his opponents was elected. A motion to instruct them to make   
a rate was rejected, and a warrant ordered to be forthwith issued for a special meeting of the inhabitants, to   
examine into all the circumstances connected with the   
settlement of Mr. Parris, and to ascertain whether   
the meetings which had acted therein were legally   
called, and by what means the right and title of the   
parish to its ministry house and lands had been brought   
into question. This was pressing matters to an issue.   
Mr. Parris saw it, and determined to meet it in advance.   
He resorted to his church, as usual, to execute his   
plan, as the following entries on the record-book   
show: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;1 Nov. 1691. &mdash; The pastor desired the brethren to   
meet at my house, on to-morrow, an hour and half before   
sundown.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;2 Nov. 1691. &mdash; After sunset, about seventeen of the   
brethren met; to whom, after prayer, I spoke to this effect:   
Brethren, I have not much to trouble you with now;   
but you know what committee, the last town-meeting here,   
were chosen; and what they have done, or intend to do; it   
may be better than I. But, you see, I have hardly any wood   
<pb n="316" id="vI316"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1361">   
<figDesc>Page 316.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to burn. I need say no more, but leave the matter to your   
serious and godly consideration.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;In fine, after some discourse to and fro, the church voted   
that Captain Putnam and the two deacons should go, as messengers from the church, to the committee, to desire them to   
make a rate for the minister, and to take care of necessary   
supplies for him; and that said messengers should make   
their return to the church the next tenth day, an hour   
before sunset, at the minister's house, where they would   
expect it.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;10 Nov. 1691. &mdash; The messengers abovesaid came   
with their return, as appointed; which was, that the committee did not see good to take notice of their message,   
without they had some letter to show under the church's and   
pastor's hand. But, at this last church meeting, besides   
the three messengers, but three other brethren did appear,   
&mdash; namely, Brother Thomas Putnam, Thomas Wilkins,   
and Peter Prescot, &mdash; which slight and neglect of other   
brethren did not a little trouble me, as I expressed myself.   
But I told these brethren I expected the church should be   
more mindful of me than other people, and their way was   
plain before them, &amp;c.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Sab: 15 Nov. 1691. &mdash; The church were desired to   
meet at Brother Nathaniel Putnam's, the next 18th instant,   
at twelve o'clock, to spend some time in prayer, and seeking God's presence with us, the next Lord's Day, at his   
table, as has been usual with us, some time before the   
sacrament.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;18 Nov. 1691. &mdash; After some time spent, as above   
said, at this church meeting, the pastor desired the brethren   
to stay, forasmuch as he had somewhat to offer to them,   
which was to this purpose; viz.: Brethren, several church   
<pb n="317" id="vI317"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1362">   
<figDesc>Page 317.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
meetings have been occasionally warned, and sometimes the   
appearance of the brethren is but small to what it might be   
expected, and particularly the case mentioned 10th instant.   
I told them I did not desire to warn meetings unnecessarily,   
and, therefore, when I did, I prayed them they would regularly attend them.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, I told them I had scarce wood enough to   
burn till the morrow, and prayed that some care might be   
taken. In fine, after discourses passed, these following votes   
were made unanimously, namely: &mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;1. That it was needful that complaint should be made   
to the next honored County Court, to sit at Salem, the next   
third day of the week, against the neglects of the present   
committee.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;2. That the said complaint should be drawn up, which   
was immediately done by one of the brethren, and consented to.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;3. That our brethren, Nathaniel Putnam, Thomas Putnam, and Thomas Wilkins, should sign said complaint in   
behalf of the church.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;4. Last, That our brethren, Captain John Putnam   
and the two deacons, should be improved to present the said   
complaint to the said Court.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;In the mean time, the pastor desired the brethren that   
care might be taken that he might not be destitute of   
wood.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The record proceeds to give several other votes, the   
object of which was to arrange the details of the manner in which the business was to be put into court.   
There we leave it for the present, and there it remained for nearly seven years. Mr. Parris probably   
<pb n="318" id="vI318"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1363">   
<figDesc>Page 318.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
got the start of his opponents, in being first to invoke   
the law. This is what he meant when he told his   
church &ldquo;that their way was plain before them.&rdquo; If   
extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances had not   
intervened, the case would more speedily have been   
disposed of, and we cannot doubt what would have   
been its issue. Whatever might be the bias or prejudice of the courts, or however they might have attempted to enforce their first decisions, there can be   
no question, that, in such a contest, the people would   
have finally prevailed. The committee were men competent to carry the parish through. A religious society,   
with such feelings between them and their minister,   
after all that had happened, and the just grounds   
given them of dissatisfaction and resentment, could   
not always, or long, have been kept under such an   
infliction.</p>   
<p>In the immediately preceding entries, there are some   
points that illustrate the policy on which Mr. Parris   
acted, and exhibit the skill and vigilance of his management. The motive that led him to harp so constantly upon &ldquo;firewood&rdquo; is obvious. It was to create   
a sympathy in his behalf, and bring opprobrium upon   
his opponents. But it cannot stand the test of scrutiny: for it had been expressly agreed, as I have said,   
that he should find his own fuel; and it cannot be supposed that his friends, if he then had any real ones,   
surrounded, as they were, with forests of their own,   
within sight of the parsonage, would have allowed   
him to suffer from this cause. There is indication   
<pb n="319" id="vI319"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1364">   
<figDesc>Page 319.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that the &ldquo;brethren of the church&rdquo; were getting lukewarm, as their non-attendance at important meetings   
led Mr. Parris to fear. At any rate, he felt it necessary to administer some rather significant rebukes to   
them. The meeting for prayer, preparatory to the ensuing communion service, was very adroitly converted   
into a business consultation to inaugurate a lawsuit.   
But the most characteristic thing, in this part of the   
church-book, is a marginal entry, against the first   
paragraph of the record of the 2d November, 1691. It   
is in these words: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The town-meeting, about or at 16th October last. Jos:   
Porter, Jos: Hutchinson, Jos: Putnam, Dan: Andrew,   
Francis Nurse.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>These were the committee appointed at the meeting.   
Their names, thus abbreviated, are given, and not a   
syllable added. But the manner, the then state of   
things, and their relation to the controversy, give a   
deep import and intense bitterness to this entry. He   
knew the men, and in their names read the handwriting on the wall.</p>   
<p>But a turn was soon given to the current that was   
bearing Mr. Parris down. A power was evoked &mdash;   
whether he raised it designedly, or whether it merely   
happened to appear on the scene, we cannot certainly   
say; but it came into action just at the nick of time   
&mdash; which instantly reversed the position of the parties,   
and clothed him with a terrible strength, enabling him   
to crush his opponents beneath his feet. In a few short   
<pb n="320" id="vI320"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1365">   
<figDesc>Page 320.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
months, he was the arbiter of life and death of all the   
people of the village and the country. &ldquo;Jos: Porter   
and Jos: Hutchinson&rdquo; escaped. The power of destruction broke down before it became strong enough   
to reach them perhaps. &ldquo;Jos: Putnam&rdquo; was kept for   
six months in the constant peril of his life. During all   
that time, he and his family were armed, and kept   
watch. &ldquo;Dan: Andrew&rdquo; saved himself from the   
gallows by flight to a foreign land. The unutterable   
woes brought upon the family of &ldquo;Francis Nurse&rdquo; remain to be related.</p>   
<p>The witchcraft delusion at Salem Village, in 1692,   
has attracted universal attention, constitutes a permanent chapter in the world's history, and demands a full   
exposition, and, if possible, a true solution. Being   
convinced that it cannot be correctly interpreted without a thorough knowledge of the people among whom   
it appeared, I have felt it indispensable, before opening   
its scenes to view, or treating the subject of demonology, of which it was an outgrowth, in the first place   
to prepare myself, and those who accompany me in its   
examination and discussion, to fully comprehend it, by   
traversing the ground over which we have now passed.   
By a thorough history of Salem Village from its origin   
to the period of our story, by calling its founders and   
their children and successors into life before you by   
personal, private, domestic, and local details, gleaned   
from old records and documents, I have tried to place   
you at the standpoint from which the entire occurrence   
can be intelligibly contemplated. We can in no other   
<pb n="321" id="vI321"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1366">   
<figDesc>Page 321.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
way get a true view of a passage of history than by   
looking at the men who acted in it, as they really were.   
We must understand their characters, enter into their   
life, see with their eyes, feel with their hearts, and   
be enveloped, as it were, with their associations, sentiments, beliefs, and principles of action. In this way   
only can we bring the past into our presence, comprehend its elements, fathom its depths, read its meaning,   
or receive its lessons.</p>   
<p>I am confident you will agree with me, that it was   
not because the people of Salem Village were more   
ignorant, stupid, or weak-minded than the people of   
other places, that the delusion made its appearance or   
held its sway among them. This is a vital point to the   
just consideration of the subject. I do not mean   
justice to them so much as to ourselves and all who   
wish to understand, and be benefited by understanding, the subject. There never was a community composed originally of better materials, or better trained   
in all good usages. Although the generations subsequent to the first had not enjoyed, to any considerable   
extent, the advantages of education, the circumstances   
of their experience had kept their faculties in the fullest exercise. They were an energetic and intelligent   
people. Their moral condition, social intercourse,   
manners, and personal bearing, were excellent. The   
lesson of the catastrophe impending over them, at the   
point to which we have arrived, can only be truly   
and fully received, for the warning of all coming time,   
by having correct views on this point. The delusion   
<pb n="322" id="vI322"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1367">   
<figDesc>Page 322.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that brought ruin upon them was not the result of any   
essential inferiority in their moral or intellectual condition. What we call their ignorance was the received   
philosophy and wisdom of the day, accepted generally   
by the great scholars of that and previous ages,   
preached from the pulpits, taught in the universities,   
recognized in law and in medicine as well as theology,   
and carried out in the proceedings of public tribunals   
and legislative assemblies.</p>   
<p>The history of the planting, settlement, and progress   
of Salem Village, to 1692, has now been given. We   
know, so far as existing materials within reach enable us to know, what sort of a population occupied the   
place at the date of our story. Their descent, breeding, and experiences have been related. They were, at   
least, equal in intelligence to any of the people of their   
day. They were strenuous in action, trained to earnestness and zeal, accustomed to become deeply engaged   
in whatever interested them, and to take strong hold of   
the ideas and sentiments they received. It becomes   
necessary, therefore, in the next place, to ascertain   
what their ideas were in reference to witchcraft, diabolical agency, and supernaturalism generally. I shall   
proceed accordingly to give the condition of opinion,   
at that time, on the subject of demonology.</p>

<p>DEMONOLOGY, as a general term, may be employed, for convenience, to include a whole   
class of ideas &mdash; which, under different names and a   
vast variety of conceptions, have come through all   
ages, and prevailed among all races of mankind &mdash;   
relating to the supposed agency of supernatural, invisible, and spiritual beings in terrestrial affairs. As   
necessarily applicable to evil spirits, particularly to   
the arch-enemy and supreme adversary of God and   
man under the name of Satan or the Devil, the term   
does not appear to have been used in ancient times.   
Professed communications with supernatural beings   
were not originally stamped with a diabolical character, but, like some alleged to be had in our day,   
were regarded as innocent, and even creditable. Men   
sought to hold intercourse with spirits belonging to the   
unseen world, as some persons do now; assuming that   
they were worthy of confidence, and that responses from   
<pb n="326" id="vI326"/>

<figDesc>Page 326.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
them were valuable and desirable. This was the case   
under the reign of classical mythology, and of heathen   
superstition in general. Those individuals who were   
supposed to be conversant with demons were looked   
upon by the credulous multitude as a highly privileged class; and they arrogated the credit of being   
raised to a higher sphere of knowledge than the rest of   
mankind.</p>   
<p>It is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the   
Hebrew polity, that it denounced such pretended communications as criminal, and subjected the practice to   
the highest penalties. It was assumed to be dangerous; the welfare of individuals and of society requiring that such pretensions and practices should be   
abandoned. The observation and experience of mankind have justified this view. In the first ages of   
Christianity, it was believed that the Divine Being   
alone was to be sought in prayer for light and guidance by the human soul. Gradually, as the dark   
ages began to settle upon Christendom, the doctrine   
of the Devil as the head and ruler of a world of   
demons, and as able to hold communications with   
mortals, to interfere in their affairs, and to exercise   
more or less control over the laws and phenomena of   
nature, began to become prevalent. It was believed   
that human beings could enter into alliance with the   
Prince of the power of the air; become his confederates; join in a league with him and wicked spirits   
subordinate to him, in undermining the Gospel and   
overthrowing the Church; and conspire and co-operate   
<pb n="327" id="vI327"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1372">   
<figDesc>Page 327.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in rebellion against God. This, of course, was regarded as the most flagrant of crimes, and constituted the   
real character of the sin denominated &ldquo;witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>As the fullest, most memorable, and, by the notice   
it has ever since attracted throughout the world, the   
pre-eminent instance and demonstration of this supposed iniquity was in the crisis that took place in   
Salem Village in 1692, it justly claims a place in history. The community in which it occurred has been   
fully described, in its moral, social, and intellectual   
condition, so far as the materials I have been enabled   
to obtain have rendered possible. It has, I believe,   
been made to appear, that, in their training, experience, and traits of character, they were well adapted   
to give full effect to any excitement, or earnest action   
of any kind, that could be got up among them, &mdash; a   
people of great energy, courage, and resolution, well   
prepared to carry out to its natural and legitimate   
results any movement, and follow established convictions fearlessly to logical conclusions. The experiment of bringing supernaturalism to operate in human   
affairs, to become a ground of action in society, and to   
interfere in the relations of life and the dealings of   
men with each other, was as well tried upon this people as it ever could or can be anywhere.</p>   
<p>All that remains to be brought to view, before entering upon the details of the narrative, is to give a just   
and adequate idea of the form and shape in which the   
general subject of supernaturalism, in its aspect as   
demonology, lay in the minds of men here at that   
<pb n="328" id="vI328"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1373">   
<figDesc>Page 328.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
time. To do this, I must give a sketch, as condensed   
and brief as I can make it, of the formation and progress of opinions and notions touching the subject,   
until they reached their full demonstration and final   
explosion, in this neighborhood, at Salem Village, near   
the close of the seventeenth century.</p>   
<p>No person who looks around him on the scene in   
which he is placed, reflects upon the infinite wonders   
of creation, and meditates upon the equal wonders of   
his own mind, can be at a loss respecting the sources   
and causes of superstition. Let him transport himself   
back to the condition of a primitive and unlettered   
people, before whom the world appears in all its original and sublime mystery. Science has not lifted to   
their eyes the curtain behind which the secret operations of nature are carried on. They observe the tides   
rise and fall, but know not the attractive law that regulates their movements; they contemplate the procession of the seasons, without any conception of the   
principles and causes that determine and produce   
their changes; they witness the storm as it rises in   
its wrath; they listen with awe to the thunder-peal,   
and gaze with startling terror upon the lightning as it   
flashes from within the bosom of the black cloud, and   
are utterly ignorant to what power to attribute the   
dreadful phenomena; they look upward to the face of   
the sky, and see the myriad starry hosts that glitter   
there, and all is to them a mighty maze of dazzling   
confusion. It is for their fancy to explain, interpret,   
and fill up the brilliant and magnificent scene.</p>   
<pb n="329" id="vI329"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1374">   
<figDesc>Page 329.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>The imagination was the faculty the exercise of   
which was chiefly called for in such a state as this.   
Before science had traced the operations and unfolded   
the secrets of nature, man was living in a world full   
of marvel and mystery. His curiosity was attracted   
to every object within the reach of his senses; and, in   
the absence of knowledge, it was imagination alone   
that could make answer to its inquiries. It is natural   
to suppose that he would be led to attribute all the   
movements and operations of the external world which   
did not appear to be occasioned by the exercise of his   
own power, or the power of any other animal, to the   
agency of supernatural beings. We may also conclude, that his belief would not be likely to fix upon   
the notion of a single overruling Being. Although   
revelation and science have disclosed to us a beautiful   
and entire unity and harmony in the creation, the phenomena of the external world would probably impress   
the unenlightened and unphilosophic observer with the   
belief that there was a diversity in the powers which   
caused them. He would imagine the agency of a   
being of an amiable and beneficent spirit in the bright   
sunshine, the fresh breeze, and the mild moonlight;   
and his fancy would suggest to his fears, that a dark,   
severe, and terrible being was in the ascendant during   
a day overshadowed by frowning clouds, or a night   
black with the storm and torn by the tempest.</p>   
<p>By the aid of such reflections as these, we are easily   
conducted to a satisfactory and sufficient explanation   
of the origin of the mythology and fabulous superstitions   
<pb n="330" id="vI330"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1375">   
<figDesc>Page 330.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of all ancient and primitive nations. From   
this the progress is plain, obvious, and immediate to   
the pretensions of magicians, diviners, sorcerers, conjurers, oracles, soothsayers, augurs, and the whole   
catalogue of those persons who professed to hold intercourse with higher and spiritual powers. There   
are several classes into which they may be divided.</p>   
<p>There were those who, to acquire an influence over   
the people, pretended to possess the confidence, and   
enjoy the friendship and counsel, of some one or more   
deities. Such was Numa, the early lawgiver of the   
Roman State. In order to induce the people to adopt   
the regulations, institutions, and religious rites he   
proposed, he made them believe that he had access   
to a divinity, and received all his plans and ideas as   
a communication from on high.</p>   
<p>Persons who, in consequence of their superior   
acquirements, were enabled to excel others in any   
pursuit, or who could foresee and avail themselves   
of events in the natural world, were liable, without   
any intention to deceive, to be classed under some of   
these denominations. For instance, a Roman farmer,   
Furius Cresinus, surpassed all his neighbors in the   
skill and success with which he managed his agricultural affairs. He was accordingly accused of using   
magic arts in the operations of his farm. So far   
were his neighbors carried by their feelings of envy   
and jealousy, that they explained the fact of his being   
able to derive more produce from a small lot of land   
than they could from large ones, by charging him   
<pb n="331" id="vI331"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1376">   
<figDesc>Page 331.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
with attracting and drawing off the productions of   
their fields into his own by the employment of certain   
mysterious charms. For his defence, as we are informed by Pliny, he produced his strong and well ploughs, his light and convenient spades, and   
his sun-burnt daughters, and pointing to them exclaimed: &ldquo;Here are my charms; this is my magic;   
these only are the witchcraft I have used.&rdquo; Zoroaster, the great philosopher and astronomer of the ancient East, was charged with divination and magic,   
merely, it is probable, because he possessed uncommon acquirements.</p>   
<p>There were persons who had acquired an extraordinary amount of natural knowledge, and, for the   
sake of being regarded with wonder and awe by the   
people, pretended to obtain their superior endowments   
from supernatural beings. They affected the name   
and character of sorcerers, diviners, and soothsayers.   
It is easy to conceive of the early existence and the   
great influence of such impostors. Patient observation, and often mere accident, would suggest discoveries of the existence and operation of natural causes   
in producing phenomena before ascribed to superhuman agency. The knowledge thus acquired would   
be cautiously concealed, and cunningly used, to create   
astonishment and win admiration. Its fortunate possessors were enabled to secure the confidence, obedience, and even reverence, of the benighted and   
deceived people.</p>   
<p>Every one, indeed, who could discover a secret of   
<pb n="332" id="vI332"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1377">   
<figDesc>Page 332.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
nature, and keep it secret, was able to impose himself on the world as being allied with supernatural   
powers. Hence arose the whole host of diviners,   
astrologers, soothsayers, and oracles. After having   
once acquired possession of the credulous faith of the   
people, they could impose upon them almost without   
limit.</p>   
<p>Those who pretended to hold this kind of intercourse with divinity became, as a natural consequence,   
the priests of the nation, constituted a distinct and   
regular profession, and perpetuated their body by the   
admission of new members, to whom they explained   
their arts, and communicated their knowledge. While   
they were continually discovering and applying the   
secret principles and laws of nature, and the people   
were kept in utter ignorance and darkness, it is no   
wonder that they reached a great and unparalleled   
degree of power over the mass of the population. In   
this manner we account for the origin, and trace the   
history, of the Chaldean priests in Assyria, the Bramins of India, the Magi of Persia, the Oracles of   
Greece, the Augurs of Italy, the Druids of Britain,   
and the Pow-wows, Prophets, or &ldquo;Medicins,&rdquo; as they   
sometimes called them, among our Indians.</p>   
<p>It is probable that the witches mentioned in the   
Scriptures were of this description. Neither in sacred   
nor profane ancient history do we find what was understood in the days of our ancestors by witchcraft,   
which meant a formal and actual compact with the   
great Prince of evil beings. The sorcery of antiquity   
<pb n="333" id="vI333"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1378">   
<figDesc>Page 333.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
consisted in pretending to possess certain mysterious   
charms, and to do by their means, or by the co of superhuman spirits, without any reference to   
their character as evil or good beings, what transcends the action of mere natural powers.</p>   
<p>The witch of Endor, for instance, was a conjurer   
and necromancer, rather than a witch. By referring   
to the 28th chapter of 1 Samuel, where the interview   
between her and Saul is related, you will find no   
ground for the opinion that the being from whom   
she pretended to receive her mysterious power was   
Satan. Saul, as the ruler of a people who were under   
the special government, and enjoyed the peculiar protection of the true God, had forbidden, under the   
sanction of the highest penalties, the exercise of the   
arts of divination and sorcery within his jurisdiction.   
Some time after this, the unfortunate monarch was   
overtaken by trouble and distress. His enemies had   
risen up, and were gathered in fearful strength around   
him. His &ldquo;heart greatly trembled,&rdquo; a dark and   
gloomy presentiment came over his spirit, and his   
bosom was convulsed by an agony of solicitude. He   
turned toward his God for light and strength. He applied for relief to the priests of the altar, and to the   
prophets of the Most High; but his prayers were unanswered, and his efforts vain. In his sorrow and apprehension, he appealed to a woman who was reputed to   
have supernatural powers, and to hold communion   
with spiritual beings; thus violating his own law, and   
departing from duty and fidelity to his God. He   
<pb n="334" id="vI334"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1379">   
<figDesc>Page 334.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
begged her to recall Samuel to life, that he might be   
comforted and instructed by him. She pretended to   
comply with his request; but, before she could commence her usual mysterious operations, Samuel arose!   
and the forlorn, wretched, and heart-broken king listened to his tremendous doom, as it was uttered by the   
spirit of the departed prophet.</p>   
<p>I have alluded particularly to the witch of Endor,   
because she will serve to illustrate the sorcery or   
divination of antiquity. She was probably possessed   
of some secret knowledge of natural properties; was   
skilful in the use of her arts and pretended charms;   
had, perhaps, the peculiar powers of a ventriloquist;   
and, by successful imposture, had acquired an uncommon degree of notoriety, and the entire confidence of   
the public. She professed to be in alliance with supernatural beings, and, by their assistance, to raise the   
dead.</p>   
<p>This passage has afforded a topic for a great deal of   
discussion among interpreters. It seems to me, on the   
face of the narrative, to suggest the following view of   
the transaction: The woman was an impostor. When   
she summoned the spirit of Samuel, instead of the results of her magic lantern, or of whatever contrivances   
she may have had, by the immediate agency of the   
Almighty the spirit of Samuel really rose, to the consternation and horror of the pretended necromancer.   
The writer appears to have indicated this as the   
proper interpretation of the scene, by saying, &ldquo;that,   
when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud   
<pb n="335" id="vI335"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1380">   
<figDesc>Page 335.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
voice;&rdquo; thus giving evidence of alarm and surprise   
totally different from the deportment of such pretenders on such occasions: they used rather to exhibit joy   
at the success of their arts, and a proud composure   
and dignified complacency in the control they were   
believed to exercise over the spirits that appeared to   
have obeyed their call. Sir Walter Scott took this   
view of the transaction. His opinion, it is true, would   
be considered more important in any other department   
than that of biblical interpretation: on all questions,   
however, connected with the spiritual world of fancy   
and with its history, he must be allowed to speak, if not   
with the authority, at least with the tone of a master.   
This wonderful author, in the infinite profusion and   
variety of his productions, published a volume upon   
Demonology and Witchcraft: it is, of course, entertaining and instructive to all who are curious to know   
the capacity and to appreciate the operations of the   
human imagination.</p>   
<p>It will be regarded by intelligent and judicious persons as a circumstance of importance in reference to   
the view now given of the transaction in which the   
witch of Endor acts the leading part, that Hugh   
Farmer, beyond all question the most learned, discreet, and profound writer on such subjects, is inclined   
to throw the weight of his authority in its favor. His   
ample and elaborate discussion of the question is to be   
seen in his work on Miracles, chap. iv. sec. 2.</p>   
<p>Among the heathen nations of antiquity, the art of   
divination consisted, to a great degree, in the magical   
<pb n="336" id="vI336"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1381">   
<figDesc>Page 336.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
use of mysterious charms. Many plants were considered as possessed of wonderful virtues, and there was   
scarcely a limit to the supposed power of those persons   
who knew how to use and apply them skilfully. Virgil,   
in his eighth eclogue, thus speaks of this species of   
sorcery: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;These herbs did M&oelig;ris give to me.</l>   
<l rend="indent">And poisons pluckt at Pontus;</l>   
<l>For there they grow and multiplie</l>   
<l rend="indent">And do not so amongst us:</l>   
<l>With these she made herselfe become</l>   
<l rend="indent">A wolfe, and hid hir in the wood;</l>   
<l>She fetcht up souls out of their toome,</l>   
<l rend="indent">Removing corne from where it stood.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>In the fourth &aelig;neid, the lovesick Tyrian queen is   
thus made to describe the magic which was then believed to be practised: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;Rejoice,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;instructed from above,</l>

<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1382">   
<figDesc>Page 337.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>Tibullus, in the second elegy of his first book, gives   
the following account of the powers ascribed to a magician: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;She plucks each star out of his throne,</l>   
<l rend="indent">And turneth back the raging waves;</l>   
<l>With charms she makes the earth to cone,</l>   
<l rend="indent">And raiseth souls out of their graves;</l>   
<l>She burns men's bones as with a fire,</l>   
<l rend="indent">And pulleth down the lights of Heaven,</l>   
<l>And makes it snow at her desire</l>   
<l rend="indent">E'en in the midst of summer season.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>These views continued to hold undisturbed dominion   
over the people during a long succession of centuries. As the twilight of the dark ages began to settle   
upon Christendom, superstition, that night-blooming   
plant, extended itself rapidly, and in all directions,   
over the surface of the world. While every thing else   
drooped and withered, it struck deeper its roots, spread   
wider its branches, and brought forth more abundantly   
its fruit. The unnumbered fables of Greek and Roman mythology, the arts of augury and divination, the   
visions of oriental romance, the fanciful and attenuated   
theories of the later philosophy, the abstract and spiritual doctrines of Platonism, and all the grosser and   
wilder conceptions of the northern conquerors of the   
Roman Empire, became mingled together in the faith   
of the inhabitants of the European kingdoms. From   
this multifarious combination, the infinitely diversified   
popular superstitions of the modern nations have   
sprung.</p>   
<p>We first begin to trace the clear outlines of the doctrine   
<pb n="338" id="vI338"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1383">   
<figDesc>Page 338.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of witchcraft not far from the commencement of   
the Christian era. It presupposes the belief of the   
Devil. I shall not enter upon the question, whether   
the Scriptures, properly interpreted, require the belief   
of the existence of such a being. Directing our attention solely to profane sources of information, we   
discover the heathen origin of the belief of the existence of the Devil in the ancient systems of oriental   
philosophy. Early observers of nature in the East   
were led to the conclusion, that the world was a divided   
empire, ruled by the alternate or simultaneous energy   
of two great antagonist principles or beings, one perfectly good, and the other perfectly bad. It was for a   
long time, and perhaps is at this day, a prevalent faith   
among Christians, that the Bible teaches a similar doctrine; that it presents, to our adoration and obedience,   
a being of infinite perfections in the Deity; and to our   
abhorrence and our fears, a being infinitely wicked,   
and of great power, in the Devil.</p>   
<p>It is obvious, that, when the entire enginery of supernaturalism was organized in adaptation to the idea of   
the Devil, and demonology became synonymous with   
diabolism, the credulity and superstition of mankind   
would give a wide extension to that form of belief. It   
soon occupied a large space in the theories of religion   
and the fancies of the people, and got to be a leading   
element in the life of society. It made its impress on   
the forms of speech, and many of the phrases to which   
it gave rise still remain in familiar use. It figured in the   
rituals of religion, in the paraphernalia of public shows,   
<pb n="339" id="vI339"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1384">   
<figDesc>Page 339.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and in fireside tales. It afforded leading characters to   
the drama in the miracle plays and the moral plays,   
as they were called, at successive periods. It offered a   
ready weapon to satire, and also to defamation. Gerbert, a native of France, who was elevated to the pontificate about the close of the tenth century, under the   
name of Sylvester II., is eulogized by Mosheim as the   
first great restorer of science and literature. He was   
a person of an extensive and sublime genius, of wonderful attainments in learning, particularly mathematics,   
geometry, and arithmetic. He broke the profound   
sleep of the dark ages, and awakened the torpid intellect of the European nations. His efforts in this direction roused the apprehensions and resentment of the   
monks; and they circulated, after Gerbert's death, and   
made the ignorant masses believe the story, that he had   
obtained his rapid promotion in the Church by the   
practice of the black art, which he disguised under   
the show of learning; that he secured the Archbishopric of Ravenna by bribery and corruption; and that,   
finally, he made a bargain with Satan, promising him   
his soul after death, on condition that he (Satan)   
should put forth his great influence over the cardinals   
in such a manner as would secure his election to the   
throne of St. Peter. The arrangement was carried into   
successful operation. Sylvester, the monks averred,   
consulted the Devil through the medium of a brazen   
head during his whole reign, and enjoyed his faithful   
friendship and unwavering patronage. But, when His   
Holiness came to die, he endeavored to defraud Satan   
<pb n="340" id="vI340"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1385">   
<figDesc>Page 340.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of his rightful claim to his soul, by repenting, and acknowledging his sin. This illustrates the way in which   
the popular idea of the Devil was used to awaken ridicule and gratify malignity.</p>

<div3 type="segment"><head></head>  
<p>The natural and ultimate effect of the diffusion of   
Christianity was to overthrow, or rather to revolutionize, the whole system of incantation and sorcery.</p>   
<p>In heathen countries, as in the East at present and   
with those among us who profess to hold communications with spirits, no reproach or sentiment of   
disapprobation, as has already been observed, was   
necessarily connected with the arts of divination; for   
the supernatural beings with whom intercourse was   
alleged to be had were not, with a few exceptions, regarded as evil beings. The persons who were thought   
to be skilful in their use were, on the contrary, held   
in great esteem, and looked upon with reverence.   
Magicians and philosophers were convertible and   
synonymous terms. Learned and scientific men were   
induced to encourage, and turn to their own advantage, the popular credulity that ascribed their extraordinary skill to their connection with spiritual and   
divine beings. At length, however, they found themselves placed in a very uncomfortable predicament by   
the prevalence of the new theology. It was exceedingly difficult to dispel the delusion, and correct   
the error they had previously found it for their interest to perpetuate in the minds of the community.   
They could not convince them that their knowledge   
was acquired from natural sources, or their operations   
<pb n="341" id="vI341"/>

conducted solely by the aid of natural causes and   
laws. The people would not surrender the belief, that   
the results of scientific experiments, and the accuracy   
of predictions of physical phenomena, were secured   
by the assistance of supernatural beings.</p>   
<p>As the doctrines of the gospel gradually undermined   
the popular belief in other spiritual beings inferior   
to the Deity, and were at the same time supposed to   
teach the existence and extensively diffused energy   
of an almost infinite and omnipotent agent of evil, it   
was exceedingly natural, nay, it necessarily followed,   
that the credulity and superstition which had led   
to the supposition of an alliance between philosophers and spiritual beings should settle down into a   
full conviction that the Devil was the being with whom   
they were thus confederated. The consequence was   
that they were charged with witchcraft, and many fell   
victims to the general prejudice and abhorrence occasioned by the imputation. The influence of this state   
of things was soon seen: it was one of the most   
effectual causes of the rapid diffusion of knowledge   
in modern times. Philosophers and men of science   
became as anxious to explain and publish their discoveries as they had been in former ages to conceal   
and cover them with mystery. The following instances will be sufficient to illustrate the correctness   
of these views.</p>   
<p>In the thirteenth century, Roger Bacon was charged   
with witchcraft on account of his discoveries in optics,   
chemistry, and astronomy; and, although he did what   
<pb n="342" id="vI342"/>

<figDesc>Page 342.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
he could to circulate and explain his own acquirements, he could not escape a papal denunciation, and   
two long and painful imprisonments. In 1305, Arnold   
de Villa Nova, a learned physician and philosopher,   
was burned at Padua, by order of inquisitors, on the   
charge of witchcraft. He was eighty years of age.   
Ten years afterwards, Peter Apon, also of Padua, who   
had made extraordinary progress in knowledge, was   
accused of the same crime, and condemned to death,   
but expired previous to the time appointed for his execution.</p>   
<p>I will now present a brief sketch of the most noticeable facts relating to the subject in Europe and   
Great Britain previous to the close of the seventeenth   
century. Some writers have computed that thirty   
thousand persons were executed for this supposed   
crime, within one hundred and fifty years. It will   
of course be in my power to mention only a few instances.</p>   
<p>In 1484, Pope Innocent the Eighth issued a bull   
encouraging and requiring the arrest and punishment   
of persons suspected of witchcraft. From this moment, the prosecutions became frequent and the victims numerous in every country. The very next year,   
forty-one aged females were consigned to the flames   
in one nation; and, not long after, a hundred were   
burned by one inquisition in the devoted valleys of   
Piedmont; forty-eight were burned in Ravensburg in   
five years; and, in the year 1515, five hundred were   
burned at Geneva in three months! One writer declares   
<pb n="343" id="vI343"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1388">   
<figDesc>Page 343.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that &ldquo;almost an infinite number&rdquo; were burned   
for witchcraft in France, &mdash; a thousand in a single   
diocese! These sanguinary and horrible transactions   
were promoted and sanctioned by theological hatred   
and rancor. It was soon perceived that there was no   
kind of difficulty in clearing the Church of heretics   
by hanging or burning them all as witches! The imputation of witchcraft could be fixed upon any one   
with the greatest facility. In the earlier part of the   
fifteenth century, the Earl of Bedford, having taken   
the celebrated Joan of Arc prisoner, put her to death   
on this charge. She had been almost adored by the   
people rescued by her romantic valor, and was universally known among them by the venerable title of   
&ldquo;Holy Maid of God;&rdquo; but no difficulty was experienced in procuring evidence enough to lead her to the   
stake as a servant and confederate of Satan! Luther   
was just beginning his attack upon the papal power,   
and he was instantly accused of being in confederacy   
with the Devil.</p>   
<p>In 1534, Elizabeth Barton, &ldquo;the Maid of Kent,&rdquo;   
was executed for witchcraft in England, together with   
seven men who had been confederate with her. In   
1541 the Earl of Hungerford was beheaded for inquiring of a witch how long Henry VIII. would live.   
In 1549 it was made the duty of bishops, by Archbishop Cranmer's articles of visitation, to inquire of   
their clergy, whether &ldquo;they know of any that use   
charms, sorcery, enchantments, witchcraft, soothsaying, or any like craft invented by the Devil.&rdquo; In 1563   
<pb n="344" id="vI344"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1389">   
<figDesc>Page 344.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the King of Sweden carried four witches with him, as   
a part of his armament, to aid him in his wars with   
the Danes. In 1576, seventeen or eighteen were condemned in Essex, in England. A single judge or inquisitor, Remigius, condemned and burned nine hundred within fifteen years, from 1580 to 1595, in the   
single district of Lorraine; and as many more fled out   
of the country; whole villages were depopulated, and   
fifteen persons destroyed themselves rather than submit to the torture which, under the administration   
of this successor of Draco and rival of Jeffries, was   
the first step taken in the trial of an accused person.   
The application of the rack and other instruments of   
torment, in the examination of prisoners, was recommended by him in a work on witchcraft. He observes   
that &ldquo;scarcely any one was known to be brought to   
repentance and confession but by these means&rdquo;!</p>   
<p>The most eminent persons of the sixteenth century   
were believers in the popular superstition respecting   
the existence of compacts between Satan and human   
beings, and in the notions associated with it. The excellent Melancthon was an interpreter of dreams and   
caster of nativities. Luther was a strenuous supporter of the doctrine of witchcraft, and seems to have   
seriously believed that he had had frequent interviews   
with the arch-enemy himself, and had disputed with   
him on points of theology, face to face. In his &ldquo;Table,&rdquo; he gives the following account of his intimacy   
with the Devil: speaking of his confinement in the   
Castle of Wartburg, he says, &ldquo;Among other things   
<pb n="345" id="vI345"/>

<figDesc>Page 345.</figDesc>

they brought me hazel-nuts, which I put into a box,   
and sometimes I used to crack and cat of them. In   
the night-times, my gentleman, the Devil, came and   
got the nuts out of the box, and cracked them against   
one of the bedposts, making a very great noise and   
rumbling about my bed; but I regarded him nothing   
at all: when afterwards I began to slumber, then he   
kept such a racket and rumbling upon the chamber   
stairs, as if many empty barrels and hogsheads had   
been tumbled down.&rdquo; Kepler, whose name is immortalized by being associated with the laws he discovered   
that regulate the orbits of the heavenly bodies, was   
a zealous advocate of astrology; and his great predecessor and master, the Prince of Astronomers, as he   
is called, Tycho Brache, kept an idiot in his presence,   
fed him from his own table, with his own hand, and   
listened to his incoherent, unmeaning, and fatuous expressions as to a revelation from the spiritual world.</p>   
<p>The following is the language addressed to Queen   
Elizabeth by Bishop Jewell. He was one of the most   
learned persons of his age, and is to this day regarded   
as the mighty champion of the Church of England,   
and of the cause of the Reformation in Great Britain.   
He was the terrible foe of Roman-Catholic superstition. &ldquo;It may please Your Grace,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to   
understand that witches and sorcerers within these   
four last years are marvellously increased within Your   
Grace's realm; Your Grace's subjects pine away even   
unto the death; their color fadeth, their flesh rotteth,   
their speech is benumbed, their senses are bereft. I

pray God,&rdquo; continues the courtly preacher, &ldquo;they   
never practise further than upon the subject.&rdquo; The   
petition of the polite prelate appears to have been   
answered. The virgin queen resisted inexorably the   
arts of all charmers, and is thought never to have   
been bewitched in her life.</p>   
<p>It is probable that Spenser, in his &ldquo;Fa&euml;rie Queen,&rdquo;   
has described with accuracy the witch of the sixteenth   
century in the following beautiful lines: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;There, in a gloomy hollow glen, she found</l>   
<l rend="indent">A little cottage built of sticks and weedes,</l>   
<l rend="indent">In homely wise, and wald with sods around,</l>   
<l rend="indent">In which a witch did dwell in loathly weedes</l>   
<l rend="indent">And wilful want, all careless of her needes;</l>   
<l rend="indent">So choosing solitarie to abide</l>   
<l rend="indent">Far from all neighbors, that her devilish deedes</l>   
<l rend="indent">And hellish arts from people she might hide,</l>   
<l>And hurt far off unknowne whomever she envide.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>So prone were some to indulge in the contemplation of the agency of the Devil and his myrmidons, that   
they strained, violated, and perverted the language of   
Scripture to make it speak of them. Thus they insisted that the word &ldquo;Philistines&rdquo; meant confederates   
and subjects of the Devil, and accordingly interpreted   
the expression, &ldquo;I will deliver you into the hands of   
the Philistines,&rdquo; thus, &ldquo;I will deliver you into the   
hands of demons.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>I cannot describe the extent to which the superstition we are reviewing was carried about the close of   
the sixteenth century in stronger language than the   
following, from a candid and learned French Roman   
<pb n="347" id="vI347"/>

historian: &ldquo;So great folly,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;did   
then oppress the miserable world, that Christians believed greater absurdities than could ever be imposed   
upon the heathens.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>We have now arrived at the commencement of the   
seventeenth century, within which the prosecutions for   
witchcraft took place in Salem. To show the opinions   
of the clergy of the English Church at this time, I   
will quote the following curious canon, made by the   
convocation in 1603: &mdash;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;That no minister or ministers, without license and   
direction of the bishop, under his hand and seal obtained, attempt, upon any pretence whatsoever, either   
of possession or obsession, by fasting and prayer, to   
cast out any devil or devils, under pain of the imputation of imposture or cozenage, and deposition from the   
ministry.&rdquo; In the same year, licenses were actually   
granted, as required above, by the Bishop of Chester;   
and several ministers were duly authorized by him to   
cast out devils!</p>   
<p>During this whole century, there were trails and   
executions for witchcraft in all civilized countries.   
More than two hundred were hanged in England,   
thousands were burned in Scotland, and still larger   
numbers in various parts of Europe.</p>   
<p>Edward Fairfax, the poet, was one of the most accomplished men in England. He is celebrated as the   
translator of Tasso's &ldquo;Jerusalem Delivered,&rdquo; in allusion to which work Collins thus speaks of him: &mdash;</p>   
<pb n="348" id="vI348"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1393">   
<figDesc>Page 348.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;How have I sate, while piped the pensive wind,</l>   
<l rend="indent">To hear thy harp, by British Fairfax strung,</l>   
<l>Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind</l>   
<l rend="indent">Believed the magic wonders that he sung.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>This same Fairfax prosecuted six of his neighbors   
for bewitching his children. The trials took place   
about the time the first pilgrims came to America.</p>   
<p>In 1634, Urbain Grandier, a very learned and eminent French minister, rendered himself odious to the   
bigoted nuns of Loudun, by his moderation towards   
heretics. Secretly instigated, as has been supposed, by   
Cardinal Richelieu, against whom he had written a   
satire, they pretended to be bewitched by him, and procured his prosecution: he was tortured upon the rack   
until he swooned, and then was burned at the stake.   
In 1640, Dr. Lamb, of London, was murdered in the   
streets of that city by the mob, on suspicion of witchcraft. Several were hanged in England, only a few   
years before the proceedings commenced in Salem.   
Some were tried by water ordeal, and drowned in the   
process, in Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire, at the very time the executions were   
going on here; and a considerable number of capital   
punishments took place in various parts of Great Britain, some years after the prosecution had ceased in   
America.</p>   
<p>The trials and executions in England and Scotland   
were attended by circumstances as painful, as barbarous, and in all respects as disgraceful, as those occurring in Salem. Every species of torture seems to

have been resorted to: the principles of reason, justice,   
and humanity were set at defiance, and the whole body   
of the people kept in a state of the most fierce excitement against the sufferers. Indeed, there is nothing more distressing in the contemplation of these   
sanguinary proceedings than the spirit of deliberate   
and unmitigated cruelty with which they were conducted. No symptoms of pity, compassion, or sympathy, appear to have been manifested by the judges or   
the community. The following account of the expenses attending the execution of two persons convicted of witchcraft in Scotland, shows in what a cool,   
business-like style the affair was managed: &mdash;</p>

<p>The brutalizing effects of capital punishments are   
clearly seen in these, as in all other instances. They   
gradually impart a feeling of indifference to the value   
of human life, or to the idea of cutting it off by the   
hand of violence, to all who become accustomed to   
the spectacle. In various ways they exercise influences upon the tone and temper of society, which cannot

but be regarded with regret by the citizen, the   
legislator, the moralist, the philanthropist, and the   
Christian.</p>   
<p>Sinclair, in his work called &ldquo;Satan's Invisible World   
Discovered,&rdquo; gives the following affecting declaration   
made by one of the confessing witches, as she was on   
her way to the stake: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Now all you that see me this day know that I am now   
to die as a witch by my own confession; and I free all men,   
especially the ministers and magistrates, of the guilt of my   
blood; I take it wholly upon myself, my blood be upon   
my own head: and, as I must make answer to the God of   
heaven presently, I declare I am as free of witchcraft as   
any child; but, being delated by a malicious woman, and put   
in prison under the name of a witch, disowned by my husband and friends, and seeing no ground of hope of my coming out of prison, or ever coming in credit again, through the   
temptation of the Devil, I made up that confession on purpose   
to destroy my own life, being weary of it, and choosing rather   
to die than live.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Sir George Mackenzie says that he went to examine   
some women who had confessed, and that one of them,   
who was a silly creature, told him, &ldquo;under secresie,&rdquo;   
&ldquo;that she had not confessed because she was guilty,   
but, being a poor creature, who wrought for her   
meat, and being defamed for a witch, she knew she   
would starve, for no person thereafter would either   
give her meat or lodging, and that all men would beat   
her, and hound dogs at her, and that therefore she   
<pb n="351" id="vI351"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1396">   
<figDesc>Page 351.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
desired to be out of the world.&rdquo; Whereupon she wept   
most bitterly, and, upon her knees, called God to witness to what she said.</p>   
<p>A wretch, named Matthew Hopkins, rendered himself infamously conspicuous in the prosecutions for   
witchcraft that took place in the counties of Essex,   
Sussex, Norfolk, and Huntingdon, in England, in the   
years 1645 and 1646. The title he assumed indicates   
the part he acted: it was &ldquo;Witch-finder-general.&rdquo; He   
travelled from place to place; his expenses were paid;   
and he required, in addition, regular fees for the discovery of a witch. Besides pricking the body to find   
the witch-mark, he compelled the wretched and decrepit victims of his cruel practices to sit in a painful posture, on an elevated stool, with their limbs   
crossed; and, if they persevered in refusing to confess,   
he would prolong their torture, in some cases, to more   
than twenty-four hours. He would prevent their going   
to sleep, and drag them about barefoot over the rough   
ground, thus overcoming them with extreme weariness   
and pain: but his favorite method was to tie the thumb   
of the right hand close to the great toe of the left foot,   
and draw them through a river or pond; if they floated,   
as they would be likely to do, while their heavier limbs   
were thus sustained and upborne by the rope, it was   
considered as conclusive proof of their guilt. This   
monster was encouraged and sanctioned by the government; and he procured the death, in one year   
and in one county, of more than three times as many   
as suffered in Salem during the whole delusion. He   
<pb n="352" id="vI352"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1397">   
<figDesc>Page 352.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and his exploits are referred to in the following lines,   
from that storehouse of good sense and keen wit,   
Butler's &ldquo;Hudibras:&rdquo; &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;Hath not this present Parliament</l>   
<l>A leiger to the Devil sent,</l>   
<l>Fully empowered to freat about</l>   
<l>Finding revolted witches out?</l>   
<l>And has he not within a year</l>   
<l>Hanged threescore of them in one shire?&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>The infatuated people looked upon this Hopkins with   
admiration and astonishment, and could only account   
for his success by the supposition, which, we are told,   
was generally entertained, that he had stolen the   
memorandum-book in which Satan had recorded the   
names of all the persons in England who were in league   
with him!</p>   
<p>The most melancholy circumstance connected with   
the history of this creature is, that Richard Baxter and   
Edmund Calamy &mdash; names dear and venerable in the   
estimation of all virtuous and pious men &mdash; were deceived and deluded by him: they countenanced his   
conduct, followed him in his movements, and aided   
him in his proceedings.</p>   
<p>At length, however, some gentlemen, shocked at the   
cruelty and suspicious of the integrity of Hopkins,   
seized him, tied his thumbs and toes together, threw   
him into a pond, and dragged him about to their hearts'   
content. They were fully satisfied with the result of   
the experiment. It was found that he did not sink.   
He stood condemned on his own principles; and thus   
<pb n="353" id="vI353"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1398">   
<figDesc>Page 353.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the country was rescued from the power of the malicious impostor.</p>   
<p>Among the persons whose death Hopkins procured,   
was a venerable, gray-headed clergyman, named Lewis.   
He was of the Church of England, had been the minister of a congregation for more than half a century,   
and was over eighty years of age. His infirm frame   
was subjected to the customary tests, even to the trial   
by water ordeal: he was compelled to walk almost   
incessantly for several days and nights, until, in   
the exhaustion of his nature, he yielded assent to a   
confession that was adduced against him in Court;   
which, however, he disowned and denied there and   
at all times, from the moment of release from the   
torments, by which it had been extorted, to his last   
breath. As he was about to die the death of a felon,   
he knew that the rites of sepulture, according to the   
forms of his denomination, would be denied to his   
remains. The aged sufferer, it is related, read his   
own funeral service while on the scaffold. Solemn,   
sublime, and affecting as are passages of this portion   
of the ritual of the Church, surely it was never performed under circumstances so well suited to impress   
with awe and tenderness as when uttered by the calumniated, oppressed, and dying old man. Baxter had   
been tried for sedition, on the ground that one of his   
publications contained a reflection upon Episcopacy,   
and was imprisoned for two years. It is a striking and   
melancholy illustration of the moral infirmity of human nature, that the author of the &ldquo;Saints' Everlasting   
<pb n="354" id="vI354"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1399">   
<figDesc>Page 354.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Rest,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Call to the Unconverted,&rdquo; permitted such a vengeful feeling against the Establishment to enter his breast, that he took pleasure, and   
almost exulted, in relating the fate of this innocent   
and aged clergyman, whom he denominates, in derision, a &ldquo;Reading Parson.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Baxter's writings are pervaded by his belief in all   
sorts of supernatural things. In the &ldquo;Saints' Everlasting Rest,&rdquo; he declares his conviction of the reality   
and authenticity of stories of ghosts, apparitions,   
haunted houses, &amp;c. He placed full faith in a tale,   
current among the people of his day, of the &ldquo;dispossession of the Devil out of many persons together in a   
room in Lancashire, at the prayer of some godly ministers.&rdquo; In his &ldquo;Dying Thoughts,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I have   
had many convincing proofs of witches, the contracts   
they have made with devils, and the power which they   
have received from them;&rdquo; and he seems to have   
credited the most absurd fables ever invented on the   
subject by ignorance, folly, or fraud.</p>   
<p>The case to which he refers, as one of the &ldquo;dispossession of devils,&rdquo; may be found in a tract published   
in London in 1697, entitled, &ldquo;The Surey Demoniac;   
or, an Account of Satan's strange and dreadful actings, in and about the body of Richard Dugdale, of   
Surey, near Whalley, in Lancashire. And how he was   
dispossessed by God's blessing on the Fastings and   
Prayers of divers Ministers and People. The matter   
of fact attested by the oaths of several creditable persons, before some of his Majestie's Justices of the Peace   
<pb n="355" id="vI355"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1400">   
<figDesc>Page 355.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in the said county.&rdquo; The &ldquo;London Monthly Repository&rdquo; (vol. v., 1810) describes the affair as follows:   
&ldquo;These dreadful actings of Satan continued above a   
year; during which there was a desperate struggle between him and nine ministers of the gospel, who had   
undertaken to cast him out, and, for that purpose, successively relieved each other in their daily combats with   
him: while Satan tried all his arts to baffle their attempts, insulting them with scoffs and raillery, puzzling   
them sometimes with Greek and Latin, and threatening   
them with the effects of his vengeance, till he was finally   
vanquished and put to flight by the persevering prayers   
and fastings of the said ministers.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>No name in English history is regarded with more   
respect and admiration, by wise and virtuous men, than   
that of Sir Matthew Hale. His character was almost   
venerated by our ancestors; and it has been thought   
that it was the influence of his authority, more than   
any thing else, that prevailed upon them to pursue the   
course they adopted in the prosecutions at Salem.   
This great and good man presided, as Lord Chief Baron,   
at the trial of two females, &mdash; Amy Dunny and Rose   
Cullendor, &mdash; at Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, in the   
year 1664. They were convicted and executed.</p>   
<p>Baxter relates the following circumstance as having   
occurred at this trial: &ldquo;A godly minister, yet living,   
sitting by to see one of the girls (who appeared as a   
witness against the prisoners) in her fits, suddenly felt   
a force pull one of the hooks from his breeches; and,   
while he looked with wonder at what was become   
<pb n="356" id="vI356"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1401">   
<figDesc>Page 356.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of it, the tormented girl vomited it up out of her   
mouth.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>To give an idea of the nature of the testimony upon   
which the principal stress was laid by the government,   
I will extract the following passages from the report of   
the trial: &ldquo;Robert Sherringham testified that the axletree of his cart, happening, in passing, to break some   
part of Rose Cullender's house, in her anger at it, she   
vehemently threatened him his horses should suffer   
for it; and, within a short time, all his four horses   
died; after which he sustained many other losses, in   
the sudden dying of his cattle. He was also taken   
with a lameness in his limbs, and so far vexed with   
lice of an extraordinary number and bigness, that no   
art could hinder the swarming of them, till he burned   
up two suits of apparel.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Margaret Arnold testified   
that Amy Dunny afflicted her children: they (the   
children), she said, would see mice running round the   
house, and, when they caught them and threw them   
into the fire, they would screech out like rats.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;A   
thing like a bee flew at the face of the younger child;   
the child fell into a fit, and at last vomited up a two nail, with a broad head, affirming that the bee   
brought this nail, and forced it into her mouth.&rdquo; &mdash;   
&ldquo;She one day caught an invisible mouse, and, throwing it into the fire, it flashed like to gunpowder. None   
besides the child saw the mouse, but every one saw the   
flash!&rdquo;</p>   
<p>In this instance we perceive the influence of prejudice in perverting evidence. The circumstance that   
<pb n="357" id="vI357"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1402">   
<figDesc>Page 357.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the mouse was invisible to all eyes but those of the   
child ought to have satisfied the Court and jury that   
she was either under the power of a delusion or practising an imposture. But, as they were predisposed to   
find something supernatural in the transaction, their   
minds seized upon the pretended invisibility of the   
mouse as conclusive proof of diabolical agency.</p>   
<p>Many persons who were present expressed the opinion, that the issue of the trial would have been favorable to the prisoners, had it not been for the following   
circumstance: Sir Thomas Browne, a physician, philosopher, and scholar of unrivalled celebrity at that   
time, happened to be upon the spot; and it was the   
universal wish that he should be called to the stand,   
and his opinion be obtained on the general subject of   
witchcraft. An enthusiastic contemporary admirer   
of Sir Thomas Browne thus describes him: &ldquo;The   
horizon of his understanding was much larger than   
the hemisphere of the world: all that was visible   
in the heavens he comprehended so well, that few   
that are under them knew so much; and of the earth   
he had such a minute and exact geographical knowledge as if he had been by Divine Providence ordained   
surveyor-general of the whole terrestrial globe and its   
products, minerals, plants, and animals.&rdquo; His memory is stated to have been inferior only to that of   
Seneca or Scaliger; and he was reputed master of seven   
languages. Dr. Johnson, who has written his biography, sums up his character in the following terms:   
&ldquo;But it is not on the praises of others, but on his   
<pb n="358" id="vI358"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1403">   
<figDesc>Page 358.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
own writings, that he is to depend for the esteem of   
posterity, of which he will not easily be deprived,   
while learning shall have any reverence among men:   
for there is no science in which he does not discover   
some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane   
or sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not   
appear to have cultivated with success.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was considered by those of his   
own generation to have made great advances beyond   
the wisdom of his age. He claimed the character of   
a reformer, and gave to his principal publication the   
title of an &ldquo;Enquiry into Vulgar Errors.&rdquo; So bold   
and free were his speculations, that he was looked   
upon invidiously by many as a daring innovator, and   
did not escape the denunciatory imputation of heresy.   
Nothing could be more unjust, however, than this   
latter charge. He was a most ardent and zealous   
believer in the doctrines of the Established Church.   
He declares &ldquo;that he assumes the honorable style of   
a Christian,&rdquo; not because &ldquo;it is the religion of his   
country,&rdquo; but because, &ldquo;having in his riper years and   
confirmed judgment seen and examined all, he finds   
himself obliged, by the principles of grace and the   
law of his own reason, to embrace no other name but   
this.&rdquo; He exults and &ldquo;blesses himself, that he lived   
not in the days of miracles, when faith had been   
thrust upon him, but enjoys that greater blessing pronounced to all that believed, and saw not:&rdquo; nay, he   
goes so far as to say, that they only had the advantage &ldquo;of a bold and noble faith, who lived before the   
<pb n="359" id="vI359"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1404">   
<figDesc>Page 359.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
coming of the Saviour, and, upon obscure prophecies   
and mystical types, could raise a belief.&rdquo; The fact   
that such a man was accused of infidelity is an affecting proof of the injustice that is sometimes done by   
the judgment of contemporaries.</p>   
<p>This prodigy of learning and philosophy went into   
Court, took the stand, and declared his opinion in   
favor of the reality of witchcraft, entered into a particular discussion of the subject before the jury, threw   
the whole weight of his great name into the wavering   
scales of justice, and the poor women were convicted.   
The authority of Sir Thomas Browne, added to the   
other evidence, perplexed Sir Matthew Hale. A reporter of the trial says, &ldquo;that it made this great and   
good man doubtful; but he was in such fears, and proceeded with such caution, that he would not so much   
as sum up the evidence, but left it to the jury with   
prayers, `that the great God of heaven would direct   
their hearts in that weighty matter.&rdquo;'</p>   
<p>The result of this important trial established decisively the interpretation of English law; and the   
printed report of it was used as an authoritative textbook in the Court at Salem.</p>   
<p>The celebrated Robert Boyle flourished in the latter   
half of the seventeenth century. He is allowed by   
all to have done much towards the introduction of an   
improved philosophy, and the promotion of experimental science. But he could not entirely shake off   
the superstition of his age.</p>   
<p>A small city in Burgundy, called Mascon, was   
<pb n="360" id="vI360"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1405">   
<figDesc>Page 360.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
famous in the annals of witchcraft. In a work called   
&ldquo;The Theatre of God's Judgments,&rdquo; published, in   
London, by Thomas Beard in 1612, there is the following passage: &ldquo;It was a very lamentable spectacle   
that chanced to the Governor of Mascon, a magician,   
whom the Devil snatched up in dinner-while, and   
hoisted aloft, carrying him three times about the town   
of Mascon, in the presence of many beholders, to whom   
he cried in this manner, `Help, help, my friends!' so   
that the whole town stood amazed thereat; yea, and   
the remembrance of this strange accident sticketh at   
this day fast in the minds of all the inhabitants of   
this country.&rdquo; A malicious and bigoted monk, who   
discharged the office of chief legend-maker to the   
Benedictine Abbey, in the vicinity of Mascon, fabricated this ridiculous story for the purpose of bringing   
the Governor into disrepute. An account of another   
diabolical visitation, suggested, it is probable, by the   
one just described, was issued from the press, under   
the title of &ldquo;The Devil of Mascon,&rdquo; during the lifetime   
of Boyle, who gave his sanction to the work, promoted its version into English, and, as late as 1678,   
publicly declared his belief of the supernatural transaction it related.</p>   
<p>The subject of demonology, in all its forms and   
phases, embracing witchcraft, held a more commanding place throughout Europe, in the literature of the   
centuries immediately preceding the eighteenth, than   
any other. Works of the highest pretension, elaborate,   
learned, voluminous, and exhausting, were published,   
<pb n="361" id="vI361"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1406">   
<figDesc>Page 361.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
by the authority of governments and universities, to   
expound it. It was regarded as occupying the most   
eminent department of jurisprudence, as well as of science and theology.</p>   
<p>Raphael De La Torre and Adam Tanner published   
treatises establishing the right and duty of ecclesiastical tribunals to punish all who practised or dealt   
with the arts of demonology. In 1484, Sprenger came   
out with his famous book, &ldquo;Malleus Maleficarum;&rdquo;   
or, the &ldquo;Hammer of Witches.&rdquo; Paul Layman, in   
1629, issued an elaborate work on &ldquo;Judicial Processes against Sorcerers and Witches.&rdquo; The following   
is the title of a bulky volume of some seven hundred   
pages: &ldquo;Demonology, or Natural Magic or demoniacal, lawful and unlawful, also open or secret, by the   
intervention and invocation of a Demon,&rdquo; published in   
1612. It consists of four books, treating of the crime   
of witchcraft, and its punishment in the ordinary tribunals and the Inquisitorial office. Its author was   
Don Francisco Torreblanca Villalpando, of Cordova,   
Advocate Royal in the courts of Grenada. It was   
republished in 1623, by command of Philip III. of   
Spain, on the recommendation of the Fiscal General,   
and with the sanction of the Royal Council and the   
Holy Inquisition. This work may be considered as   
establishing and defining the doctrines, in reference   
to witchcraft, prevailing in all Catholic countries.   
It was indorsed by royal, judicial, academical, and   
ecclesiastical approval; is replete with extraordinary   
erudition, arranged in the most scientific form, embracing   
<pb n="362" id="vI362"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1407">   
<figDesc>Page 362.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
in a methodical classification all the minutest   
details of the subject, and codifying it into a complete   
system of law. There was no particular in all the   
proceedings and all the doctrines brought out at the   
trials in Salem, which did not find ample justification and support in this work of Catholic, imperial,   
and European authority.</p>   
<p>But perhaps the writer of the greatest influence on   
this subject in England and America, during the whole   
of the seventeenth century, was William Perkins, &ldquo;the   
learned, pious, and painful preacher of God's Word, at   
St. Andrew's, in Cambridge,&rdquo; where he died, in 1602,   
aged forty-four years. He was quite a voluminous   
author; and many of his works were translated into   
French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish. Fuller, in &ldquo;The   
Holy State,&rdquo; selects him as the impersonation of the   
qualities requisite to &ldquo;the Faithful Minister.&rdquo; In his   
glowing eulogium upon his learning and talents, he   
says: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;He would pronounce the word <hi rend="italics">damne</hi> with such an emphasis as left a doleful echo in his auditors' ears a good while   
after. And, when catechist of Christ's College, in expounding the Commandments, applied them so home, &mdash; able almost to make his hearers' hearts fall down, and hairs to stand   
upright. But, in his older age, he altered his voice, and   
remitted much of his former rigidness, often professing that   
to preach mercy was that proper office of the ministers of the   
gospel.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Our Perkins brought the schools into the pulpit,   
and, unshelling their controversies out of their hard school, made thereof plain and wholesome meat for his people;   
<pb n="363" id="vI363"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1408">   
<figDesc>Page 363.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
for he had a capacious head, with angles winding, and   
roomy enough to lodge all controversial intricacies.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;He   
had a rare felicity in speedy reading of books; so that, as it   
were, riding post through an author, he took strict notice of   
all passages. Perusing books so speedily, one would think he   
read nothing; so accurately, one would think he read all.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>An octavo volume, written by this great scholar and   
divine, was published at Cambridge in England, under   
the title, &ldquo;Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft.&rdquo; It went through several editions, and had a   
wide and permanent circulation.</p>   
<p>This work, the character of which is sufficiently indicated in its emphatic title, was the great authority on   
the subject with our fathers; and Mr. Parris had a copy   
of it in his possession when the proceedings in reference to witchcraft began at Salem Village.</p>   
<p>John Gaule published an octavo volume in London,   
in 1646, entitled, &ldquo;Select Cases of Conscience concerning Witches and Witchcraft.&rdquo; He is one of the most   
exact writers on the subject, and arranges witches in   
the following classes: &ldquo;1. The diviner, gypsy, or   
fortune-telling witch; 2. The astrologian, star-gazing,   
planetary, prognosticating witch; 3. The chanting,   
canting, or calculating witch, who works by signs and   
numbers; 4. The venefical, or poisoning witch; 5. The   
exorcist, or conjuring witch; 6. The gastronomic   
witch; 7. The magical, speculative, sciential, or arted   
witch; 8. The necromancer.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Besides innumerable writers of this class, who   
spread out the scholastic learning on the subject,   
<pb n="364" id="vI364"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1409">   
<figDesc>Page 364.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and presented it in a logical and theological form, there   
were others who treated it in a more popular style,   
and invested it with the charms of elegant literature.   
Henry Hallywell published an octavo in London, in   
1681, in which, while the main doctrines of witchcraft   
as then almost universally received are enforced, an   
attempt was made to divest it of some of its most repulsive and terrible features. He gives the following   
account of the means by which a person may place   
himself beyond the reach of the power of witchcraft: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;It is possible for the soul to arise to such a height, and   
become so divine, that no witchcraft or evil demons can have   
any power upon the body. When the bodily life is too far   
invigorated and awakened, and draws the intellect, the flower   
and summity of the soul, into a conspiration with it, then are   
we subject and obnoxious to magical assaults. For magic   
or sorcery, being founded only in this lower or mundane   
spirit, he that makes it his business to be freed and released   
from all its blandishments and flattering devocations, and   
endeavors wholly to withdraw himself from the love of corporeity and too near a sympathy with the frail flesh, he, by   
it, enkindles such a divine principle as lifts him above the   
fate of this inferior world, and adorns his mind with such an   
awful majesty that beats back all enchantments, and makes   
the infernal fiends tremble at his presence, hating those vigorous beams of light which are so contrary and repugnant   
to their dark natures.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The mind of this beautiful writer found encouragement and security in the midst of the diabolical spirits,   
<pb n="365" id="vI365"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1410">   
<figDesc>Page 365.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
with whom he believed the world to be infested, in   
the following views and speculations: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;For there is a chain of government that runs down from   
God, the Supreme Monarch, whose bright and piercing eyes   
look through all that he has made, to the lowest degree of the   
creation; and there are presidential angels of empires and   
kingdoms, and such as under them have the tutelage of private families; and, lastly, every man's particular guardian   
genius. Nor is the inanimate or material world left to blind   
chance or fortune; but there are, likewise, mighty and potent   
spirits, to whom is committed the guidance and care of the   
fluctuating and uncertain motions of it, and by their ministry, fire and vapor, storms and tempests, snow and hail, heat   
and cold, are all kept within such bounds and limits as are   
most serviceable to the ends of Providence. They take care   
of the variety of seasons, and superintend the tillage and fruits   
of the earth; upon which account, Origen calls them <hi rend="italics">invisible</hi>   
husbandmen. So that, all affairs and things being under the   
inspection and government of these incorporeal beings, the   
power of the dark kingdom and its agents is under a strict   
confinement and restraint; and they cannot bring a general   
mischief upon the world without a special permission of a   
superior Providence.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Spenser has the same imagery and sentiment: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;How oft do they their silver bowers leave,</l>   
<l>To come to succor us, that succor want?</l>   
<l>How oft do they with golden pinions cleave</l>   
<l>The flitting skies, like flying pursuivant,</l>   
<l>Against foul fiends to aid us militant?</l>   
<l>They for us fight, they watch and duly ward,</l>   
<l>And their bright squadrons round about us plant,</l>   
<l>And all for love and nothing for reward:</l>   
<l>Oh! why should heavenly God to man have such regard?&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>

<p>While there can be no doubt that the superstitious   
opinions we have been reviewing were diffused generally among the great body of the people of all ranks   
and conditions, it would be unjust to truth not to mention that there were some persons who looked upon   
them as empty fables and vain imaginations. Error   
has never yet made a complete and universal conquest.   
In the darkest ages and most benighted regions, it   
has been found impossible utterly to extinguish the   
light of reason. There always have been some in   
whose souls the torch of truth has been kept burning   
with vestal watchfulness: we can discern its glimmer   
here and there through the deepest night that has yet   
settled upon the earth. In the midst of the most extravagant superstition, there have been individuals who   
have disowned the popular belief, and considered it   
a mark of wisdom and true philosophy to discard the   
idle fancies and absurd schemes of faith that possessed   
the minds of the great mass of their contemporaries.   
This was the case with Horace, as appears from lines   
thus quite freely but effectively translated: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;These dreams and terrors magical,</l>   
<l>These miracles and witches,</l>   
<l>Night-walking spirites or Thessal bugs,</l>   
<l>Esteeme them not two rushes.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>The intellect of Seneca also rose above the reach   
of the popular credulity with respect to the agency of   
supernatural beings and the efficacy of mysterious   
charms.</p>   
<p>If we could but obtain access to the secret thoughts   
<pb n="367" id="vI367"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1412">   
<figDesc>Page 367.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of the wisest philosophers and of the men of genius   
of antiquity, we should probably find that many of   
them were superior to the superstitions of their times.   
Even in the thick darkness of the dark ages, there   
were minds too powerful to be kept in chains by error   
and delusion.</p>   
<p>Henry Cornelius Agrippa, who was born in the   
latter part of the fifteenth century, was, perhaps,   
the greatest philosopher and scholar of his period.   
In early life, he was very much devoted to the science of magic, and was a strenuous supporter of   
demonology and witchcraft. In the course of his   
studies and meditations, he was led to a change of   
views on these subjects, and did all that he could to   
warn others from putting confidence in such vain,   
frivolous, and absurd superstitions as then possessed   
the world. The consequence was, that he was denounced and prosecuted as a conjurer, and charged   
with having written against magic and witchcraft, in   
order the more securely to shelter himself from the   
suspicion of practising them. As an instance of the   
calumnies that were heaped upon him, I would mention that Paulus Jovius asserted that &ldquo;Cornelius   
Agrippa went always accompanied with an evil spirit   
in the similitude of a black dog;&rdquo; and that, when the   
time of his death drew near, &ldquo;he took off the enchanted   
collar from the dog's neck, and sent him away with   
these terms, `Get thee hence, thou cursed beast, which   
hast utterly destroyed me:' neither was the dog ever   
seen after.&rdquo; Butler, in his &ldquo;Hudibras,&rdquo; has not neglected   
<pb n="368" id="vI368"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1413">   
<figDesc>Page 368.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to celebrate this remarkable connection between   
Satan and the man of learning: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;Agrippa kept a Stygian pug</l>   
<l>I' th' garb and habit of a dog,</l>   
<l>That was his tutor; and the cur</l>   
<l>Read to th' occult philosopher.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>John Wierus wrote an elaborate, learned, and judicious book, in which he treated at large of magic, sorcery, and witchcraft, and did all that scholarship,   
talent, and philosophy could do to undermine and   
subvert the whole system of the prevailing popular   
superstition. But he fared no better than his predecessor, patron, and master, Agrippa; for, like him, he   
was accused of having attempted to persuade the world   
that there was no reality in supernatural charms and   
diabolical confederacies, in order that he might devote   
himself to them without suspicion or molestation, and   
was borne down by the bigotry and fanaticism of his   
times.</p>   
<p>King James merely gave utterance to the general   
sentiment, and pronounced the verdict of popular   
opinion, in the following extract from the preface to   
his &ldquo;Demonologie:&rdquo; &ldquo;Wierus, a German physician,   
sets out a public apologie for all these crafts-folkes,   
whereby, procuring for them impunitie, he plainly bewrays himself to have been of that profession.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>In 1584, a quarto volume was published in London,   
the work of Reginald Scott, a learned English gentleman, whose title sufficiently indicates its import, &ldquo;The   
Discovery of Witchcraft, wherein the lewde dealing of   
<pb n="369" id="vI369"/>

witches and witchmongers is notably detected; the   
knavery of conjurers, the impiety of inchanters, the   
folly of soothsayers, the impudent falsehood of cozeners, the infidelity of atheists, the pestilent practices of   
pythonists, the curiosities of figure-casters, the vanity   
of dreamers, the beggarly art of alcumstrie, the abomination of idolatrie, the horrible art of poisoning, the   
virtue and power of natural magic, and all the conveniencies of legerdemaine and juggling, are discovered, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>In 1599, Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York,   
wrote a work, published in London, to expose certain   
persons who pretended to have the power of casting out   
devils, and detecting their &ldquo;deceitful trade.&rdquo; This   
writer was among the first to bring the power of bold   
satire and open denunciation to bear against the superstitions of demonology. He thus describes the motives and the methods of such impostors: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Out of these,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;is shaped us the true idea of   
a witch, &mdash; an old, weather-beaten crone, having her chin   
and her knees meeting for age, walking like a bow, leaning   
on a staff; hollow-eyed, untoothed, furrowed on her face,   
having her limbs trembling with the palsy, going mumbling   
in the streets; one that hath forgotten her Pater-noster, and   
yet hath a shrewd tongue to call a drab a drab. If she   
hath learned of an old wife, in a chimney-end, Pax, Max,   
Fax, for a spell, or can say Sir John Grantham's curse for   
the miller's eels, `All ye that have stolen the miller's eels,   
Laudate dominum de c&oelig;lis: and all they that have consented   
thereto, Benedicamus domino:' why then, beware! look about

you, my neighbors. If any of you have a sheep sick of the   
giddies, or a hog of the mumps, or a horse of the staggers, or   
a knavish boy of the school, or an idle girl of the wheel, or a   
young drab of the sullens, and hath not fat enough for her   
porridge, or butter enough for her bread, and she hath a little   
help of the epilepsy or cramp, to teach her to roll her eyes,   
wry her mouth, gnash her teeth, startle with her body, hold   
her arms and hands stiff, &amp;c.; and then, when an old Mother   
Nobs hath by chance called her an idle young housewife, or   
bid the Devil scratch her, then no doubt but Mother Nobs is   
the witch, and the young girl is owl blasted, &amp;c. They that   
have their brains baited and their fancies distempered with   
the imaginations and apprehensions of witches, conjurers, and   
fairies, and all that lymphatic chimera, I find to be marshalled in one of these five ranks: children, fools, women,   
cowards, sick or black melancholic discomposed wits.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>In 1669, a work was published in London with the   
following title: &ldquo;The Question of Witchcraft Debated;   
or, a Discourse against their Opinions that affirm   
Witches.&rdquo; It is a work of great merit, and would do   
honor to a scholar and logician of the present day.   
The author was John Wagstaffe, of Oxford University:   
he is described as a crooked, shrivelled, little man, of   
a most despicable appearance. This circumstance, together with his writings against the popular belief in   
witchcraft, led his academical associates to accuse him,   
some of them in sport, but others with grave suspicion,   
of being a wizard. Wood, the historian of Oxford,   
says that &ldquo;he died in a manner distracted, occasioned   
by a deep conceit of his own parts, and by a continual   
<pb n="371" id="vI371"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1416">   
<figDesc>Page 371.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
bibbing of strong and high-tasted liquors.&rdquo; But poor   
Wagstaffe was assailed by something more than private raillery and slander. His heretical sentiments   
exposed him to the battery of the host of writers who   
will always be found ready to advocate a prevailing   
opinion. But Wagstaffe was not left entirely alone to   
defend the cause of reason and truth. He had one   
most zealous advocate and ardent admirer in the   
author of a work on &ldquo;The Doctrine of Devils,&rdquo; published in 1676. This writer sums up a panegyric   
upon Wagstaffe's performance, by pronouncing it &ldquo;a   
judicious book, that contains more good reason, true   
religion, and right Christianity, than all those lumps   
and cartloads of luggage that hath been fardled up   
by all the faggeters of demonologistical winter-tales,   
and witchcraftical legendaries, since they first began to   
foul clean paper.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Dr. Balthasar Bekker, of Amsterdam, who was   
equally eminent in astronomy, philosophy, and theology, published in 1691 a learned and powerful work,   
called &ldquo;The World Bewitched,&rdquo; in which he openly   
assailed the doctrines of witchcraft and of the Devil,   
and anticipated many of the views and arguments presented in Farmer's excellent publications. As a reward for his exertions to enlighten his fellow-creatures,   
he was turned out of the ministry, and assaulted by   
nearly all the writers of his age.</p>   
<p>Dr. Bekker was one of the ablest and boldest writers   
of his day, and did much to advance the cause of natural science, scriptural interpretation, and the principles   
<pb n="372" id="vI372"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1417">   
<figDesc>Page 372.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of enlightened Christianity. In 1680 he published   
an &ldquo;Inquiry concerning Comets,&rdquo; rescuing them from   
the realm of superstition, placing them within the natural physical laws, and exploding the then-received   
opinion, that, in any way, they are the presages or forerunners of evil. His &ldquo;Exposition on the Prophet   
Daniel&rdquo; gives proof of his learning and judgment.   
His great merits were recognized by John Locke and   
Richard Bentley. In the preface to his &ldquo;World Bewitched,&rdquo; he says, that it grieved him to see the great   
honors, powers, and miracles which are ascribed to the   
Devil. &ldquo;It has come to that pass,&rdquo; to use his own language, &ldquo;that men think it piety and godliness to ascribe a great many wonders to the Devil, and impiety   
and heresy, if a man will not believe that the Devil can   
do what a thousand persons say he does. It is now   
reckoned godliness, if a man who fears God fear also   
the Devil. If he be not afraid of the Devil, he passes   
for an atheist, who does not believe in God, because   
he cannot think that there are two gods, the one good,   
the other bad. But these, I think, with much more   
reason, may be called ditheists. For my part, if, on   
account of my opinion, they will give me a new name,   
let them call me a monotheist, a believer of but one   
God.&rdquo; The work struck down the whole system of   
demonology and witchcraft, by proving that there never   
was really such a thing as sorcery or possession, and   
that devils have no influence over human affairs or the   
persons of men. It is not surprising that it raised a   
great clamor. The wonder is that it did not cost him   
<pb n="373" id="vI373"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1418">   
<figDesc>Page 373.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
his life. It is probable that his protection was the confidence the people had in his character and learning.   
Attempts were made to diminish that confidence, and   
bring him into odium, by levelling against him every   
form of abuse. A medal was struck, and extensively   
circulated, representing the Devil, clothed like a minister or priest, riding on an ass. The device was so   
arranged as to excite ridicule and abhorrence, in the   
vulgar mind, against Bekker. But it was found impossible to turn the popular feeling, which had set in   
his favor; and his-persecutors and defamers were completely baffled. He was followed, soon after, by the   
learned Thomasius, whose writings against demonology produced a decided effect upon the convictions of   
the age.</p>   
<p>While Bekker, and the other writers of his class,   
endeavored to overthrow the superstitious practices   
and fancies then prevalent respecting demonology and   
communications with spiritual beings, they so far acceded to the popular theology as to maintain the doctrine of the personality of the Devil. They believed in   
the existence of the arch-fiend, but denied his agency   
in human affairs. They held that he was kept confined   
&ldquo;to bottomless perdition, there to dwell &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;In adamantine chains and penal fire.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Sir Robert Filmer, in 1680, published &ldquo;An Advertisement to the jurymen of England, touching Witches,&rdquo;   
in which he criticised and condemned many of the opinions and methods then countenanced on the subject.</p>   
<pb n="374" id="vI374"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1419">   
<figDesc>Page 374.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>But Bekker, Thomasius, and Filmer appeared too   
late to operate upon the prevalent opinions of Europe   
or America prior to the witchcraft delusion of 1692.   
The productions of the other writers, in the same direction, to whom I have referred, probably had a very   
limited circulation, and made at the time but little impression. Error is seldom overthrown by mere reasoning. It yields only to the logic of events. No power of   
learning or wit could have rooted the witchcraft superstitions out of the minds of men. Nothing short of a   
demonstration of their deformities, follies, and horrors,   
such as here was held up to the view of the world, could   
have given their death-blow. This was the final cause   
of Salem Witchcraft, and makes it one of the great   
landmarks in the world's history.</p>   
<p>A full and just view of the position and obligations   
of the persons who took part in the transactions   
at Salem requires a previous knowledge of the principles and the state of the law, as it was then in force   
and understood by the courts, and all concerned in   
judicial proceedings. Although the ancients did not   
regard pretended intercourse between magicians and   
enchanters and spiritual beings as necessarily or always criminal, we find that they enacted laws against   
the abuse of the power supposed to result from the   
connection. The old Roman code of the Twelve Tables   
contained the following prohibition: &ldquo;That they should   
not bewitch the fruits of the earth, nor use any charms   
to draw their neighbor's corn into their own fields.&rdquo;   
There were several special edicts on the subject during   
<pb n="375" id="vI375"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1420">   
<figDesc>Page 375.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the existence of the Roman State. In the early Christian councils, sorcery was frequently made the object   
of denunciation. At Laodicea, for instance, in the   
year 364, it was voted to excommunicate any clergymen who were magicians, enchanters, astrologers, or   
mathematicians! The Bull of Pope Innocent VIII.,   
near the close of the fifteenth century, has already   
been mentioned.</p>   
<p>Dr. Turner, in his history of the Anglo-Saxons,   
says that they had laws against sorcerers and witches,   
but that they did not punish them with death. There   
was an English statute against witchcraft, in the reign   
of Henry VIII., and another in that of Elizabeth.</p>   
<p>Up to this time, however, the legislation of parliament on the subject was merciful and judicious: for   
it did not attach to the guilt of witchcraft the punishment of death, unless it had been used to destroy life:   
that is, unless it had become murder.</p>   
<p>On the demise of Elizabeth, James of Scotland   
ascended the throne. His pedantie and eccentric   
character is well known. He had an early and decided   
inclination towards abstruse or mysterious speculations. Before he had reached his twentieth year, he   
undertook to accomplish what only the most sanguine   
and profound theologians have ever dared to attempt:   
he expounded the Book of Revelation. When he was   
about twenty-five years of age, he published a work   
on the &ldquo;Doctrine of Devils and Witchcraft.&rdquo; Not   
long after, he succeeded to the British crown. It may   
easily be imagined that the subject of demonology   
<pb n="376" id="vI376"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1421">   
<figDesc>Page 376.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
soon became a fashionable and prevailing topic of   
conversation in the royal saloons and throughout the   
nation. It served as a medium through which obsequious courtiers could convey their flattery to the   
ears of their accomplished and learned sovereign. His   
Majesty's book was reprinted and extensively circulated. It was of course praised and recommended   
in all quarters.</p>   
<p>The parliament, actuated by a base desire to compliment the vain and superstitious king, enacted a   
new and much more severe statute against witchcraft,   
in the very first year of his reign. It was under this   
law that so many persons here and in England were   
deprived of their lives. The blood of hundreds of   
innocent persons was thus unrighteously shed. It was   
a fearful price which these servile lawgivers paid for   
the favor of their prince.</p>   
<p>But this was not the only mischief brought about   
by courtly deference to the prejudices of King James.   
It was under his direction that our present translation of the Scriptures was made. To please His   
Royal Majesty, and to strengthen the arguments in   
his work on demonology, the word &ldquo;witch&rdquo; was   
used to represent expressions in the original Hebrew,   
that conveyed an entirely different idea; and it was   
freely inserted in the headings of the chapters.<note target="v1n2">*</note> A person having &ldquo;a familiar spirit&rdquo; was a favorite description of a witch in the king's book. The translators,   
<pb n="377" id="vI377"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1422">   
<figDesc>Page 377.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
forgetful of their high and solemn function,   
endeavored to establish this definition by inserting it   
into their version. Accordingly, they introduced it in   
several places; in the eleventh verse of the eighteenth   
chapter of Deuteronomy, for instance, &ldquo;a consulter   
with familiar spirits.&rdquo; There is no word in the Hebrew which corresponds with &ldquo;familiar.&rdquo; And this is   
the important, the essential word in the definition. It   
conveys the idea of alliance, stated connection, confederacy, or compact, which is characteristic and distinctive of a witch. The expression in the original   
signifies &ldquo;a consulter with spirits,&rdquo; &mdash; especially, as   
was the case with the &ldquo;Witch of Endor,&rdquo; a consulter   
with departed spirits. It was a shocking perversion   
of the word of God, for the purpose of flattering a   
frail and mortal sovereign! King James lived to see   
and acknowledge the error of his early opinions, and   
he would gladly have counteracted their bad effect;   
but it is easier to make laws and translations than   
it is to alter and amend them.</p>   
<p>While the law of the land required the capital   
punishment of witches, no blame ought to be attached   
to judges and jurors for discharging their respective   
duties in carrying it into execution. It will not do   
for us to assert, that they ought to have refused, let   
the consequences to themselves have been what they   
would, to sanction and give effect to such inhuman and   
unreasonable enactments. We cannot consistently take   
this ground; for there is nothing more certain than   
that, with their notions, our ancestors had at least as   
<pb n="378" id="vI378"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1423">   
<figDesc>Page 378.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
good reasons to advance in favor of punishing witchcraft with death, as we have for punishing any crime   
whatsoever in the same awful and summary manner.   
We appeal, in defence of our capital punishments, to   
the text of Moses, &ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by   
man shall his blood be shed.&rdquo; The apologist of our   
fathers, for carrying into effect the law making witch a capital offence, tells us in reply, in the first   
place, that this passage is not of the nature of a precept, but merely of an admonition; that it does not   
enjoin any particular method of proceeding, but simply   
describes the natural consequences of cruel and contentious conduct; and that it amounts only to this:   
that quarrelsome, violent, and bloodthirsty persons will   
be apt to meet the same fate they bring upon others;   
that the duellist will be likely to fall in private combat,   
the ambitious conqueror to perish, and the warlike   
nation to be destroyed, on the field of battle. If this   
is not considered by us a sufficient and satisfactory   
answer, he advances to our own ground, points to the   
same text where we place our defence, and puts his   
finger on the following plain and authoritative precept: &ldquo;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&rdquo; Indeed   
we must acknowledge, that the capital punishment of   
witches is as strongly supported and fortified by the   
Scriptures of the Old Testament &mdash; at least, as they   
appear in our present version &mdash; as the capital punishment of any crime whatever.</p>   
<p>If we adopt another line of argument, and say that   
it is necessary to punish some particular crimes with   
<pb n="379" id="vI379"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1424">   
<figDesc>Page 379.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
death, in order to maintain the security of society,   
or hold up an impressive warning to others, here also   
we find that our opponent has full as much to offer in   
defence of our fathers as can be offered in our own   
defence. He describes to us the tremendous and infernal power which was universally believed by them   
to be possessed by a witch; a power which, as it was   
not derived from a natural source, could not easily be   
held in check by natural restraints: neither chains   
nor dungeons could bind it down or confine it. You   
might load the witch with irons, you might bury her   
in the lowest cell of a feudal prison, and still it was   
believed that she could send forth her imps or her   
spectre to ravage the fields, and blight the meadows,   
and throw the elements into confusion, and torture   
the bodies, and craze the minds, of any who might be   
the objects of her malice.</p>   
<p>Shakspeare, in the description which he puts into   
the mouth of Macbeth of the supernatural energy of   
witchcraft, does not surpass, if he does justice to, the   
prevailing belief on the subject: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;I conjure you, by that which you profess,</l>   
<l>(Howe'er you came to know it) answer me, &mdash;</l>   
<l>Though you untie the winds, and let them fight</l>   
<l>Against the churches; though the yesty waves</l>   
<l>Confound and swallow navigation up;</l>   
<l>Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down;</l>   
<l>Though castles topple on their warders' heads;</l>   
<l>Though palaces and pyramids do slope</l>   
<l>Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure</l>   
<l>Of nature's germins tumble all together,</l>   
<l>Even till destruction sicken, &mdash; answer me</l>   
<l>To what I ask you.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<pb n="380" id="vI380"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1425">   
<figDesc>Page 380.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>There was indeed an almost infinite power to do   
mischief associated with a disposition to do it. No   
human strength could strip the witch of these mighty   
energies while she lived; nothing but death could   
destroy them. There was, as our ancestors considered, incontestable evidence, that she had put them   
forth to the injury, loss, and perhaps death, of others.</p>   
<p>Can it be wondered at, that, under such circumstances, the law connecting capital punishment with   
the guilt of witchcraft was resorted to as the only   
means to protect society, and warn others from entering into the dark, wicked, and malignant compact?</p>   
<p>It is not probable that even King James's Parliament   
would have been willing to go to the length of Selden   
in his &ldquo;Table-Talk,&rdquo; who takes this ground in defence   
of the capital punishment of witches. &ldquo;The law   
against witches does not prove there be any, but it   
punishes the malice of those people that use such   
means to take away men's lives. If one should profess,   
that, by turning his hat thrice and crying `Buzz,' he   
could take away a man's life (though in truth he could   
do no such thing), yet this were a just law made by   
the State, that whoever should turn his hat thrice   
and cry `Buzz,' with an intention to take away a man's   
life, shall be put to death.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>There are other considerations that deserve to be   
weighed before a final judgment should be made up   
respecting the conduct of our fathers in the witchcraft delusion. Among these is the condition of physical science in their day. But little knowledge of the   
<pb n="381" id="vI381"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1426">   
<figDesc>Page 381.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
laws of nature was possessed, and that little was confined to a few. The world was still, to the mass of   
the people, almost as full of mystery in its physical   
departments as it was to its first inhabitants. Politics, poetry, rhetoric, ethics, and history had been   
cultivated to a great extent in previous ages; but the   
philosophy of the natural and material world was   
almost unknown. Astronomy, chemistry, optics, pneumatics, and even geography, were involved in the general darkness and error. Some of our most important   
sciences, such as electricity, date their origin from a   
later period.</p>   
<p>This remarkable tardiness in the progress of physical   
science for some time after the era of the revival of   
learning is to be accounted for by referring to the   
erroneous methods of reasoning and observation then   
prevalent in the world. A false logic was adopted in   
the schools of learning and philosophy. The great   
instrument for the discovery and investigation of truth   
was the syllogism, the most absurd contrivance of the   
human mind; an argumentative process whose conclusion is contained in the premises; a method of   
proof, in the first step of which the matter to be   
proved is taken for granted.<note target="v1n3">*</note> In a word, the whole   
system of philosophy was made up of hypotheses, and   
<pb n="382" id="vI382"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1427">   
<figDesc>Page 382.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the only foundation of science was laid in conjecture.   
The imagination, called necessarily into extraordinary   
action, in the absence of scientific certainty, was still   
further exercised in vain attempts to discover, unassisted by observation and experiment, the elements   
and first principles of nature. It had reached a monstrous growth about the time to which we are referring. Indeed it may be said, that all the intellectual   
productions of modern times, from the seventeenth   
century back to the dark ages, were works of imagination. The bulkiest and most voluminous writings   
that proceeded from the cloisters or the universities,   
even the metaphysical disquisitions of the Nominalists   
and Realists, and the boundless subtleties of the contending schools of the &ldquo;Divine Doctors,&rdquo; Thomas   
Aquinas and Duns Scotus, fall under this description.   
Dull, dreary, unintelligible, and interminable as they   
are, they are still in reality works of fancy. They are   
the offspring, almost exclusively, of the imaginative   
faculty. It ought not to create surprise, to find that   
this faculty predominated in the minds and characters   
of our ancestors, and developed itself to an extent   
beyond our conception, when we reflect that it was   
almost the only one called into exercise, and that it   
was the leading element of every branch of literature   
and philosophy.</p>

</p>   
<p>It is true, that, in the earlier part of the seventeenth   
century, Lord Bacon made his sublime discoveries in   
the department of physical science. By disclosing the   
true method of investigation and reasoning on such   
subjects, he may be said to have found, or rather to   
have invented, the key that unlocked the hitherto unopened halls of nature. He introduced man to the   
secret chambers of the universe, and placed in his   
hand the thread by which he has been conducted to   
the magnificent results of modern science, and will undoubtedly be led on to results still more magnificent   
in times to come. But it was not for human nature   
to pass in a moment from darkness to light. The   
transition was slow and gradual: a long twilight intervened before the sun shed its clear and full radiance upon the world.</p>   
<p>The great discoverer himself refused to admit, or   
was unable to discern, some of the truths his system   
had revealed. Bacon was numbered among the opponents of the Copernican or true system of astronomy   
to the day of his death; so also was Sir Thomas   
Browne, the great philosopher already described, and   
who flourished during the latter half of the same century. Indeed, it may be said, that, at the time of the   
witchcraft delusion, the ancient empire of darkness   
which had oppressed and crushed the world of science   
had hardly been shaken. The great and triumphant   
progress of modern discovery had scarcely begun.</p>   
<p>I shall now proceed to illustrate these views of the   
state of science in the world at that time by presenting   
<pb n="384" id="vI384"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1429">   
<figDesc>Page 384.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
a few instances. The slightest examination of the   
accounts which remain of occurrences deemed supernatural by our ancestors will satisfy any one that   
they were brought about by causes entirely natural,   
although unknown to them. For instance, the following circumstances are related by the Rev. James   
Pierpont, pastor of a church in New Haven, in a letter to Cotton Mather, and published by him in his   
&ldquo;Magnalia:&rdquo;<note target="v1n4">*</note> &mdash;</p>   
<p>In the year 1646, a new ship, containing a valuable   
cargo, and having several distinguished persons on   
board as passengers, put to sea from New Haven in   
the month of January, bound to England. The vessels that came over the ensuing spring brought no   
tidings of her arrival in the mother-country. The   
pious colonists were earnest and instant in their   
prayers that intelligence might be received of the   
missing vessel. In the month of June, 1648, &ldquo;a   
great thunder-storm arose out of the north-west;   
after which (the hemisphere being serene), about an   
hour before sunset, a ship of like dimensions with the   
aforesaid, with her canvas and colors abroad (although   
<pb n="385" id="vI385"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1430">   
<figDesc>Page 385.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the wind was northerly), appeared in the air, coming   
up from the harbor's mouth, which lies southward   
from the town, &mdash; seemingly with her sails filled under   
a fresh gale, holding her course north, and continuing   
under observation, sailing against the wind for the   
space of half an hour.&rdquo; The phantom-ship was borne   
along, until, to the excited imaginations of the spectators, she seemed to have approached so near that they   
could throw a stone into her. Her main-topmast then   
disappeared, then her mizzen-topmast; then her masts   
were entirely carried away; and, finally, her hull fell   
off, and vanished from sight, &mdash; leaving a dull and   
smoke-colored cloud, which soon dissolved, and the   
whole atmosphere became clear. All affirmed that   
the airy vision was a precise copy and image of the   
missing vessel, and that it was sent to announce and   
describe her fate. They considered it the spectre of   
the lost ship; and the Rev. Mr. Davenport declared in   
public, &ldquo;that God had condescended, for the quieting   
their afflicted spirits, this extraordinary account of his   
sovereign disposal of those for whom so many fervent   
prayers were made continually.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The results of modern science enable us to explain   
the mysterious appearance. It is probable that some   
Dutch vessel, proceeding slowly, quietly, and unconsciously on her voyage from Amsterdam to the New

through the Sound. At the moment the apparition   
was seen in the sky, she was so near, that her reflected   
image was painted or delineated, to the eyes of the

observers, on the clouds, by laws of optics now generally well known, before her actual outlines could be   
discerned by them on the horizon. As the sun sunk   
behind the western hills, and his rays were gradually   
withdrawn, the visionary ship slowly disappeared; and   
the approach of night effectually concealed the vessel   
as she continued her course along the Sound.</p>   
<p>The optical illusions that present themselves on the   
sea-shore, by which distant objects are raised to view,   
the opposite capes and islands made to loom up, lifted   
above the line of the apparent circumference of the   
earth, and thrown into every variety of shape which   
the imagination can conceive, are among the most   
beautiful phenomena of nature; and they impress the   
mind with the idea of enchantment and mystery, more   
perhaps than any others: but they have received a   
complete solution from modern discovery.</p>   
<p>It should be observed, that the optical principles   
which explain these phenomena have recently afforded   
a foundation for the science, or rather art, of nauscopy; and there are persons in some places, &mdash; in the   
Isle of France, as I have been told, &mdash; whose calling   
and profession is to ascertain and predict the approach   
of vessels, by their reflection in the atmosphere and on   
the clouds, long before they are visible to the eye, or   
through the glass.</p>   
<p>The following opinion prevailed at the time of our   
narrative. The discoveries in electricity, itself a   
recent science, have rendered it impossible for us to   
contemplate it without ridicule. But it was the sober   
<pb n="387" id="vI387"/>

opinion of the age. &ldquo;A great man has noted it,&rdquo; says   
a learned writer, &ldquo;that thunders break oftener on   
churches than any other houses, because demons have   
a peculiar spite at houses that are set apart for the   
peculiar service of God.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Every thing that was strange or remarkable &mdash; every   
thing at all out of the usual course, every thing that   
was not clear and plain &mdash; was attributed to supernatural interposition. Indeed, our fathers lived, as   
they thought, continually in the midst of miracles; and   
felt themselves surrounded, at all times, in all scenes,   
with innumerable invisible beings. The beautiful   
verse of Milton describes their faith: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth</l>   
<l>Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>What was to him, however, a momentary vision of   
the imagination, was to them like a perpetual perception of the senses: it was a practical belief, an everyday common sentiment, an all-pervading feeling. But   
these supernatural beings very frequently were believed   
to have become visible to our superstitious ancestors.   
The instances, indeed, were not rare, of individuals   
having seen the Devil himself with their mortal eyes.   
They may well be brought to notice, as illustrating the   
ideas which then prevailed, and had an immediate,   
practical effect on the conduct of men, in reference to   
the power, presence, and action of the Devil in human   
affairs. This, in fact, is necessary, that we may understand the narrative we are preparing to contemplate of   
transactions based wholly on those ideas.</p>

<p>The following passage is extracted from a letter   
written to Increase Mather by the Rev. John Higginson: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The godly Mr. Sharp, who was ruling elder of the   
church of Salem almost thirty years after, related it of himself, that, being bred up to learning till he was eighteen years   
old, and then taken off, and put to be an apprentice to a   
draper in London, he yet notwithstanding continued a strong   
inclination and eager affection to books, with a curiosity of   
hearkening after and reading of the strangest and oddest   
books he could get, spending much of his time that way to   
the neglect of his business. At one time, there came a man   
into the shop, and brought a book with him, and said to him,   
`Here is a book for you, keep this till I call for it again;'   
and so went away. Mr. Sharp, after his wonted bookish   
manner, was eagerly affected to look into that book, and read   
it, which he did: but, as he read in it, he was seized on by   
a strange kind of horror, both of body and mind, the hair of   
his head standing up; and, finding these effects several times,   
he acquainted his master with it, who, observing the same   
effects, they concluded it was a conjuring book, and resolved   
to burn it, which they did. He that brought it in the shape   
of a man never coming to call for it, they concluded it was   
the Devil. He, taking this as a solemn warning from God   
to take heed what books he read, was much taken off from   
his former bookishness; confining himself to reading the   
Bible, and other known good books of divinity, which were   
profitable to his soul.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Kircher relates the following anecdote, with a full   
belief of its truth: He had a friend who was zealously and perseveringly devoted to the study of alchemy.   
<pb n="389" id="vI389"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1434">   
<figDesc>Page 389.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
At one time, while he was intent upon his   
operations, a gentleman entered his laboratory, and   
kindly offered to assist him. In a few moments, a   
large mass of the purest gold was brought forth from the   
crucible. The gentleman then took his hat, and went   
out: before leaving the apartment, however, he wrote   
a recipe for making the precious article. The grateful   
and admiring mortal continued his operations, according to the directions of his visitor; but the charm was   
lost: he could not succeed, and was at last completely   
ruined by his costly and fruitless experiments. Both   
he and his friend Kircher were fully persuaded that   
the mysterious stranger-visitor was the Devil.</p>   
<p>Baxter has recorded a curious interview between   
Satan and Mr. White, of Dorchester, assessor to the   
Westminster Assembly: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The Devil, in a light night, stood by his bedside.   
The assessor looked a while, whether he would say or   
do any thing, and then said, `If thou hast nothing to   
do, I have;' and so turned himself to sleep.&rdquo; Dr. Hibbert is of opinion, that the Rev. Mr. White treated his   
satanic majesty, on this occasion, with &ldquo;a cool contempt, to which he had not often been accustomed.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Indeed, there is nothing more curious or instructive,   
in the history of that period, than the light which it   
sheds upon the influence of the belief of the personal   
existence and operations of the Devil, when that belief   
is carried out fully into its practical effects. The   
Christian doctrine had relapsed into a system almost   
identical with Manicheism. Wierus thus describes   
<pb n="390" id="vI390"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1435">   
<figDesc>Page 390.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Satan, as he was regarded in the prevalent theology:   
&ldquo;He possesses great courage, incredible cunning, superhuman wisdom, the most acute penetration, consummate prudence, an incomparable skill in veiling the   
most pernicious artifices under a specious disguise,   
and a malicious and infinite hatred towards the human   
race, implacable and incurable.&rdquo; Milton merely responded to the popular sentiment in making Satan a   
character of lofty dignity, and in placing him on an   
elevation not &ldquo;less than archangel ruined.&rdquo; Hallywell, in his work on witchcraft, declares that &ldquo;that   
mighty angel of darkness is not foolishly nor idly to   
be scoffed at or blasphemed. The Devil,&rdquo; says he,   
&ldquo;may properly be looked upon as a dignity, though his   
glory be pale and wan, and those once bright and orient   
colors faded and darkened in his robes; and the Scriptures represent him as a prince, though it be of devils.&rdquo;   
Although our fathers cannot be charged with having   
regarded the Devil in this respectful and deferential   
light, it must be acknowledged that they gave him a   
conspicuous and distinguished &mdash; we might almost say   
a dignified &mdash; agency in the affairs of life and the government of the world: they were prone to confess, if   
not to revere, his presence, in all scenes and at all   
times. He occupied a wide space, not merely in their   
theology and philosophy, but in their daily and familiar   
thoughts.<note target="v1n5">*</note></p>

<p>Cotton Mather, in one of his sermons, carries home   
this peculiar belief to the consciences of his hearers, in   
a manner that could not have failed to quicken and   
startle the most dull and drowsy among them.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;No place,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I know of, has got such a   
spell upon it as will always keep the Devil out. The   
meeting-house, wherein we assemble for the worship of God,   
is filled with many holy people and many holy concerns   
continually; but, if our eyes were so refined as the servant   
of the prophet had his of old, I suppose we should now see   
a throng of devils in this very place. The apostle has intimated that angels come in among us: there are angels, it   
seems, that hark how I preach, and how you hear, at this   
hour. And our own sad experience is enough to intimate   
that the devils are likewise rendezvousing here. It is reported in Job i. 5, `When the sons of God came to present   
themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among them.'   
When we are in our church assemblies, oh, how many devils,   
do you imagine, crowd in among us! There is a devil that   
rocks one to sleep. There is a devil that makes another to   
be thinking of, he scarcely knows what himself. And there   
is a devil that makes another to be pleasing himself with   
wanton and wicked speculations. It is also possible, that we   
have our closets or our studies gloriously perfumed with   
devotions every day; but, alas! can we shut the Devil out   
of them? No: let us go where we will, we shall still find a   
devil nigh unto us. Only when we come to heaven, we shall   
be out of his reach for ever.&rdquo;</p></q>

</p>   
<p>It is very remarkable, that such a train of thought   
as this did not suggest to the mind of Dr. Mather the   
true doctrine of the Bible respecting the Devil. One   
would have supposed, that, in carrying out the mode   
of speaking of him as a person to this extent, it would   
have occurred to him, that it might be that the scriptural expressions of a similar kind were also mere personifications of moral and abstract ideas. In describing   
the inattention, irreverence, and unholy reflections of   
his hearers as the operations of the Devil, it is wonderful that his eyes were not opened to discern the   
import of our Saviour's interpretation of the Parable   
of the Tares, in which he declares, that he understands   
by the Devil whatever obstructs the growth of virtue   
and piety in the soul, the causes that efface good impressions and give a wrong inclination to the thoughts   
and affections, such as &ldquo;the cares of this world&rdquo; or   
&ldquo;the deceitfulness of riches.&rdquo; By these are the tares   
planted, and by these is their growth promoted. &ldquo;The   
enemy that sowed them is the Devil.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Satan was regarded as the foe and opposer of all   
improvement in knowledge and civilization. The same   
writer thus quaintly expresses this opinion: He &ldquo;has   
hindered mankind, for many ages, from hitting those   
useful inventions which yet were so obvious and facile   
that it is everybody's wonder that they were not sooner   
hit upon. The bemisted world must jog on for thousands of years without the knowledge of the loadstone,   
till a Neapolitan stumbled upon it about three hundred years ago. Nor must the world be blessed with   
<pb n="393" id="vI393"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1438">   
<figDesc>Page 393.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
such a matchless engine of learning and virtue as that   
of printing, till about the middle of the fifteenth century. Nor could one old man, all over the face of the   
whole earth, have the benefit of such a little, though   
most needful, thing as a pair of spectacles, till a Dutchman, a little while ago, accommodated us. Indeed, as   
the Devil does begrudge us all manner of good, so he   
does annoy us with all manner of woe.&rdquo; In one of his   
sermons, Cotton Mather claimed for himself and his   
clerical brethren the honor of being particularly obnoxious to the malice of the Evil One. &ldquo;The ministers of God,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are more dogged by the Devil   
than other persons are.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Without a knowledge of this sentiment, the witchcraft delusion of our fathers cannot be understood.   
They were under an impression, that the Devil, having   
failed to prevent the progress of knowledge in Europe,   
had abandoned his efforts to obstruct it effectually   
there; had withdrawn into the American wilderness,   
intending here to make a final stand; and had resolved   
to retain an undiminished empire over the whole continent and his pagan allies, the native inhabitants.   
Our fathers accounted for the extraordinary descent   
and incursions of the Evil One among them, in 1692,   
on the supposition that it was a desperate effort to   
prevent them from bringing civilization and Christianity within his favorite retreat; and their souls were   
fired with the glorious thought, that, by carrying on the   
war with vigor against him and his confederates,   
the witches, they would become chosen and honored   
<pb n="394" id="vI394"/>

<figDesc>Page 394.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
instruments in the hand of God for breaking down and   
abolishing the last stronghold on the earth of the kingdom of darkness.</p>   
<p>That this opinion was not merely a conceit of their   
vanity, or an overweening estimate of their local importance, but a calm, deliberate conviction entertained   
by others as well as themselves, can be shown by   
abundant evidence from the literature of that period.   
I will quote a single illustration of the form in which   
this thought occupied their minds. The subject is   
worthy of being thoroughly appreciated, as it affords   
the key that opens to view the motives and sentiments   
which gave the mighty impetus to the witchcraft prosecution here in New England.</p>   
<p>Joseph Mede, B.D., Fellow of Christ's College, in   
Cambridge, England, died in 1638, at the age of fifty years. He was perhaps, all things considered,   
the most profound scholar of his times. His writings   
give evidence of a brilliant genius and an enlightened   
spirit. They were held in the highest esteem by his   
contemporaries of all denominations, and in all parts   
of Europe. He was a Churchman; but had, to a remarkable degree, the confidence of nonconformists.   
He entertained, as will appear by what follows, in the   
boldest form, the then prevalent opinions concerning   
diabolical agency and influence; but, at the same time,   
was singularly free from some of the worst traits of   
superstition and bigotry. His intimacy with the   
learned Dr. William Ames, and the general tone   
and tendency of his writings, naturally made him an   
<pb n="395" id="vI395"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1440">   
<figDesc>Page 395.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
authority with Protestants, particularly the Pilgrims   
and Puritans of New England. His posthumous writings, published in 1652, are exceedingly interesting.   
They contain fragments found among his papers, brief   
discussions of points of criticism, philosophy, and theology, and a varied correspondence on such subjects   
with eminent men of his day. Among his principal   
correspondents was Dr. William Twiss, himself a person of much ingenious learning, and whom John   
Norton, as we are told by Cotton Mather, &ldquo;loved and   
admired&rdquo; above all men of that age. The following   
passages between them illustrate the point before us.</p>   
<p>In a letter dated March 2, 1634, Twiss writes   
thus:&mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Now, I beseech you, let me know what your opinion is   
of our English plantations in the New World. Heretofore,   
I have wondered in my thoughts at the providence of God   
concerning that world; not discovered till this Old World   
of ours is almost at an end; and then no footsteps found of   
the knowledge of the true God, much less of Christ; and   
then considering our English plantations of late, and the   
opinion of many grave divines concerning the gospel's fleeting westward. Sometimes I have had such thoughts, Why   
may not <hi rend="italics">that</hi> be the place of the <hi rend="italics">New Jerusalem?</hi> But you   
have handsomely and fully cleared me from such odd conceits. But what, I pray? Shall our English there degenerate, and join themselves with Gog and Magog? We have   
heard lately divers ways, that our people there have no hope   
of the conversion of the natives. And, the very week after   
I received your last letter, I saw a letter, written from New   
<pb n="396" id="vI396"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1441">   
<figDesc>Page 396.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
England, discoursing of an impossibility of subsisting there;   
and seems to prefer the confession of God's truth in any   
condition here in Old England, rather than run over to   
enjoy their liberty there; yea, and that the gospel is like   
to be more dear in New England than in Old. And, lastly,   
unless they be exceeding careful, and God wonderfully merciful, they are like to lose that life and zeal for God and   
his truth in New England which they enjoyed in Old; as   
whereof they have already woful experience, and many   
there feel it to their smart.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Mr. Mede's answer was as follows:&mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Concerning our plantations in the American world,   
I wish them as well as anybody; though I differ from them   
far, both in other things, and on the grounds they go upon.   
And though there be but little hope of the general conversion of those natives or any considerable part of that continent, yet I suppose it may be a work pleasing to Almighty   
God and our blessed Saviour to affront the Devil with the   
sound of the gospel and the cross of Christ, in those places   
where he had thought to have reigned securely, and out of   
the din thereof; and, though we make no Christians there,   
yet to bring some thither to disturb and vex him, where   
he reigned without check.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;For that I may reveal my conceit further, though perhaps I cannot prove it, yet I think thus, &mdash; that those countries were first inhabited since our Saviour and his apostles'   
times, and not before; yea, perhaps, some ages after, there   
being no signs or footsteps found among them, or any monuments of older habitation, as there is with us.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;That the Devil, being impatient of the sound of the   
gospel and cross of Christ, in every part of this Old World,   
<pb n="397" id="vI397"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1442">   
<figDesc>Page 397.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
so that he could in no place be quiet for it; and foreseeing   
that he was like to lose all here; so he thought to provide   
himself of a seed over which he might reign securely, and   
in a place <foreign lang="unknown" rend="italics">ubi nec Pelopidarum facta neque nomen audiret.</foreign>   
That, accordingly, he drew a colony out of some of those   
barbarous nations dwelling upon the Northern Ocean (whither   
the sound of Christ had not yet come), and promising them   
by some oracle to show them a country far better than their   
own (which he might soon do), pleasant and large, where   
never man yet inhabited; he conducted them over those   
desert lands and islands (of which there are many in that   
sea) by the way of the north into America, which none   
would ever have gone, had they not first been assured there   
was a passage that way into a more desirable country.   
Namely, as when the world apostatized from the worship   
of the true God, God called Abraham out of Chaldee into   
the land of Canaan, of him to raise a seed to preserve a   
light unto his name: so the Devil, when he saw the world   
apostatizing from him, laid the foundations of a new kingdom, by deducting this colony from the north into America, where they have increased since into an innumerable   
multitude. And where did the Devil ever reign more abso   
lutely, and without control, since mankind first fell under   
his clutches?</p>   
<p>&ldquo;And here it is to be noted, that the story of the Mexican   
kingdom (which was not founded above four hundred years   
before ours came thither) relates, out of their own memorials and traditions, that they came to that place from the   
<hi rend="italics">north,</hi> whence their god, <hi rend="italics">Vitziliputzli,</hi> led them, going in   
an ark before them: and, after divers years' travel and   
many stations (like enough after some generations), they   
came to the place which the sign he had given them at   
<pb n="398" id="vI398"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1443">   
<figDesc>Page 398.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
their first setting-forth pointed out; where they were to   
finish their travels, build themselves a <hi rend="italics">city,</hi> and their god   
a <hi rend="italics">temple,</hi> which is the place where Mexico was built. Now,   
if the Devil were God's ape in <hi rend="italics">this,</hi> why might he not be   
likewise in bringing the first colony of men into that world   
out of ours? namely, by oracle, as God did Abraham out   
of Chaldee, whereto I before resembled it.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;But see the hand of Divine Providence. When the   
offspring of these <hi rend="italics">runagates</hi> from the sound of Christ's   
gospel had now replenished that other world, and began   
to flourish in those two kingdoms of Peru and Mexico,   
Christ our Lord sends his mastives, the Spaniards, to hunt   
them out, and worry them; which they did in so hideous   
a manner, as the like thereunto scarce ever was done since   
the sons of Noah came out of the ark. What an affront   
to the Devil was this, where he had thought to have reigned   
securely, and been for ever concealed from the knowledge   
of the followers of Christ!</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Yet the Devil perhaps is <hi rend="italics">less grieved</hi> for the loss of his   
servants by the <hi rend="italics">destroying</hi> of them, than he would be to lose   
them by the <hi rend="italics">saving</hi> of them; by which latter way, I doubt   
the Spaniards have despoiled him but of a few. What, then,   
if Christ our Lord will give him his <hi rend="italics">second affront</hi> with   
better Christians, which may be more grievous to him than   
the former? And, if Christ shall set him up a light in   
this manner to dazzle and torment the Devil at his own   
home, I hope they (viz., the Americans) shall not so far   
degenerate (not all of them) as to come into that army   
of Gog and Magog against the kingdom of Christ, but be   
translated thither before the Devil be loosed; if not, presently after his tying up.&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>Dr. Twiss, in a reply to the above, dated April 6,   
1635, thanks Mede for his letter, which he says he   
read &ldquo;with recreation and delight;&rdquo; and, particularly   
in reference to the &ldquo;peopling of the New World,&rdquo; he   
affirms that there is &ldquo;more in this letter of yours than   
formerly I have been acquainted with. Your conceit   
thereabouts, if I have any judgment, is grave and   
ponderous.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>This correspondence, while it serves as a specimen   
of the style of Mede, is a remarkable instance of the   
power of a sagacious intellect to penetrate through   
the darkness of theoretical and fanciful errors, and   
behold the truth that lies behind and beyond. The   
whole superstructure of the Devil, his oracles, and his   
schemes of policy and dominion, covers, in this brief   
familiar epistle, what is, I suppose, the theory most   
accredited at this day of the origin and traduction of   
the aboriginal races of America, proceeding from the   
nearest portions of the ancient continent on the North,   
and advancing down over the vast spaces towards Central and South America. The letter also foreshadows   
the decisive conflict which is here to be waged between   
the elements of freedom and slavery, between social   
and political systems that will rescue and exalt humanity, and those which depress and degrade it. In   
the phraseology of that age, it was to be determined   
whether &mdash; the Old World, in the language of Twiss,   
&ldquo;being almost at an end&rdquo; &mdash; a &ldquo;light&rdquo; should be   
&ldquo;set up&rdquo; here to usher in the &ldquo;kingdom of Christ,&rdquo;

<p>Our fathers were justified in feeling that this was the   
sense of their responsibility entertained by all learned   
men and true Christians in the Old World; and they   
were ready to meet and discharge it faithfully and   
manfully. They were told, and they believed, that it   
had fallen to their lot to be the champions of the cross   
of Christ against the power of the Devil. They felt,   
as I have said, that they were fighting him in his last   
stronghold, and they were determined to &ldquo;tie him up&rdquo;   
for ever.</p>   
<p>This is the true and just explanation of their general policy of administration, in other matters, as well   
as in the witchcraft prosecutions.</p>   
<p>The conclusion to which we are brought, by a review   
of the seventeenth century up to the period when the   
prosecutions took place here, is, that the witchcraft   
delusion pervaded the whole civilized world and every   
profession and department of society. It received the   
sanction of all the learned and distinguished English   
judges who flourished within the century, from Sir   
Edward Coke to Sir Matthew Hale. It was countenanced by the greatest philosophers and physicians,   
and was embraced by men of the highest genius and   
accomplishments, even by Lord Bacon himself. It was   
established by the convocation of bishops, and preached   
by the clergy. Dr. Henry More, of Christ's College,   
Cambridge, in addition to his admirable poetical and   
philosophical works, wrote volumes to defend it. It   
<pb n="401" id="vI401"/>

<figDesc>Page 401.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
was considered as worthy of the study of the most cultivated and liberal minds to discover and distinguish   
&ldquo;a true witch by proper trials and symptoms.&rdquo; The   
excellent Dr. Calamy has already been mentioned in   
this connection; and Richard Baxter wrote his work   
entitled &ldquo;The Certainty of the World of Spirits,&rdquo; for   
the special purpose of confirming and diffusing the   
belief. He kept up a correspondence with Cotton   
Mather, and with his father, Increase Mather, through   
the medium of which he stimulated and encouraged   
them in their proceedings against supposed witches in   
Boston and elsewhere. The divines of that day seem   
to have persuaded themselves into the belief that the   
doctrines of demonology were essential to the gospel,   
and that the rejection of them was equivalent to infidelity. A writer in one of our modern journals, in   
speaking of the prosecutions for witchcraft, happily   
and justly observes, &ldquo;It was truly hazardous to oppose those judicial murders. If any one ventured to   
do so, the Catholics burned him as a heretic, and the   
Protestants had a vehement longing to hang him for an   
atheist.&rdquo; The writings of Dr. More, of Baxter, Glanvil, Perkins, and others, had been circulating for a   
long time in New England before the trials began at   
Salem. It was such a review of the history of opinion   
as we have now made, which led Dr. Bentley to declare   
that &ldquo;the agency of invisible beings, if not a part of   
every religion, is not contrary to any one. It may   
be found in all ages, and in the most remote countries.   
It is then no just subject for our admiration, that a   
<pb n="402" id="vI402"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1447">   
<figDesc>Page 402.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
belief so alarming to our fears, so natural to our prejudices, and so easily abused by superstition, should   
obtain among our fathers, when it had not been rejected in the ages of philosophy, letters, and even   
revelation.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The works on demonology, the legal proceedings in   
prosecutions, and the phraseology of the people, gave   
more or less definite form to certain prominent points   
which may be summarily noticed. Several terms and   
expressions were employed to characterize persons   
supposed to be conversant with supernatural and magic   
art; such as diviner, enchanter, charmer, conjurer,   
necromancer, fortune-teller, soothsayer, augur, and   
sorcerer. These words are sometimes used as more   
or less synonymous, although, strictly speaking, they   
have meanings quite distinct. But none of them convey the idea attached to the name of witch. It was   
sometimes especially used to signify a female, while   
wizard was exclusively applied to a male. The distinction was not, however, often attempted to be made;   
the former title being prevailingly applied to either   
sex. A witch was regarded as a person who had made   
an actual, deliberate, formal compact with Satan, by   
which it was agreed that she should become his faithful subject, and do all in her power to aid him in   
his rebellion against God and his warfare against the   
gospel and church of Christ; and, in consideration of   
such allegiance and service, Satan, on his part, agreed   
to exercise his supernatural powers in her favor, and   
communicate to her those powers, in a greater or less   
<pb n="403" id="vI403"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1448">   
<figDesc>Page 403.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
degree, as she proved herself an efficient and devoted   
supporter of his cause. Thus, a witch was considered   
as a person who had transferred allegiance and worship   
from God to the Devil.</p>   
<p>The existence of this compact was supposed to confer great additional power on the Devil, as well as on   
his new subject; for the doctrine seems to have pervailed, that, for him to act with effect upon men,   
the intervention, instrumentality, and co-operation of   
human beings was necessary; and almost unlimited   
potency was ascribed to the combined exertions of   
Satan and those persons in league with him. A witch   
was believed to have the power, through her compact   
with the Devil, of afflicting, distressing, and rending   
whomsoever she would. She could cause them to pine   
away, throw them into the most frightful convulsions,   
choke, bruise, pierce, and craze them, subjecting them   
to every description of pain, disease, and torture, and   
even to death itself. She was believed to possess the   
faculty of being present, in her shape or apparition, at   
a different place, at any distance whatever, from that   
which her actual body occupied. Indeed, an indefinite   
amount of supernatural ability, and a boundless freedom and variety of methods for its exercise, were supposed to result from the diabolical compact. Those   
upon whom she thus exercised her malignant and   
mysterious energies were said to be bewitched.</p>   
<p>Beside these infernal powers, the alliance with Satan   
was believed to confer knowledge such as no other   
mortal possessed. The witch could perform the same   
<pb n="404" id="vI404"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1449">   
<figDesc>Page 404.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
wonders, in giving information of the things that belong to the invisible world, which is alleged in our   
day, by spirit-rappers, to be received through mediums.   
She could read inmost thoughts, suggest ideas to the   
minds of the absent, throw temptations in the path of   
those whom she desired to delude and destroy, bring   
up the spirits of the departed, and hear from them the   
secrets of their lives and of their deaths, and their   
experiences in the scenes of being on which they entered at their departure from this.</p>   
<p>When we consider that these opinions were not   
merely prevalent among the common people, but sanctioned by learning and philosophy, science and jurisprudence; that they possessed an authority, which   
but few ventured to question and had been firmly   
established by the convictions of centuries, &mdash; none can   
be surprised at the alarm it created, when the belief became current, that there were those in the community,   
and even in the churches, who had actually entered into   
this dark confederacy against God and heaven, religion   
and virtue; and that individuals were beginning to   
suffer from their diabolical power. It cannot be considered strange, that men looked with more than common horror upon persons against whom what was   
regarded as overwhelming evidence was borne of having engaged in this conspiracy with all that was evil,   
and this treason against all that was good.</p>   
<p>Elaborate works, scientific, philosophical, and judicial in their pretensions and reputation, &mdash; to some   
of which reference has been made, &mdash; defined and particularized   
<pb n="405" id="vI405"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1450">   
<figDesc>Page 405.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the various forms of evidence by which   
the crime of confederacy with Satan could be proved.</p>   
<p>It was believed that the Devil affixed his mark to   
the bodies of those in alliance with him, and that the   
point where this mark was made became callous and   
dead. The law provided, specifically, the means of   
detecting and identifying this sign. It required that   
the prisoner should be subjected to the scrutiny of   
a jury of the same sex, who would make a minute   
inspection of the body, shaving the head and handling   
every part. They would pierce it with pins; and if,   
as might have been expected, particularly in aged persons, any spot could be found insensible to the torture,   
or any excrescence, induration, or fixed discoloration,   
it was looked upon as visible evidence and demonstration of guilt. A physician or &ldquo;chirurgeon&rdquo; was   
required to be present at these examinations. In conducting them, there was liability to great roughness   
and unfeeling recklessness of treatment; and the whole   
procedure was barbarous and shocking to every just   
and delicate sensibility. There is reason to believe,   
that, in the trials here, there was more considerateness, humanity, and regard to a sense of decent   
propriety, than in similar proceedings in other countries, so far as this branch of the investigation is   
regarded.</p>   
<p>Another accredited field of evidence, recognized in   
the books and in legal proceedings, was as follows: It   
was believed, that, when witches found it inconvenient   
from any cause to execute their infernal designs upon   
<pb n="406" id="vI406"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1451">   
<figDesc>Page 406.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
those whom they wished to afflict by going to them in   
their natural human persons, they transformed themselves into the likeness of some animal, &mdash; a dog, hog,   
cat, rat, mouse, or toad; birds &mdash; particularly yellow   
birds &mdash; were often imagined to perform this service, as   
representing witches or the Devil. They also had   
imps under their control. These imps were generally   
supposed to bear the resemblance of some small insect, &mdash; such as a fly or a spider. The latter animal   
was prevailingly considered as most likely to act in   
this character. The accused person was closely   
watched, in order that the spider imp might be seen   
when it approached to obtain its nourishment, as it   
was thought to do, from the witchmark on the body of   
the culprit. Within the cells of a prison, spiders were,   
of course, often seen. Whenever one made its appearance, the guard attacked it with all the zeal and vehemence with which it was natural and proper to assault   
an agent of the Wicked One. If the spider was killed   
in the encounter, it was considered as an innocent   
animal, and all suspicion was removed from its character as the diabolical confederate of the prisoner;   
but if it escaped into a crack or crevice of the apartment, as spiders often do when assailed, all doubt of   
its guilty connection with the person accused of witchcraft was removed: it was set down as, beyond question or cavil, her veritable imp; and the evidence of   
her confederacy with Satan was thenceforward regarded   
as complete. The books of law and other learned   
writings, as well as the practice of courts in the old   
<pb n="407" id="vI407"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1452">   
<figDesc>Page 407.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
countries, recognized this doctrine of transformation   
into the shapes of animals, and the employment of   
imps. Where judicial tribunals countenanced the   
popular credulity in maintaining these ideas, there   
was no security for innocence, and no escape from   
wrong. No matter how clear and certain the evidence   
adduced, that an accused individual, at the time alleged, was absent from the specified place; no matter   
how far distant, whether twenty or a thousand miles,   
it availed him nothing; for it was charged that he was   
present, and acted through his agent or imp. This   
notion was further enlarged by the establishment of   
the additional doctrine, that a witch could be present,   
and act with demoniac power upon her victims, anywhere, at all times, and at any distance, without the   
instrumental agency of any other animal or being, in   
her spirit, spectre, or apparition. When the person   
on trial was accused of having tortured or strangled   
or pinched or bruised another, it did not break the   
force of the accusation to bring hundreds of witnesses   
to prove that he was, at the very time, in another   
remote place or country; for it was alleged that he   
was present in the spectral shape in which Satan enabled his spirit to be and to act any and every where at   
once. It was impossible to disprove the charge, and   
the last defence of innocence was swept away.</p>   
<p>If any thing strange or remarkable could be discovered in the persons, histories, or deportment of accused   
persons, the usage of the tribunals, and the books of   
authority on the subject, allowed it to be brought in   
<pb n="408" id="vI408"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1453">   
<figDesc>Page 408.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
evidence against them. If any thing they had forewarned, or even conjectured, happened to come to   
pass, any careless speech had been verified by events,   
any extraordinary knowledge had been manifested, or   
any marvellous feats of strength or agility been displayed, they were brought up with decisive and fatal   
effect.</p>   
<p>A witch was believed to have the power of operating   
upon her victims, at any distance, by the instrumentality of puppets. She would procure or make an   
object like a doll, or a figure of some animal, &mdash; any   
little bunch of cloth or bundle of rags would answer   
the purpose. She would will the puppet to represent   
the person whom she proposed to torment or afflict;   
and then whatever she did to the puppet would be   
suffered by the party it represented at any distance,   
however remote. A pin stuck into the puppet would   
pierce the flesh of the person whom she wished to   
afflict, and produce the appropriate sensations of pain.   
So would a pinch, or a blow, or any kind of violence.   
When any one was arrested on the charge of witchcraft, a search was immediately made for puppets   
from garret to cellar; and if any thing could be found   
that might possibly be imagined to possess that character, &mdash; any remnant of flannel or linen wrapped up,   
the foot of an old stocking, or a cushion of any kind,   
particularly if there were any pins in it, &mdash; it was considered as weighty and quite decisive evidence against   
the accused party.</p>   
<p>A writer, in a recent number of the &ldquo;North   
<pb n="409" id="vI409"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1454">   
<figDesc>Page 409.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
Review,&rdquo; on the superstitions of the American   
Indians, makes the following statement: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The sorcerer, by charms, magic songs, magic feats,   
and the beating of his drum, had power over the spirits, and   
those occult influences inherent in animals and inanimate   
things. He could call to him the souls of his enemies.   
They appeared before him in the form of stones. He   
chopped and bruised them with his hatchet; blood and flesh   
issued forth; and the intended victim, however distant, languished and died. Like the sorcerer of the middle ages, he   
made images of those he wished to destroy, and, muttering   
incantations, punctured them with an awl; whereupon the   
persons represented sickened and pined away.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>It was a received opinion, accredited and acted upon   
in courts, that a person in confederacy with the Evil   
One could not weep. Those accused of this crime,   
both in Europe and America, were, in many instances,   
of an age and condition which rendered it impossible   
for them, however innocent, to escape the effect of this   
test. A decrepit, emaciated person, shrivelled and   
desiccated by age, was placed at the bar: and if she   
could not weep on the spot; if, in consequence of her   
withered frame, her amazement and indignation at the   
false and malignant charges by which she was circumvented, her exhausted sensibility, her sullen despair,   
the hopeless horror of her situation, or, from what   
often was found to be the effect of the treatment such   
persons received, a high-toned consciousness of innocence, and a brave defiance and stern condemnation   
of her maligners and persecutors; if, from any cause,   
<pb n="410" id="vI410"/>

<figDesc>Page 410.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the fountain of tears was closed or dried up, &mdash; their   
failure to come forth at the bidding of her defamers   
was regarded as a sure and irrefragable proof of her   
guilt.</p>   
<p>King James explains the circumstance, that witches   
could not weep, in rather a curious manner: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;For as, in a secret murther, if the dead carkasse bee at   
any time thereafter handled by the murtherer it will gush   
out of bloud, as if the bloud were crying to the heaven for   
revenge of the murtherer, God having appointed that secret   
supernaturall signe for triall of that secret unnaturall crime;   
so it appeares that God hath appointed (for a supernaturall   
signe of the monstrous impietie of witches), that the water   
shall refuse to receive them in her bosome that have shaken   
off them the sacred water of baptisme, and wilfully refused   
the benefite thereof: no, not so much as their eyes are able   
to shed teares (threaten and torture them as ye please),   
while first they repent (God not permitting them to dissemble their obstinacie in so horrible a crime), albeit the   
woman kind especially be able otherwise to shed teares at   
every light occasion when they will, &mdash; yea, although it were   
dissemblingly like the crocodiles.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Reginald Scott, in introducing a Romish form of   
adjuration, makes the following excellent remarks on   
the trial by tears: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;But alas that teares should be thought sufficient to   
excuse or condemn in so great a cause, and so weightie a   
triall! I am sure that the worst sort of the children of   
Israel wept bitterlie; yea, if there were any witches at all   
in Israel, they wept. For it is written, that all the children   
<pb n="411" id="vI411"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1456">   
<figDesc>Page 411.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of Israel wept. Finallie, if there be any witches in hell, I   
am sure they weepe; for there is weeping and wailing and   
gnashing of teeth. But God knoweth many an honest   
matron cannot sometimes in the heaviness of her heart shed   
teares; the which oftentimes are more readie and common   
with crafty queans and strumpets than with sober women.   
For we read of two kinds of teares in a woman's eie; the   
one of true greefe, and the other of deceipt. And it is written, that `Dediscere flere f&oelig;minam est mendacium;' which   
argueth that they lie, which saie that wicked women cannot   
weepe. But let these tormentors take heed, that the teares   
in this case which runne down the widowe's cheeks, with   
their crie, spoken of by Jesus Sirach, be not heard above.   
But, lo, what learned, godlie and lawful meanes these   
Popish Inquisitors have invented for the triall of true or   
false teares: &mdash;</p>   
<p>`I conjure thee, by the amorous tears which Jesus Christ,   
our Saviour, shed upon the crosse for the salvation of the   
world; and by the most earnest and burning teares of his   
mother, the most glorious Virgine Marie, sprinkled upon   
his wounds late in the evening; and by all the teares which   
everie saint and elect vessell of God hath poured out heere   
in the world, and from whose eies he hath wiped awaie all   
teares, &mdash; that, if thou be without fault, thou maist poure   
downe teares aboundantlie; and, if thou be guiltie, that thou   
weep in no wise. In the name of the Father, of the Sonne,   
and of the Holie Ghost. Amen.'</p>   
<p>&ldquo;The more you conjure, the lesse she weepeth.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>A distinction was made between black and white   
witches. The former were those who had leagued   
with Satan for the purpose of doing injury to others,   
<pb n="412" id="vI412"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1457">   
<figDesc>Page 412.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
while the latter class was composed of such persons as   
had resorted to the arts and charms of divination and   
sorcery in order to protect themselves and others from   
diabolical influence. They were both considered as   
highly, if not equally, criminal. Fuller, in his &ldquo;Profane State,&rdquo; thus speaks of them: &ldquo;Better is it to lap   
one's pottage like a dog, than to eat it mannerly, with   
a spoon of the Devil's giving. Black witches hurt and   
do mischief; but, in deeds of darkness, there is no   
difference of colors. The white and the black are   
both guilty alike in compounding with the Devil.&rdquo;   
White witches pretended to extract their power from the   
mysterious virtues of certain plants. The following   
form of charmed words was used in plucking them: &mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l>&ldquo;Hail to thee, holy herb,</l>   
<l rend="indent">Growing in the ground;</l>   
<l>On the Mount of Calvarie,</l>   
<l rend="indent">First wert thou found;</l>   
<l>Thou art good for many a grief,</l>   
<l rend="indent">And healest many a wound:</l>   
<l>In the name of sweet Jesu,</l>   
<l rend="indent">I lift thee from the ground.&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>Then there was the evidence of ocular fascination.   
The accused and the accusers were brought into the   
presence of the examining magistrate, and the supposed witch was ordered to look upon the afflicted   
persons; instantly upon coming within the glance of   
her eye, they would scream out, and fall down as in a   
fit. It was thought that an invisible and impalpable   
fluid darted from the eye of the witch, and penetrated   
the brain of the bewitched. By bringing the witch so   
<pb n="413" id="vI413"/>

<figDesc>Page 413.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
near that she could touch the afflicted persons with her   
hand, the malignant fluid was attracted back into   
her hand, and the sufferers recovered their senses. It   
is singular to notice the curious resemblance between   
this opinion &mdash; the joint product of superstition and   
imposture &mdash; and the results to which modern science   
has led us in the discoveries of galvanism and animal   
electricity. The doctrine of fascination maintained its   
hold upon the public credulity for a long time, and gave   
occasion to the phrase, still in familiar use among us,   
of &ldquo;looking upon a person with an evil eye.&rdquo; Its   
advocates claimed, in its defence, the authority of the   
Cartesian philosophy; but it cannot be considered, in   
an age of science and reason, as having any better   
support than the rural superstition of Virgil's simple   
shepherd, who thus complains of the condition of his   
emaciated flock:&mdash;</p>   
<q><lg type="verse">   
<l rend="indent">&ldquo;They look so thin,</l>   
<l>Their bones are barely covered with their skin.</l>   
<l>What magic has bewitched the woolly dams?</l>   
<l>And what ill eyes beheld the tender lambs?&rdquo;</l>   
</lg></q>   
<p>Witchcraft, in all ages and countries, was recognized   
as a reality, just as much as any of the facts of nature,   
or incidents to which mankind is liable. By the laws   
of all nations, Catholic and Protestant alike, in the old   
country and in the new, it was treated as a capital   
offence, and classed with murder and other highest   
crimes, although regarded as of a deeper dye and   
blacker character than them all. Indictments and   
trials of persons accused of it were not, therefore,

considered as of any special interest, or as differing in   
any essential particulars from proceedings against any   
other description of offenders. There had been many   
such proceedings in the American colonies, &mdash; more,   
perhaps, than have come to our knowledge, &mdash; previous   
to 1692. They were not looked upon as sufficiently   
extraordinary to be transferred, from the oblivion   
sweeping like a perpetual deluge over the vast multitude of human experiences, to the ark of history,   
which rescues only a select few. The following are   
the principal facts of this class of which we have information:&mdash;</p>   
<p>William Penn presided, in his judicial character, at   
the trial of two Swedish women for witchcraft; the   
grand jury, acting under instructions from him, having   
found bills against them. They were saved, not in consequence of any peculiar reluctance to proceed against   
them arising out of the nature of the alleged crime,   
but only from some technical defect in the indictment.   
If it had not been for this accidental circumstance, as   
the annalist of Philadelphia suggests, scenes similar   
to those subsequently occurring in Salem Village   
might have darkened the history of the Quakers,   
Swedes, Germans, and Dutch, who dwelt in the City of   
Brotherly Love and the adjacent colonies. There had   
been trials and executions for witchcraft in other parts   
of New England, and excitements had obtained more   
or less currency in reference to the assaults of the   
powers of darkness upon human affairs. These incidents prepared the way for the delusion in Salem, and

<figDesc>Page 415.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
provided elements to form its character. They must   
not, therefore, be wholly overlooked. But the memorials for their elucidation are very defective. Hutchinson &ldquo;History of Massachusetts&rdquo; is, perhaps, the most   
valuable authority on the subject. He enjoyed an   
advantage over any other writer, before, since, or hereafter, so far as relates to the witchcraft proceedings   
in 1692; for he had access to all the records and documents connected with it, a great part of which have subsequently been lost or destroyed. His treatment of that   
particular topic is more satisfactory than can elsewhere   
be found. But of incidents of the sort that preceded   
it, his information appears to have been very slight and   
unreliable. It is a singular fact, that we know more of   
the history of the first century of New England than   
was known by the most enlightened persons of the intermediate century. There was no regular organized   
newspaper press, the commemorative age had not begun, and none seem to have been fully aware of the   
importance of putting events on record. The publication, but a few years since, of the colonial journals of   
the first half-century of Massachusetts; researches by   
innumerable hands among papers on file in public   
offices; the printing of town-histories, and the collections made by historical and genealogical societies, &mdash;   
have rescued from oblivion, and redeemed from error,   
many points of the greatest interest and importance.</p>   
<p>Winthrop, in his &ldquo;Journal,&rdquo; gives an account of the   
execution of Margaret Jones, of Charlestown, who had   
been tried and condemned by the Court of Assistants.   
<pb n="416" id="vI416"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1461">   
<figDesc>Page 416.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
The charges against her were, that she had a malignant   
touch, so that many persons, &mdash; &ldquo;men, women, and children,&rdquo; &mdash; on coming in contact with her, were &ldquo;taken   
with deafness, vomiting, or other violent pains or sickness;&rdquo; that she practised physic, and her medicines,   
&ldquo;being such things as (by her own confession) were   
harmless, as aniseed, liquors, &amp;c., yet had extraordinary violent effects;&rdquo; and that they found on her body,   
&ldquo;upon a forced search,&rdquo; the witchmarks, particularly   
&ldquo;a teat, as fresh if it had been newly sucked.&rdquo; Other   
ridiculous allegations were made against her. As for   
the effects of the touch, it is obvious that they could be   
easily simulated by evil-disposed persons. The whole   
substance of her offence seems to have been, that she   
was very successful in the use of simple prescriptions   
for the cure of diseases. Her practice was charged as   
&ldquo;against the ordinary course, and beyond the apprehension of all physicians and surgeons.&rdquo; A bitter   
animosity was, accordingly, raised against her. She   
treated her accusers and defamers with indignant resentment. &ldquo;Her behavior at her trial,&rdquo; says Winthrop,   
&ldquo;was very intemperate, lying notoriously, and railing   
upon the jury and witnesses, &amp;c.; and, in the like distemper, she died.&rdquo; We shall find that the bold assertion   
of innocence, and indignant denunciations of the persecutors and defamers who had destroyed their reputations and pursued them to the death, by persons tried   
and executed for witchcraft, in 1692, were regarded by   
some, as they were by Winthrop, as proofs of ill-temper   
and falsehood. The Governor closes his statement   
<pb n="417" id="vI417"/>

about Margaret Jones, by relating what he regarded as   
a demonstration of her guilt: &ldquo;The same day and   
hour she was executed, there was a very great tempest   
at Connecticut, which blew down many trees, &amp;c.&rdquo;   
The records of the General Court contain no express   
notice of this case. Perhaps it is referred to in   
the following paragraph, under date of May 13,   
1648: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;This Court, being desirous that the same course which   
hath been taken in England for the discovery of witches, by   
watching, may also be taken here, with the witch now in   
question, and therefore do order that a strict watch be set   
about her every night, and that her husband be confined to a   
private room, and watched also.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Margaret Jones was executed in Boston on the 15th   
of June. Hutchinson refers to the statement made by   
Johnson, in the &ldquo;Wonder-working Providence,&rdquo; that   
&ldquo;more than one or two in Springfield, in 1645, were   
suspected of witchcraft; that much diligence was   
used, both for the finding them and for the Lord's   
assisting them against their witchery; yet have they,   
as is supposed, bewitched not a few persons, among   
whom two of the reverend elder's children.&rdquo; Johnson loose and immethodical narrative covers the   
period from 1645 till toward the end of 1651; and   
Hutchinson was probably misled in supposing that the   
Springfield cases occurred as early as 1645. The Massachusetts colonial records, under the date of May 8,   
1651, have this entry: &mdash;</p>   
<pb n="418" id="vI418"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1463">   
<figDesc>Page 418.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The Court, understanding that Mary Parsons, now in   
prison, accused for a witch, is likely, through weakness, to   
die before trial, if it be deferred, do order, that, on the   
morrow, by eight o'clock in the morning, she be brought   
before and tried by the General Court, the rather that   
Mr. Pinchon may be present to give his testimony in the   
case.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Mr. Pinchon was probably able to stay a few days   
longer. She was not brought to trial before the Court   
until the 13th, under which date is the following: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Mary Parsons, wife of Hugh Parsons, of Springfield,   
being committed to prison for suspicion of witchcraft, as also   
for murdering her own child, was this day called forth, and   
indicted for witchcraft. `By the name of Mary Parsons, you   
are here, before the General Court, charged, in the name of   
this Commonwealth, that, not having the fear of God before   
your eyes nor in your heart, being seduced by the Devil,   
and yielding to his malicious motion, about the end of   
February last, at Springfield, to have familiarity, or consulted   
with, a familiar spirit, making a covenant with him; and   
have used divers devilish practices by witchcraft, to the   
hurt of the persons of Martha and Rebecca Moxon, against   
the word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction, long   
since made and published.' To which indictment she pleaded   
`Not guilty.' All evidences brought in against her being   
heard and examined, the Court found the evidences were not   
sufficient to prove her a witch, and therefore she was cleared   
in that respect.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;At the same time, she was indicted for murdering her   
child. `By the name of Mary Parsons, you are here, before   
the General Court, charged, in the name of this Commonwealth,   
<pb n="419" id="vI419"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1464">   
<figDesc>Page 419.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that, not having the fear of God before your eyes   
nor in your heart, being seduced by the Devil, and yielding   
to his instigations and the wickedness of your own heart,   
about the beginning of March last, in Springfield, in or near   
your own house, did wilfully and most wickedly murder   
your own child, against the word of God and the laws of   
this jurisdiction, long since made and published.' To which   
she acknowledged herself guilty.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;The Court, finding her guilty of murder by her own confession, &amp;c., proceeded to judgment: `You shall be carried   
from this place to the place from whence you came, and   
from thence to the place of execution, and there hang till   
you be dead.&rdquo;'</p></q>   
<p>Under the same date &mdash; May 13 &mdash; is an order of   
the Court appointing a day of humiliation &ldquo;throughout our jurisdiction in all the churches,&rdquo; in consideration, among other things, of the extent to which   
&ldquo;Satan prevails amongst us in respect of witchcrafts.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The colonial records, under date of May 31, 1652,   
recite the facts, that Hugh Parsons, of Springfield, had   
been tried before the Court of Assistants &mdash; held at   
Boston, May 12, 1652 &mdash; for witchcraft; that the case   
was transferred to a &ldquo;jury of trials,&rdquo; which found him   
guilty. The magistrates not consenting to the verdict   
of the jury, the case came legally to the General   
Court, which body decided that &ldquo;he was not legally   
guilty of witchcraft, and so not to die by law.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>When these citations are collated and examined, and   
it is remembered that Mr. Moxon was the &ldquo;reverend   
elder&rdquo; of the church at Springfield, it cannot be doubted   
<pb n="420" id="vI420"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1465">   
<figDesc>Page 420.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
that the case of the Parsonses is that referred to by   
Johnson in the &ldquo;Wonder-working Providence,&rdquo; and   
that Hutchinson was in error as to the date. We are   
left in doubt as to the fate of Mary Parsons. There is   
a marginal entry on the records, to the effect that she   
was reprieved to the 29th of May. Neither Johnson   
nor Hutchinson seem to have thought that the sentence   
was ever carried into effect. It clearly never ought to   
have been. The woman was in a weak and dying condition, her mind was probably broken down, &mdash; the   
victim of that peculiar kind of mania &mdash; partaking of   
the character of a religious fanaticism and perversion   
of ideas &mdash; that has often led to child-murder.</p>   
<p>These instances show, that, at that time, the General Court exercised consideration and discrimination   
in the treatment of questions of this kind brought before it.</p>   
<p>Hutchinson, on the authority of Hale, says that   
a woman at Dorchester, and another at Cambridge,   
were executed, not far from this time, for witchcraft;   
and that they asserted their innocence with their dying   
breath. He also says, that, in 1650, &ldquo;a poor wretch,   
&mdash; Mary Oliver, &mdash; probably weary of her life from the   
general reputation of being a witch, after long examination, was brought to a confession of her guilt; but I do   
not find that she was executed.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>In 1656, a very remarkable case occurred. William   
Hibbins was a merchant in Boston, and one of the most   
prominent and honored citizens of Massachusetts. He   
was admitted a freeman in 1640; was deputy in the   
<pb n="421" id="vI421"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1466">   
<figDesc>Page 421.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
General Court in that and the following year; was   
elected an assistant for twelve successive years, &mdash; from   
1643 to 1654; represented the Colony, for a time, as   
its agent in England, and received the thanks of the   
General Court for his valuable service there. No one   
appears to have had more influence, or to have enjoyed   
more honorable distinction, during his long legislative   
career. He died in 1654. Hutchinson says, in the   
text of his first and second volumes, that his widow   
was tried, condemned, and hanged as a witch in 1655,   
although he corrects the error in a note to the passage   
in the first volume. The following is the statement of   
the case in the Massachusetts colonial records, under   
the date of May 14, 1656: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The magistrates not receiving the verdict of the jury   
in Mrs. Hibbins her case, having been on trial for witchcraft,   
it came and fell, of course, to the General Court. Mrs. Ann   
Hibbins was called forth, appeared at the bar, the indictment   
against her was read; to which she answered, `Not guilty,'   
and was willing to be tried by God and this Court. The   
evidence against her was read, the parties witnessing being   
present, her answers considered on; and the whole Court,   
being met together, by their vote, determined that Mrs. Ann   
Hibbins is guilty of witchcraft, according to the bill of indictment found against her by the jury of life and death.   
The Governor, in open Court, pronounced sentence accordingly; declaring she was to go from the bar to the place from   
whence she came, and from thence to the place of execution,   
and there to hang till she was dead.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;It is ordered, that warrant shall issue out from the secretary to the marshal general, for the execution of Mrs. Hibbins,   
<pb n="422" id="vI422"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1467">   
<figDesc>Page 422.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
on the fifth day next come fortnight, presently after the   
lecture at Boston, being the 19th of June next; the marshal   
general taking with him a sufficient guard.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Mrs. Hibbins is stated to have been a sister of Richard Bellingham, at that very time deputy-governor,   
and always regarded as one of the chief men in the   
country. Strange to say, very little notice appears to   
have been taken of this event, beyond the immediate   
locality; but what little has come down to us indicates that it was a case of outrageous folly and barbarity, justly reflecting infamy upon the community at   
the time. Hutchinson, who wrote a hundred years   
after the event, and evidently had no other foundation   
for his opinion than vague conjectural tradition, gives   
the following explanation of the proceedings against   
her: &ldquo;Losses, in the latter part of her husband's life,   
had reduced his estate, and increased the natural crabbedness of his wife's temper, which made her turbulent   
and quarrelsome, and brought her under church censures, and at length rendered her so odious to her   
neighbors as to cause some of them to accuse her of   
witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>While this is hardly worthy of being considered a   
sufficient explanation of the matter, &mdash; it being beyond   
belief, that, even at that time, a person could be condemned and executed merely on account of a &ldquo;crabbed   
temper,&rdquo; &mdash; it is not consistent with the facts, as made   
known to us from the record-offices. She could not   
have been so reduced in circumstances as to produce   
such extraordinary effects upon her character, for she   
<pb n="423" id="vI423"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1468">   
<figDesc>Page 423.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
left a good estate. The truth is, that the tongue of   
slander was let loose upon her, and the calumnies circulated by reckless gossip became so magnified and   
exaggerated, and assumed such proportions, as enabled   
her vilifiers to bring her under the censure of the   
church, and that emboldened them to cry out against   
her as a witch. Hutchinson expresses the opinion that   
she was the victim of popular clamor. But that alone,   
without some pretence or show of evidence, could not   
have brought the General Court, in reversal of the   
judgment of the magistrates, to condemn to death a   
person of such a high social position.</p>   
<p>The only clue we have to the kind of evidence bearing upon the charge of witchcraft that brought this   
recently bereaved widow to so cruel and shameful   
a death, is in a letter, written by a clergyman in   
Jamaica to Increase Mather in 1684, in which he says,   
&ldquo;You may remember what I have sometimes told you   
your famous Mr. Norton once said at his own table,   
&mdash; before Mr. Wilson, the pastor, elder Penn, and myself and wife, &amp;c., who had the honor to be his guests,   
&mdash; that one of your magistrate's wives, as I remember,   
was hanged for a witch only for having more wit than   
her neighbors. It was his very expression; she having, as he explained it, unhappily guessed that two of   
her persecutors, whom she saw talking in the street,   
were talking of her, which, proving true, cost her her   
life, notwithstanding all he could do to the contrary, as   
he himself told us.&rdquo; Nothing was more natural than   
for her to suppose, knowing the parties, witnessing their   
<pb n="424" id="vI424"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1469">   
<figDesc>Page 424.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
manner, considering their active co-operation in getting up the excitement against her, which was then the   
all-engrossing topic, that they were talking about her.   
But, in the blind infatuation of the time, it was considered proof positive of her being possessed, by the aid   
of the Devil, of supernatural insight, &mdash; precisely as,   
forty years afterwards, such evidence was brought to   
bear, with telling effect, against George Burroughs. &mdash;   
The body of this unfortunate lady was searched for   
witchmarks, and her trunks and premises rummaged   
for puppets.</p>   
<p>It is quite evident that means were used to get up a   
violent popular excitement against her, which became   
so formidable as to silence every voice that dared to   
speak in her favor. Joshua Scottow, a citizen of great   
respectability and a selectman, ventured to give evidence in her favor, counter, in its bearings, to some   
testimony against her; and he was dealt with very   
severely, and compelled to write an humble apology to   
the Court, to disavow all friendly interest in Mrs. Hibbins, and to pray &ldquo;that the sword of justice may be   
drawn forth against all wickedness.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I am   
cordially sorry that any thing from me, either by word   
or writing, should give offence to the honored Court,   
my dear brethren in the church, or any others.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Hutchinson states that there were, however, some   
persons then in Boston, who denounced the proceedings against Mrs. Hibbins, and regarded her, not merely   
as a persecuted woman, but as &ldquo;a saint;&rdquo; that a deep   
feeling of resentment against her persecutors long   
<pb n="425" id="vI425"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1470">   
<figDesc>Page 425.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
remained in their minds; and that they afterwards   
&ldquo;observed solemn marks of Providence set upon those   
who were very forward to condemn her.&rdquo; It is evident that the Court of Magistrates were opposed to   
her conviction, and that Mr. Norton did what he could   
to save her. He was one of the four &ldquo;great Johns,&rdquo;   
who were the first ministers of the church in Boston;   
and it is remarkable, as showing the violence of the   
people against her, that even his influence was of no   
avail in her favor. But she had other friends, as   
appears from her will, which, after all, is the only   
source of reliable information we have respecting her   
character. It is dated May 27, 1656, a few days after   
she received the sentence of death. In it she names,   
as overseers and administrators of her estate, &ldquo;Captain Thomas Clarke, Lieutenant Edward Hutchinson,   
Lieutenant William Hudson, Ensign Joshua Scottow,   
and Cornet Peter Oliver.&rdquo; In a codicil, she says, &ldquo;I   
do earnestly desire my loving friends, Captain Johnson   
and Mr. Edward Rawson, to be added to the rest of the   
gentlemen mentioned as overseers of my will.&rdquo; It can   
hardly be doubted, that these persons &mdash; and they were   
all leading citizens &mdash; were known by her to be among   
her friends.</p>   
<p>The whole tone and manner of these instruments   
give evidence, that she had a mind capable of rising   
above the power of wrong, suffering, and death itself.   
They show a spirit calm and serene. The disposition   
of her property indicates good sense, good feeling, and   
business faculties suitable to the occasion. In the   
<pb n="426" id="vI426"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1471">   
<figDesc>Page 426.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
body of the will, there is not a word, a syllable, or a   
turn of expression, that refers to, or is in the slightest   
degree colored by, her peculiar situation. In the   
codicil, dated June 16, there is this sentence: &ldquo;My   
desire is, that all my overseers would be pleased to   
show so much respect unto my dead corpse as to cause   
it to be decently interred, and, if it may be, near my   
late husband.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>When married to Mr. Hibbins, she was a widow,   
named Moore. There were no children by her last   
marriage, &mdash; certainly none living at the time of her   
death. There were three sons by her former marriage, &mdash; John, Joseph, and Jonathan. These were all   
in England; but the youngest, hearing of her situation,   
embarked for America. When she wrote the codicil,   
&mdash; three days before her execution, &mdash; she added, at the   
end, having apparently just heard of his coming, &ldquo;I   
give my son Jonathan twenty pounds, over and above   
what I have already given him, towards his pains and   
charge in coming to see me, which shall be first paid   
out of my estate.&rdquo; There is reason to cherish the   
belief that he reached her in the short interval between   
the date of the codicil and her death, from the tenor   
of the following postscript, written and signed on the   
morning of her execution: &ldquo;My further mind and will   
is, out of my sense of the more than ordinary affection   
and pains of my son Jonathan in the times of my distress, I give him, as a further legacy, ten pounds.&rdquo;   
The will was proved in Court, July 2, 1656. The will   
and codicil speak of her &ldquo;farms at Muddy River;&rdquo; and   
<pb n="427" id="vI427"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1472">   
<figDesc>Page 427.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of chests and a desk, in which were valuables of such   
importance that she took especial pains to intrust the   
keys of them to Edward Rawson, in a provision of   
the codicil. The estate was inventoried at &pound;344. 14s.,   
which was a considerable property in those days, as   
money was then valued.</p>   
<p>Hutchinson mentions a case of witchcraft in Hartford, in 1662, where some women were accused, and,   
after being proceeded against until they were confounded and bewildered, one of them made the most   
preposterous confessions, which ought to have satisfied   
every one that her reason was overthrown; three of   
them were condemned, and one, certainly, &mdash; probably   
all, &mdash; executed. In 1669, he says that Susanna Martin, of Salisbury, &mdash; whom we shall meet again, &mdash; was   
bound over to the Court on the same charge, &ldquo;but   
escaped at that time.&rdquo; Another case is mentioned by   
him as having occurred, in 1671, at Groton, in which   
the party confessed, and thereby avoided condemnation. In 1673, a case occurred at Hampton; but the   
jury, although, as they said, there was strong ground of   
suspicion, returned a verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty;&rdquo; the evidence not being deemed quite sufficient. There were   
several other cases, about this time, in which some   
persons were severely handled in consequence of being reputed witches; and others suffered, as they imagined, &ldquo;under an evil hand.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>In this immediate neighborhood, there had been   
several attempts, previous to the delusion at Salem   
Village in 1692, to get up witchcraft prosecutions,   
<pb n="428" id="vI428"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1473">   
<figDesc>Page 428.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
but without much success. The people of this county   
had not become sufficiently infected with the fanaticism of the times to proceed to extremities.</p>   
<p>In September, 1652, the following presentment was   
made by the grand jury: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;We present John Bradstreet, of Rowley, for suspicion   
of having familiarity with the Devil. He said he read in a   
book of magic, and that he heard a voice asking him what   
work he had for him. He answered, `Go make a bridge of   
sand over the sea; go make a ladder of sand up to heaven,   
and go to God, and come down no more.'</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Witness hereof, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis Parat</hi> and his wife, of Rowley.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Witness, <hi rend="smallcaps">William Bartholomew,</hi> of Ipswich.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>On the 28th of that month, the jury at Ipswich,   
&ldquo;upon examination of the case, found he had told a   
lie, which was a second, being convicted once before.   
The Court sets a fine of twenty shillings, or else to be   
whipped.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>Bradstreet was probably in the habit of romancing,   
and it was wisely oncluded not to take a more serious   
view of his offences.</p>   
<p>In 1658, a singular case of this kind occurred in   
Essex County. The following papers relating to it   
illustrate the sentiments and forms of thought prevalent at that time, and give an insight of the state of   
society in some particulars: &mdash;</p>

some time suffered losses in their estates, and some affliction in their bodies also, &mdash; which, as they suppose, doth not   
arise from any natural cause, or any neglect in themselves,   
but rather from some ill-disposed person, &mdash; that, upon differences had betwixt themselves and one John Godfrey,   
resident at Andover or elsewhere at his pleasure, we whose

<p>The petitioners mention in brief some instances   
in confirmation of their complaint. There are several depositions. That of Charles Browne and wife   
says: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;About six or seven years since, in the meeting-house of   
Rowley, being in the gallery in the first seat, there was one   
in the second seat which he doth, to his best remembrance,   
think and believe it was John Godfrey. This deponent did   
see him, yawning, open his mouth; and, while he so yawned,   
this deponent did see a small teat under his tongue. And,   
further, this deponent saith that John Godfrey was in this   
deponent's house about three years since. Speaking about   
the power of witches, he the said Godfrey spoke, that, if   
witches were not kindly entertained, the Devil will appear   
unto them, and ask them if they were grieved or vexed with   
anybody, and ask them what he should do for them; and, if   
<pb n="430" id="vI430"/>

they would not give them beer or victuals, they might let all   
the beer run out of the cellar; and, if they looked steadfastly upon any creature, it would die; and, if it were hard   
to some witches to take away life, either of man or beast,   
yet, when they once begin it, then it is easy to them.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The depositions in this case are presented as they   
are in the originals on file, leaving in blank such   
words or parts of words as have been worn off. They   
are given in full.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Isabel Holdred,</hi> who testifieth   
that John Godfree came to the house of Henry Blazdall,   
where her husband and herself were, and demanded a debt   
of her husband, and said a warrant was out, and Goodman   
Lord was suddenly to come. John Godfree asked if we would   
not pay him. The deponent answered, `Yes, to-night or to, if we had it; for I believe we shall not.... we   
are in thy debt.' John Godfree answered, `That is a bitter   
word;'.... said, `I must begin, and must send Goodman   
Lord.' The deponent answered, `.... when thou wilt. I   
fear thee not, nor all the devils in hell!' And, further, this   
deponent testifieth, that, two days after this, she was taken   
with those strange fits, with which she was tormented a   
fortnight together, night and day. And several apparitions   
appeared to the deponent in the night. The first night, a   
humble-bee, the next night a bear, appeared, which grinned   
the teeth and shook the claw: `Thou sayest thou art not   
afraid. Thou thinkest Harry Blazdall's house will save   
thee.' The deponent answered, `I hope the Lord Jesus   
Christ will save me.' The apparition then spake: `Thou   
sayst thou art not afraid of all the devils in hell; but I will

have thy heart's blood within a few hours!' The next was   
the apparition of a great snake, at which the deponent was   
exceedingly affrighted, and skipt to Nathan Gold, who   
was in the opposite chimney-corner, and caught hold of the   
hair of his head; and her speech was taken away for the space   
of half an hour. The next night appeared a great horse;   
and, Thomas Hayne being there, the deponent told him of   
it, and showed him where. The said Tho. Hayne took a   
stick, and struck at the place where the apparition was; and   
his stroke glanced by the side of it, and it went under the   
table. And he went to strike again; then the apparition   
fled to the.... and made it shake, and went away.   
And, about a week after, the deponent.... son were at   
the door of Nathan Gold, and heard a rushing on the....   
The deponent said to her son, `Yonder is a beast.' He answered, `'Tis one of Goodman Cobbye's black oxen;' and it   
came toward them, and came within.... yards of them.   
The deponent her heart began to ache, for it seemed to   
have great eyes; and spoke to the boy, `Let's go in.' But   
suddenly the ox beat her up against the wall, and struck her   
down; and she was much hurt by it, not being able to rise   
up. But some others carried me into the house, all my face   
being bloody, being much bruised. The boy was much   
affrighted a long time after; and, for the space of two   
hours, he was in a sweat that one might have washed hands   
on his hair. Further this deponent affirmeth, that she hath   
been often troubled with.... black cat sometimes appearing in the house, and sometimes in the night....   
bed, and lay on her, and sometimes stroking her face. The   
cat seemed.... thrice as big as an ordinary cat.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Hayne</hi> testifieth, that, being with Goodwife   
Holdridge, she told me that she saw a great horse, and

showed me where it stood. I then took a stick, and struck   
on the place, but felt nothing; and I heard the door shake,   
and Good. H. said it was gone out at the door. Immediately after, she was taken with extremity of fear and pain,   
so that she presently fell into a sweat, and I thought she   
would swoon. She trembled and shook like a leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Nathan Gould</hi> being with Goodwife Holgreg one

and could not speak for the space of half an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">William Osgood</hi> testifieth, that, in the yeare '40, in   
the month of August, &mdash; he being then building a barn for   
Mr. Spencer, &mdash; John Godfree being then Mr. Spencer's   
herdsman, he on an evening came to the frame, where divers   
men were at work, and said that he had gotten a new master against the time he had done keeping cows. The said   
William Osgood asked him who it was. He answered, he   
knew not. He again asked him where he dwelt. He answered, he knew not. He asked him what his name was.   
He answered, he knew not. He then said to him, `How,   
then, wilt thou go to him when thy time is out?' He said,   
`The man will come and fetch me then.' I asked him,   
`Hast thou made an absolute bargain?' He answered that   
a covenant was made, and he had set his hand to it. He   
then asked of him whether he had not a counter covenant.   
Godfree answered, `No.' W. O. said, `What a mad fellow   
art thou to make a covenant in this manner!' He said,   
`He's an honest man.' &mdash; `How knowest thou?' said W. O.   
J. Godfree answered. `He looks like one.' W. O. then

the Devil.' He then skipped about, and said, `I profess, I   
profess!'</p>   
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">William Osgood.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The proceedings against Godfrey were carried up to   
other tribunals, as appears by a record of the County   
Court at Salem, 28th of June, 1659: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;John Godfrey stands bound in one hundred pound bond   
to the treasurer of this county for his appearance at a General Court, or Court of Assistants, when he shall be legally   
summonsed thereunto.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>What action, if any, was had by either of these   
high courts, I have found no information. But he   
must have come off unscathed; for, soon after, he commenced actions in the County Court for defamation   
against his accusers, with the following results: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;John Godfery plt. agst. Will. Simonds &amp; <unclear></unclear> his

</figure>   
</p>   
<p>In the trial of the case between Godfrey and Singletary, the latter attempted to prove the truth of his   
allegations against the former, by giving the following   
piece of testimony, which, while it failed to convince   
the jury, is worth preserving, from the inherent interest of some of its details: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Date the fourteenth the twelfth month, '62. &mdash; <hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Jonathan Singletary,</hi> aged about 23, who   
testifieth that I, being in the prison at Ipswich this night last   
past between nine and ten of the clock at night, after the   
bell had rung, I being set in a corner of the prison, upon   
a sudden I heard a great noise as if many cats had been   
climbing up the prison walls, and skipping into the house   
at the windows, and jumping about the chamber; and a   
noise as if boards' ends or stools had been thrown about,   
and men walking in the chambers, and a crackling and   
shaking as if the house would have fallen upon me. I seeing this, and considering what I knew by a young man that   
kept at my house last Indian Harvest, and, upon some   
difference with John Godfre, he was presently several nights   
in a strange manner troubled, and complaining as he did, and   
upon consideration of this and other things that I knew by   
him, I was at present something affrighted; yet considering   
what I had lately heard made out by Mr. Mitchel at   
Cambridge, that there is more good in God than there is   
evil in sin, and that although God is the greatest good, and   
sin the greatest evil, yet the first Being of evil cannot weane   
the scales or overpower the first Being of good: so considering that the author of good was of greater power than the   
author of evil, God was pleased of his goodness to keep me   
from being out of measure frighted. So this noise abovesaid   
<pb n="435" id="vI435"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1480">   
<figDesc>Page 435.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
held as I suppose about a quarter of an hour, and then   
ceased: and presently I heard the bolt of the door shoot or   
go back as perfectly, to my thinking, as I did the next morning when the keeper came to unlock it; and I could not see   
the door open, but I saw John Godfre stand within the door   
and said, `Jonathan, Jonathan.' So I, looking on him, said,   
`What have you to do with me?' He said, `I come to see   
you: are you weary of your place yet?' I answered, `I take   
no delight in being here, but I will be out as soon as I can.'   
He said, `If you will pay me in corn, you shall come out.'   
I answered, `No: if that had been my intent, I would have   
paid the marshal, and never have come hither.' He, knocking of his fist at me in a kind of a threatening way, said he   
would make me weary of my part, and so went away, I   
knew not how nor which way; and, as I was walking about   
in the prison, I tripped upon a stone with my heel, and took   
it up in my hand, thinking that if he came again I would   
strike at him. So, as I was walking about, he called at the   
window, `Jonathan,' said he, `if you will pay me corn, I will   
give you two years day, and we will come to an agreement;'   
I answered him saying, `Why do you come dissembling and   
playing the Devil's part here? Your nature is nothing but   
envy and malice, which you will vent, though to your own   
loss; and you seek peace with no man.' &mdash; `I do not dissemble,' said he: `I will give you my hand upon it, I am in   
earnest.' So he put his hand in at the window, and I took   
hold of it with my left hand, and pulled him to me; and   
with the stone in my right hand I thought I struck him,   
and went to recover my hand to strike again, and his hand   
was gone, and I would have struck, but there was nothing   
to strike: and how he went away I know not; for I could   
<pb n="436" id="vI436"/>

<figDesc>Page 436.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
neither feel when his hand went out of mine, nor see which   
way he went.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>It can hardly be doubted, that Singletary's story   
was the result of the workings of an excited imagination, in wild and frightful dreams under the spasms   
of nightmare. We shall meet similar phenomena,   
when we come to the testimony in the trials of 1692.</p>   
<p>Godfrey was a most eccentric character. He courted   
and challenged the imputation of witchcraft, and took   
delight in playing upon the credulity of his neighbors,   
enjoying the exhibition of their amazement, horror, and   
consternation. He was a person of much notoriety,   
had more lawsuits, it is probable, than any other man   
in the colony, and in one instance came under the   
criminal jurisdiction for familiarity with other than   
immaterial spirits; for we find, by the record of Sept.   
25, 1666, that John Godfrey was &ldquo;fined for being   
drunk.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>I have allowed so much space to the foregoing documents, because they show the fancies which, fermenting in the public mind, and inflamed by the prevalent   
literature, theology, and philosophy, came to a head   
thirty years afterwards; and because they prove that   
in 1660 a conviction for witchcraft could not be obtained in this county. The evidence against none of   
the convicts in 1692, throwing out of view the statements and actings of the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; was half   
so strong as that against Godfrey. Short work would   
have been made with him then.</p>   
<p>There is one particularly interesting item in Singletary   
<pb n="437" id="vI437"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1482">   
<figDesc>Page 437.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
deposition. It illustrates the value of good   
preaching. This young man, in his gloomy prison,   
and overwhelmed with the terrors of superstition,   
found consolation, courage, and strength in what he   
remembered of a sermon, to which he had happened   
to listen, from &ldquo;Matchless Mitchel.&rdquo; It was indeed   
good doctrine; and it is to be lamented that it was   
not carried out to its logical conclusions, and constantly enforced by the divines of that and subsequent   
times.</p>   
<p>In November, 1669, there was a prosecution of   
&ldquo;Goody Burt,&rdquo; a widow, concerning whom the most   
marvellous stories were told. The principal witness   
against her was Philip Reed, a physician, who on oath   
declared his belief that &ldquo;no natural cause&rdquo; could   
produce such effects as were wrought by Goody Burt   
upon persons whom she afflicted. Her range of operations seems to have been confined to Marblehead,   
Lynn, Salem, and the vicinity: as nothing more was   
ever heard of the case, another evidence is afforded,   
that an Essex jury, notwithstanding this positive opinion of a doctor, was not ready to convict on the   
charge of witchcraft. This same Philip Reed tried   
very hard to prosecute proceedings, eleven years afterwards, against Margaret Gifford as a witch. But she   
failed to appear, and no effort is recorded as having   
been made to apprehend her.</p>   
<p>In 1673, Eunice Cole, of Hampton, was tried before   
a county court, at Salisbury, on the charge of witchcraft; and she was committed to jail, in Boston, for   
<pb n="438" id="vI438"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1483">   
<figDesc>Page 438.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
further proceedings. She was subsequently indicted   
by the Grand Jury for the Massachusetts jurisdiction   
for &ldquo;familiarity with the Devil.&rdquo; The Court of Assistants found that there was &ldquo;just ground of vehement suspicion of her having had familiarity with the   
Devil,&rdquo; and got rid of the case by ordering her &ldquo;to   
depart from and abide out of this jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>At a County Court, held at Salem, Nov. 24, 1674, a   
case was brought up, of which the following is all we   
know: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Christopher Browne having reported that he had been   
treating or discoursing with one whom he apprehended to   
be the Devil, which came like a gentleman, in order to his   
binding himself to be a servant to him, upon his examination, his discourse seeming inconsistent with truth, &amp;c., the   
Court, giving him good counsel and caution, for the present   
dismiss him.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>It would have been well if the action of this Court   
had been followed as an authoritative precedent.</p>   
<p>In the year 1679, the house of William Morse, of   
Newbury, was, for more than two months, infested in a   
most strange and vexatious manner. The affair was   
brought into court, where it played a conspicuous   
part, and was near reaching a tragical conclusion.   
The history of the proceedings in reference to it is   
very curious.</p>   
<p>Mr. John Woodbridge, of Newbury, had been for   
some time an associate county judge, and was commissioned to administer oaths and join persons in   
marriage. The following is a record of what occurred   
<pb n="439" id="vI439"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1484">   
<figDesc>Page 439.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
before him, sitting as a magistrate, and as a commissioner to adjudicate in small, local causes, and   
hold examinations in matters that went to higher   
courts: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Dec. 3, 1679. &mdash; Caleb Powell, being complained of for   
suspicion of working with the Devil to the molesting of   
William Morse and his family, was by warrant directed to   
the constable brought in by him. The accusation and testimonies were read, and the complaint respited till the Monday following.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Dec. 8, 1679. &mdash; Caleb Powell appeared according to   
order, and further testimony produced against him by   
William Morse, which being read and considered, it was   
determined that the said William Morse should prosecute   
the case against said Powell at the County Court to be held   
at Ipswich the last Tuesday in March ensuing; and, in order   
hereunto, William Morse acknowledgeth himself indebted   
to the Treasurer of the County of Essex the full sum of   
twenty pounds. The condition of this obligation is, that the   
said William Morse shall prosecute his complaint against   
Caleb Powell at that Court.</p>   
<p>Caleb Powell was delivered as a prisoner to the constable till he could find security of twenty pounds for the answering of the said complaint, or else he was to be carried   
to prison. Jo: <hi rend="smallcaps">Woodbridge,</hi> <hi rend="italics">Commissioner.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Powell was accordingly brought before the Court at   
Ipswich, March 30, 1680, under an indictment for   
witchcraft. Before giving the substance of the evidence adduced on this occasion, it will be well to   
mention the manner in which he got into the case as   
<pb n="440" id="vI440"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1485">   
<figDesc>Page 440.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
a principal. He was a mate of a vessel. While at   
home, between voyages, he happened to hear of the   
wonderful occurrences at Mr. Morse's house. His   
curiosity was awakened, and he was also actuated by   
feelings of commiseration for the family under the   
torments and terrors with which they were said to be   
afflicted. Determined to see what it all meant, and to   
put a stop to it if he could, he went to the house, and   
soon became satisfied that a roguish grandchild was   
the cause of all the trouble. He prevailed upon the   
old grandparents to let him take off the boy. Immediately upon his removal, the difficulty ceased.</p>   
<p>New-England navigators, at that time and long   
afterwards, sailed almost wholly by the stars; and   
Powell probably had often related his own skill, which,   
as mate of a vessel, he would have been likely to   
acquire, in calculating his position, rate of sailing,   
and distances, on the boundless and trackless ocean,   
by his knowledge and observations of the heavenly   
bodies. He had said, perhaps, that, by gazing among   
the stars, he could, at any hour of the night, however   
long or far he had been tossed and driven on the   
ocean, tell exactly where his vessel was. Hence the   
charge of being an astrologist. Probably, like other   
sailors, Powell may have indulged in &ldquo;long yarns&rdquo;   
to the country people, of the wonders he had seen,   
&ldquo;some in one country, and some in another.&rdquo; It   
is not unlikely, that, in foreign ports, he had witnessed exhibitions of necromancy and mesmerism,   
which, in various forms and under different names,   
<pb n="441" id="vI441"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1486">   
<figDesc>Page 441.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
have always been practised. Possibly he may have   
boasted to be a medium himself, a scholar and adept   
in the mystic art, able to read and divine &ldquo;the   
workings of spirits.&rdquo; At any rate, when it became   
known, that, at a glance, he attributed to the boy   
the cause of the mischief, and that it ceased on his   
taking him away from the house, the opinion became   
settled that he was a wizard. He was arrested forthwith, and brought to trial, as has been stated, for   
witchcraft. His astronomy, astrology, and spiritualism brought him in peril of his life.</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of William Morse:</hi> which saith,   
together with his wife, aged both about sixty-five years:   
that, Thursday night, being the twenty-seventh day of   
November, we heard a great noise without, round the house,   
of knocking the boards of the house, and, as we conceived,   
throwing of stones against the house. Whereupon myself   
and wife looked out and saw nobody, and the boy all this   
time with us; but we had stones and sticks thrown at us,   
that we were forced to retire into the house again. Afterwards we went to bed, and the boy with us; and then the   
like noise was upon the roof of the house.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;2. The same night about midnight, the door being   
locked when we went to bed, we heard a great hog in the   
house grunt and make a noise, as we thought willing to get   
out; and, that we might not be disturbed in our sleep, I rose   
to let him out, and I found a hog in the house and the door   
unlocked: the door was firmly locked when we went to   
bed.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;3. The next morning, a stick of links hanging in the   
chimney, they were thrown out of their place, and we

hanged them up again, and they were thrown down again,   
and some into the fire.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;4. The night following, I had a great awl lying in the   
window, the which awl we saw fall down out of the chimney   
into the ashes by the fire.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;5. After this, I bid the boy put the same awl into the   
cupboard, which we saw done, and the door shut to: this   
same awl came presently down the chimney again in our   
sight, and I took it up myself. Again, the same night, we   
saw a little Indian basket, that was in the loft before, come   
down the chimney again. And I took the same basket, and   
put a piece of brick into it, and the basket with the brick   
was gone, and came down again the third time with the   
brick in it, and went up again the fourth time, and came   
down again without the brick; and the brick came down   
again a little after.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;6. The next day, being Saturday, stones, sticks, and   
pieces of bricks came down, so that we could not quietly   
dress our breakfast; and sticks of fire also came down at the   
same time.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;7. That day in the afternoon, my thread four times taken   
away, and came down the chimney; again, my awl and gimlet, wanting, came down the chimney; again, my leather,   
taken away, came down the chimney; again, my nails, being   
in the cover of a firkin, taken away, came down the chimney. Again, the same night, the door being locked, a little   
before day, hearing a hog in the house, I rose, and saw the   
hog to be mine: I let him out.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;8. The next day being sabbath-day, many stones and   
sticks and pieces of bricks came down the chimney: on the   
Monday, Mr. Richardson and my brother being there, the   
frame of my cowhouse they saw very firm. I sent my boy   
<pb n="443" id="vI443"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1488">   
<figDesc>Page 443.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
out to scare the fowls from my hog's meat: he went to the   
cowhouse, and it fell down, my boy crying with the hurt of   
the fall. In the afternoon, the pots hanging over the fire did   
dash so vehemently one against the other, we set down one   
that they might not dash to pieces. I saw the andiron leap   
into the pot, and dance and leap out, and again leap in and   
dance and leap out again, and leap on a table and there   
abide, and my wife saw the andiron on the table: also I   
saw the pot turn itself over, and throw down all the water.   
Again, we saw a tray with wool leap up and down, and throw   
the wool out, and so many times, and saw nobody meddle   
with it. Again, a tub his hoop fly off of itself and the tub   
turn over, and nobody near it. Again, the woollen wheel   
turned upside down, and stood up on its end, and a spade   
set on it; Steph. Greenleafe saw it, and myself and my   
wife. Again, my rope-tools fell down upon the ground before my boy could take them, being sent for them; and the   
same thing of nails tumbled down from the loft into the   
ground, and nobody near. Again, my wife and boy making   
the bed, the chest did open and shut: the bed-clothes could   
not be made to lie on the bed, but fly off again.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Again, Caleb Powell came in, and, being affected to see   
our trouble, did promise me and my wife, that, if we would   
be willing to let him keep the boy, we should see ourselves   
that we should be never disturbed while he was gone with   
him: he had the boy, and had been quiet ever since.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Tho. Rogers</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">George Hardy,</hi> being at William   
Morse his house, affirm that the earth in the chimney-corner   
moved, and scattered on them; that Tho. Rogers was hit   
with somewhat, Hardy with an iron ladle as is supposed.   
Somewhat hit William Morse a great blow, but it was so   
swift that they could not certainly tell what it was; but,

looking down after they heard the noise, they saw a shoe.   
The boy was in the corner at the first, afterwards in the   
house.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Richardson</hi> on Saturday testifieth that a board   
flew against his chair, and he heard a noise in another room,   
which he supposed in all reason to be diabolical.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">John Dole</hi> saw a pine stick of candlewood to fall   
down, a stone, a firebrand; and these things he saw not   
what way they came, till they fell down by him.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;The same affirmed by John Tucker: the boy was in   
one corner, whom they saw and observed all the while, and   
saw no motion in him.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Elizabeth Titcomb</hi> affirmeth that Powell said that he   
could find the witch by his learning, if he had another   
scholar with him: this she saith were his expressions, to   
the best of her memory.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Jo. Tucker</hi> affirmeth that Powell said to him, he saw   
the boy throw the shoe while he was at prayer.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Jo. Emerson</hi> affirmeth that Powell said he was brought   
up under Norwood; and it was judged by the people there,   
that Norwood studied the black art.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">A further Testimony of William Morse and his   
Wife.</hi> &mdash; We saw a keeler of bread turn over against me,   
and struck me, not any being near it, and so overturned. I   
saw a chair standing in the house, and not anybody near: it   
did often bow towards me, and so rise up again. My wife   
also being in the chamber, the chamber-door did violently fly   
together, not anybody being near it. My wife, going to make   
a bed, it did move to and fro, not anybody being near it. I   
also saw an iron wedge and spade was flying out of the   
chamber on my wife, and did not strike her. My wife   
going into the cellar, a drum, standing in the house, did roll   
<pb n="445" id="vI445"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1490">   
<figDesc>Page 445.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
over the door of the cellar; and, being taken up again, the   
door did violently fly down again. My barn-doors four times   
unpinned, I know not how. I, going to shut my barn-door,   
looking for the pin, &mdash; the boy being with me, as I did judge,   
&mdash; the pin, coming down out of the air, did fall down near   
to me. Again, Caleb Powell came in, as beforesaid, and,   
seeing our spirits very low by the sence of our great affliction, began to bemoan our condition, and said that he was   
troubled for our afflictions, and said that he had eyed this boy,   
and drawed near to us with great compassion: `Poor old   
man, poor old woman! this boy is the occasion of your grief;   
for he hath done these things, and hath caused his good old   
grandmother to be counted a witch.' `Then,' said I, `how   
can all these things be done by him?' Said he, `Although   
he may not have done all, yet most of them; for this boy is   
a young rogue, a vile rogue: I have watched him, and see   
him do things as to come up and down.' Caleb Powell also   
said he had understanding in astrology and astronomy, and   
knew the working of spirits, some in one country, and some   
in another; and, looking on the boy, said, `You young   
rogue, to begin so soon. Goodman Morse, if you be willing   
to let me have this boy, I will undertake you shall be free   
from any trouble of this kind while he is with me.' I was   
very unwilling at the first, and my wife; but, by often urging   
me, till he told me whither, and what employment and company, he should go, I did consent to it, and this was before   
Jo. Badger came; and we have been freed from any trouble   
of this kind ever since that promise, made on Monday night   
last, to this time, being Friday in the afternoon. Then we   
heard a great noise in the other room, oftentimes, but, looking after it, could not see any thing; but, afterwards looking   
into the room, we saw a board hanged to the press. Then

<figDesc>Page 446.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
we, being by the fire, sitting in a chair, my chair often would   
not stand still, but ready to throw me backward oftentimes.   
Afterward, my cap almost taken off my head three times.   
Again, a great blow on my poll, and my cat did leap from   
me into the chimney corner. Presently after, this cat was   
thrown at my wife. We saw the cat to be ours: we put her   
out of the house, and shut the door. Presently, the cat was   
throwed into the house. We went to go to bed. Suddenly, &mdash;   
my wife being with me in bed, the lamp-light by our side, &mdash;   
my cat again throwed at us five times, jumping away presently into the floor; and, one of those times, a red waistcoat   
throwed on the bed, and the cat wrapped up in it. Again,   
the lamp, standing by us on the chest, we said it should stand   
and burn out; but presently was beaten down, and all the   
oil shed, and we left in the dark. Again, a great voice, a   
great while, very dreadful. Again, in the morning, a great   
stone, being six-pound weight, did remove from place to place,   
&mdash; we saw it, &mdash; two spoons throwed off the table, and presently the table throwed down. And, being minded to write,   
my inkhorn was hid from me, which I found, covered with   
a rag, and my pen quite gone. I made a new pen; and,   
while I was writing, one ear of corn hit me in the face, and   
fire, sticks, and stones throwed at me, and my pen brought to   
me. While I was writing with my new pen, my inkhorn   
taken away: and, not knowing how to write any more, we   
looked under the table, and there found him; and so I was   
able to write again. Again, my wife her hat taken from her   
head, sitting by the fire by me, the table almost thrown   
down. Again, my spectacles thrown from the table, and   
thrown almost into the fire by me, and my wife and the boy.   
Again, my book of all my accounts thrown into the fire, and   
had been burnt presently, if I had not taken it up. Again,   
<pb n="447" id="vI447"/>

</figure>   
boards taken off a tub, and set upright by themselves; and   
my paper, do what I could, hardly keep it while I was writing this relation, and things thrown at me while a-writing.   
Presently, before I could dry my writing, a mormouth hat   
rubbed along it; but I held so fast that it did blot but some   
of it. My wife and I, being much afraid that I should not   
preserve it for public use, did think best to lay it in the   
Bible, and it lay safe that night. Again, the next, I would   
lay it there again; but, in the morning, it was not there to   
be found, the bag hanged down empty; but, after, was found   
in a box alone. Again, while I was writing this morning, I   
was forced to forbear writing any more, I was so disturbed   
with so many things constantly thrown at me.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;This relation brought in Dec. 8.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;I, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthony Morse,</hi> occasionally being at my brother   
Morse's house, my brother showed me a piece of a brick   
which had several times come down the chimney. I sitting   
in the corner, I took the piece of brick in my hand. Within   
a little space of time, the piece of brick was gone from me,   
I knew not by what means. Quickly after, the piece of   
brick came down the chimney. Also, in the chimney I saw a hammer on the ground: there being no person near the hammer, it was suddenly gone, by what means   
I know not. But, within a little space after, the hammer   
came down the chimney. And, within a little space of time   
after that, came a piece of wood down the chimney, about a   
foot long; and, within a little after that, came down a firebrand, the fire being out. This was about ten days ago.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">John Badger</hi> affirmeth, that, being at William Morse   
his house, and heard Caleb Powell say that he thought by   
astrology, and I think he said by astronomy too, with it,   
he could find out whether or no there were diabolical means   
<pb n="448" id="vI448"/>

<figDesc>Page 448.</figDesc>

used about the said Morse his trouble, and that the said Caleb   
said he thought to try to find it out.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Mary Tucker,</hi> aged about twenty.   
&mdash; She remembered that Caleb Powell came into her house,   
and said to this purpose: That he, coming to William Morse   
his house, and the old man, being at prayer, he thought not fit   
to go in, but looked in at the window; and he said he had   
broken the enchantment; for he saw the boy play tricks while   
he was at prayer, and mentioned some, and, among the rest,   
that he saw him to fling the shoe at the said Morse's head.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Taken on oath, March 29, 1680, before me,</p>   
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Jo: Woodbridge,</hi> <hi rend="italics">Commissioner.</hi></p>   
<p>&ldquo;Mary Richardson confirmed the truth of the above written testimony, on oath, at the same time.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>There seem to have been several hearings before   
Commissioner Woodbridge. The boy had returned   
to his grandparents before the last deposition of William Morse, and his audacious operations were persisted in to the last. The final decision of the Court   
was as follows: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;Upon the hearing the complaint brought to this Court   
against Caleb Powell for suspicion of working by the Devil   
to the molesting of the family of William Morse of Newbury, though this court cannot find any evident ground of   
proceeding further against the said Caleb Powell, yet we   
determine that he hath given such ground of suspicion of   
his so dealing that we cannot so acquit him, but that he   
justly deserves to bear his own share and the costs of the   
prosecution of the complaint.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;Referred to Mr. Woodbridge to examine and determine   
the charges.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<pb n="449" id="vI449"/>   
<p>   
<figure entity="Uphv1494">   
<figDesc>Page 449.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
</p>   
<p>The entry of this sentence, in the records of the   
County Court, is as follows; the clerk strangely mistaking the name of the party: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The Court held at Ipswich, the 30th of March, 1680.</p>   
<p>&ldquo;In the case of Abell Powell, though the Court do not   
see sufficient to charge further, yet find so much suspicion   
as that he pay the charges. The ordering of the charges   
left to Mr. Jo: Woodbridge.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The matter of Powell's connection with the affair   
being thus disposed of, and no one seeming to entertain his idea of the guilt of the boy, the next step was   
to fasten suspicion upon the good old grandmother;   
and a general outcry was raised against her. Her   
arrest and condemnation were clamored for. But the   
result of Powell's trial, and all preceding cases, showed   
that an Essex jury could not yet be relied on for a   
conviction in witchcraft cases; and it was resolved to   
institute proceedings in a more favorable quarter.   
The Grand Jury returned a bill of indictment against   
her to the Court of Assistants, sitting in Boston.   
This was the highest tribunal in the country, subject   
only to the General Court, and embracing the whole   
colony in its jurisdiction. The following is the substance of the record of the case: &mdash;</p>   
<p>At a Court of Assistants, on adjournment, held at   
Boston, on the 20th of May, 1680.</p>   
<p>The Grand Jury having presented Elizabeth Morse,   
wife of William Morse, she was tried and convicted of   
the crime of witchcraft. The Governor, on the 27th   
<pb n="450" id="vI450"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1495">   
<figDesc>Page 450.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of May, &ldquo;after the lecture,&rdquo; in the First Church of   
Boston, pronounced the sentence of death upon her.   
On the 1st of June, the Governor and Assistants voted   
to reprieve her &ldquo;until the next session of the Court in   
Boston.&rdquo; At the said next session, the reprieval was   
still further continued. This seems to have produced   
much dissatisfaction, as is shown by the following extract from the records of the House of Deputies: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;The Deputies, on perusal of the Acts of the Honored   
Court of Assistants, relating to the woman condemned for   
witchcraft, do not understand the reason why the sentence,   
given against her by said Court, is not executed: and the   
second reprieval seems to us beyond what the law will   
allow, and do therefore judge meet to declare ourselves   
against it, with reference to the concurrence of the honored   
magistrates hereto.</p>   
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">William Torrey,</hi> <hi rend="italics">Clerk.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The action of the magistrates, on this reference, is   
recorded as follows: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;3d of November, 1680. &mdash; Not consented to by magistrates.</p>   
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Rawson,</hi> <hi rend="italics">Secretary.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>The evidence against Mrs. Morse was frivolous to   
the last degree, without any of the force and effect   
given to support the prosecutions in Salem, twelve   
years afterwards, by the astounding confessions of the   
accused, and the splendid acting of the &ldquo;afflicted   
children;&rdquo; yet she was tried and condemned in Boston, and sentenced there on &ldquo;Lecture-day.&rdquo; The   
representatives of the people, in the House of Deputies, cried out against her reprieve. She was saved   
<pb n="451" id="vI451"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1496">   
<figDesc>Page 451.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
by the courage and wisdom of Governor Bradstreet,   
subsequently a resident of Salem, where his ashes   
rest. He was living here, at the age of ninety years,   
during the witchcraft prosecutions in 1692; but, old   
as he was, he made known his entire disapprobation   
of them. It is safe to say, that, if he had not been   
superseded by the arrival of Sir William Phipps as   
governor under the new charter, they would never   
have taken place. Notwithstanding all this, &mdash; in spite   
of the remonstrances, at the time, of Brattle, and   
afterwards of Hutchinson, &mdash; Boston and other towns   
(earlier, if not equally, committed to such proceedings)   
have, by a sort of general conspiracy, joined the rest of   
the world in trying to throw and fasten the whole   
responsibility and disgrace of witchcraft prosecutions   
upon Salem.</p>   
<p>Things continued in the condition just described, &mdash;   
Mrs. Morse in jail under sentence of death; that sentence suspended by reprieves from the Governor, from   
time to time, until the next year, when her husband,   
in her behalf and in her name, presented an earnest   
and touching petition &ldquo;to the honored Governor,   
Deputy-governor, Magistrates, and Deputies now assembled in Court, May the 18th, 1681,&rdquo; that her   
case might be concluded, one way or another. After   
referring to her condemnation, and to her attestation   
of innocence, she says, &ldquo;By the mercy of God, and   
the goodness of the honored Governor, I am reprieved.&rdquo;   
She begs the Court to &ldquo;hearken to her cry, a poor prisoner.&rdquo; She places herself at the foot of the tribunal   
<pb n="452" id="vI452"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1497">   
<figDesc>Page 452.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
of the General Court: &ldquo;I now stand humbly praying   
your justice in hearing my case, and to determine   
therein as the Lord shall direct. I do not understand   
law, nor do I know how to lay my case before you as   
I ought; for want of which I humbly beg of your   
honors that my request may not be rejected.&rdquo; The   
House of Deputies, on the 24th of May, voted to give   
her a new trial. But the magistrates refused to concur in the vote; and so the matter stood, for how   
long a time there are, I believe, no means of knowing.   
Finally, however, she was released from prison, and   
allowed to return to her own house. This we learn   
from a publication made by Mr. Hale, of Beverly, in   
1697. It seems, that, after getting her out of prison   
and restored to her home, to use Mr. Hale's words,   
&ldquo;her husband, who was esteemed a sincere and understanding Christian by those that knew him, desired   
some neighbor ministers, of whom I was one, to discourse his wife, which we did; and her discourse was   
very Christian, and still pleaded her innocence as to   
that which was laid to her charge.&rdquo; From Mr. Hale's   
language, it may be inferred that she had not been   
pardoned or discharged, but still lay under sentence   
of death, after her removal to her own house: for he   
and his brethren did not &ldquo;esteem it prudence to pass   
any definite sentence upon one under her circumstances;&rdquo; but they ventured to say that they were   
&ldquo;inclined to the more charitable side.&rdquo; Mr. Hale   
states, that, &ldquo;in her last sickness, she was in much   
trouble and darkness of spirit, which occasioned a   
<pb n="453" id="vI453"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1498">   
<figDesc>Page 453.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
judicious friend to examine her strictly, whether she   
had been guilty of witchcraft; but she said <hi rend="italics">no,</hi> but the   
ground of her trouble was some impatient and passionate speeches and actions of hers while in prison,   
upon the account of her suffering wrongfully, whereby   
she had provoked the Lord by putting contempt upon   
his Word. And, in fine, she sought her pardon and   
comfort from God in Christ; and died, so far as I   
understand, praying to and relying upon God in   
Christ for salvation.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>The cases of Margaret Jones, Ann Hibbins, and   
Elizabeth Morse illustrate strikingly and fully the history and condition of the public mind in New England, and the world over, in reference to witchcraft in   
the seventeenth century. They show that there was   
nothing unprecedented, unusual, or eminently shocking, after all, in what I am about to relate as occurring in Salem, in 1692. The only real offence proved   
upon Margaret Jones was that she was a successful   
practitioner of medicine, using only simple remedies.   
Ann Hibbins was the victim of the slanderous gossip   
of a prejudiced neighborhood; all our actual knowledge of her being her Will, which proves that she was   
a person of much more than ordinary dignity of mind,   
which was kept unruffled and serene in the bitterest   
trials and most outrageous wrongs which it is possible   
for folly and &ldquo;man's inhumanity to man&rdquo; to bring   
upon us in this life. Elizabeth Morse appears to have   
been one of the best of Christian women. The accusations against them, as a whole, cover nearly the   
<pb n="454" id="vI454"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1499">   
<figDesc>Page 454.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
whole ground upon which the subsequent prosecutions   
in Salem rested. John Winthrop passed sentence upon   
Margaret Jones, John Endicott upon Ann Hibbins,   
and Simon Bradstreet upon Elizabeth Morse. The   
last-named governor performed the office as an unavoidable act of official duty, and prevented the execution of the sentence by the courageous use of his   
prerogative, in defiance of public clamor and the   
wrath of the representatives of the whole people of   
the colony. These facts sufficiently show, that the   
proceedings afterwards had in Salem accorded with   
those in like cases, of that and preceding generations;   
and were sanctioned by the all but universal sentiments of mankind and a uniform chain of precedents.</p>   
<p>The trial of Bridget Bishop, in 1680, before the   
County Court at Salem, for witchcraft, and her acquittal, have already been mentioned in the account of   
Salem Village, in the First Part.</p>   
<p>In 1688, an Irish woman, named Glover, was executed in Boston for bewitching four children belonging to the family of a Mr. Goodwin. She was a Roman   
Catholic, represented to have been quite an ignorant   
person, and seems, moreover, from the accounts given   
of her, to have been crazy. The oldest of the children   
was only about thirteen years of age. The most   
experienced physicians pronounced them bewitched.   
Their conduct, as it is related by Cotton Mather, was   
indeed very extraordinary. At one time they would   
bark like dogs, and then again they would purr like   
<pb n="455" id="vI455"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1500">   
<figDesc>Page 455.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
cats. &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;they would fly like geese,   
and be carried with an incredible swiftness, having   
but just their toes now and then upon the ground,   
sometimes not once in twenty feet, and their arms   
waved like the wings of a bird.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>One of the children seems to have had a genius   
scarcely inferior to that of Master Burke himself:   
there was no part nor passion she could not enact.   
She would complain that the old Irish woman had tied   
an invisible noose round her neck, and was choking   
her; and her complexion and features would instantly assume the various hues and violent distortions   
natural to a person in such a predicament. She   
would declare that an invisible chain was fastened to   
one of her limbs, and would limp about precisely as   
though it were really the case. She would say that   
she was in an oven; the perspiration would drop from   
her face, and she would exhibit every appearance of   
being roasted: then she would cry out that cold water   
was thrown upon her, and her whole frame would   
shiver and shake. She pretended that the evil spirit   
came to her in the shape of an invisible horse; and   
she would canter, gallop, trot, and amble round the   
rooms and entries in such admirable imitation, that an   
observer could hardly believe that a horse was not   
beneath her, and bearing her about. She would go   
up stairs with exactly such a toss and bound as a   
person on horseback would exhibit.</p>   
<p>After some time, Cotton Mather took her into his   
own family, to see whether he could not exorcise her.

His account of her conduct, while there, is highly   
amusing for its credulous simplicity. The cunning   
and ingenious child seems to have taken great delight   
in perplexing and playing off her tricks upon the   
learned man. Once he wished to say something in   
her presence, to a third person, which he did not   
intend she should understand. He accordingly spoke   
in Latin. But she had penetration enough to conjecture what he had said: he was amazed. He then   
tried Greek: she was equally successful. He next   
spoke in Hebrew: she instantly detected the meaning.   
At last he resorted to the Indian language, and that   
she pretended not to know. He drew the conclusion   
that the evil being with whom she was in compact was   
acquainted familiarly with the Latin, Greek, and   
Hebrew, but not with the Indian tongue.</p>   
<p>It is curious to notice how adroitly she fell into the   
line of his prejudices. He handed her a book written   
by a Quaker, to which sect it is well known he was   
violently opposed: she would read it off with great   
ease, rapidity, and pleasure. A book written against   
the Quakers she could not read at all. She could   
read Popish books, but could not decipher a syllable   
of the Assembly's Catechism. Dr. Mather was earnestly opposed to the order and liturgy of the Church   
of England. The artful little girl worked with great   
success upon this prejudice. She pretended to be   
very fond of the Book of Common Prayer, and called   
it her Bible. It would relieve her of her sufferings, in   
a moment, to put it into her hands. While she could   
<pb n="457" id="vI457"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1502">   
<figDesc>Page 457.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
not read a word of the Scriptures in the Bible, she   
could read them very easily in the Prayer-book; but   
she could not read the Lord's Prayer even in this   
her favorite volume. All these things went far to   
strengthen the conviction of Dr. Mather that she was   
in league with the Devil; for this was the only explanation that could be given to satisfy his mind of her   
partiality to the productions of Quakers, Catholics,   
and Episcopalians, and her aversion to the Bible and   
the Catechism.</p>   
<p>She exhibited the most exquisite ingenuity in beguiling Dr. Mather by the force of a charm, the power   
of which he could not resist for a moment, &mdash; flattery.   
He thus describes, with a complacency but thinly concealed under the veil of affected modesty, the part she   
played, in order to give the impression &mdash; which it was   
the great object of his ambition to make upon the public mind &mdash; that the Devil stood in special fear of his   
presence: &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;There then stood open the study of one belonging to   
the family, into which, entering, she stood immediately on   
her feet, and cried out, `They are gone! they are gone!   
They say that they cannot, &mdash; God won't let 'em come here!'   
adding a reason for it which the owner of the study thought   
more kind than true; and she presently and perfectly came   
to herself, so that her whole discourse and carriage was   
altered into the greatest measure of sobriety.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Upon quitting the study, &ldquo;the demons&rdquo; would instantly again take hold of her. Mather continues the   
statement, by saying that some persons, wishing to try   
<pb n="458" id="vI458"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1503">   
<figDesc>Page 458.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the experiment, had her brought &ldquo;up into the study;&rdquo;   
but he says that she at once became &mdash;</p>   
<q><p>&ldquo;so strangely distorted, that it was an extreme difficulty   
to drag her up stairs. The demons would pull her out of the   
people's hands, and make her heavier than, perhaps, three of   
herself. With incredible toil (though she kept screaming,   
`They say I must not go in'), she was pulled in; where she   
was no sooner got, but she could stand on her feet, and, with   
altered note, say, `Now I am well.' She would be faint at   
first, and say `she felt something to go out of her' (the   
noises whereof we sometimes heard like those of a mouse);   
but, in a minute or two, she could apply herself to devotion.   
To satisfy some strangers, the experiment was, divers times,   
with the same success, repeated, until my lothness to have any   
thing done like making a charm of a room, caused me to   
forbid the repetition of it.&rdquo;</p></q>   
<p>Even in her most riotous proceedings, she kept her   
eye fixed upon the doctor's weak point. When he   
called the family to prayers, she would whistle and   
sing and yell to drown his voice, would strike him   
with her fist, and try to kick him. But her hand or   
foot would always recoil when within an inch or two   
of his body; thus giving the idea that there was a sort   
of invisible coat of mail, of heavenly temper, and proof   
against the assaults of the Devil, around his sacred   
person! After a while, Dr. Mather concluded to prepare an account of these extraordinary circumstances,   
wherewithal to entertain his congregation in a sermon.   
She seemed to be quite displeased at the thought of   
his making public the doings of her master, the Evil   
<pb n="459" id="vI459"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1504">   
<figDesc>Page 459.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
One, attempted to prevent his writing the intended   
sermon, and disturbed and interrupted him in all   
manner of ways. For instance, she once knocked at   
his study door, and said that &ldquo;there was somebody   
down stairs that would be glad to see him.&rdquo; He   
dropped his pen, and went down. Upon entering the   
room, he found nobody there but the family. The   
next time he met her, he undertook to chide her for   
having told him a falsehood. She denied that she had   
told a falsehood. &ldquo;Didn't you say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that   
there was somebody down stairs that would be glad to   
see me?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, with inimitable pertness, &ldquo;is not Mrs. Mather always glad to see you?&rdquo;</p>   
<p>She even went much farther than this in persecuting   
the good man while he was writing his sermon: she   
threw large books at his head. But he struggled   
manfully against these buffetings of Satan, as he considered her conduct to be, finished the sermon, related   
all these circumstances in it, preached, and published   
it. Richard Baxter wrote the preface to an edition   
printed in London, in which he declares that he who   
will not be convinced by all the evidence Dr. Mather   
presents that the child was bewitched &ldquo;must be a   
very obdurate Sadducee.&rdquo; It is so obvious, that, in   
this whole affair, Cotton Mather was grossly deceived   
and audaciously imposed upon by the most consummate and precocious cunning, that it needs no comment. I have given this particular account of it,   
because there is reason to believe that it originated   
the delusion in Salem. It occurred only four years   
<pb n="460" id="vI460"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1505">   
<figDesc>Page 460.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
before. Dr. Mather's account of the transaction filled   
the whole country; and it is probable that the children   
in Mr. Parris's family undertook to re-enact it.</p>   
<p>There is nothing in the annals of the histrionic art   
more illustrative of the infinite versatility of the human   
faculties, both physical and mental, and of the amazing extent to which cunning, ingenuity, contrivance,   
quickness of invention, and presence of mind can be   
cultivated, even in very young persons, than such   
cases as this just related. It seems, at first, incredible   
that a mere child could carry on such a complex piece   
of fraud and imposture as that enacted by the little   
girl whose achievements have been immortalized by   
the famous author of the &ldquo;Magnalia.&rdquo; Many other   
instances, however, are found recorded in the history   
of the delusion we are discussing.</p>   
<p>That of the grandchild of William and Elizabeth   
Morse, in Newbury, was nearly as marvellous, and   
perfectly successful in deceiving the whole country   
except Caleb Powell; and he got into much trouble in   
consequence of seeing through it. A similar instance   
of juvenile imposture is related as having occurred at   
Amsterdam in 1560. Twenty or thirty boys pretended   
to be suddenly seized with a kind of rage and fury,   
were cast upon the ground, and tormented with great   
agony. These fits were intermittent; and, when they   
had passed off, their subjects did not seem to be conscious of what had taken place. While they lasted,   
the boys threw up, apparently from their stomachs,   
large quantities of needles, pins, thimbles, pieces of   
<pb n="461" id="vI461"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1506">   
<figDesc>Page 461.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
cloth, fragments of pots and kettles, bits of glass,   
locks of hair, and a variety of other articles. There   
was no doubt, at the time, that they were suffering   
under the influence of the Devil; and multitudes   
crowded round them, and gazed upon them with wonder and horror.</p>   
<p>The details of the cases in Newbury and Charlestown were dressed up by Cotton Mather and other   
writers in the strongest colors that credulous superstition and the peculiar views of that age on the   
subject of demonology could employ. They were   
almost universally received as proof that Satan had   
commenced an onslaught, such as had never before   
been known, upon the Church and the world! They   
appear to us as simply absurd, and the result of precocious knavery; not so to the people of that generation.   
They were looked upon as fearful demonstrations of   
diabolical power, and preludes to the coming of Satan,   
with his infernal confederates, to overwhelm the land.   
The imaginations of all were excited, and their apprehensions morbidly aroused. The very air was filled   
with rumors, fancies, and fears. The ministers   
sounded the alarm from their pulpits. The magistrates sharpened the sword of justice. The deputy of the colony, Danforth, began to arrest   
suspected persons months before proceedings commenced, or were thought of, in Salem Village. It was   
believed that evil spirits had been seen, by men's   
bodily eyes, in a neighboring town. They glided over   
the fields, hovered around the houses, appeared, vanished,   
<pb n="462" id="vI462"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1507">   
<figDesc>Page 462.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and re-appeared on the outskirts of the woods,   
in the vicinity of Gloucester. Their movements were   
observed by several of the inhabitants; and the whole   
population of the Cape was kept in a state of agitation   
and alarm, in consequence of the mysterious phenomena, for three weeks. The inhabitants retired to the   
garrison, and put themselves in a state of defence   
against the diabolical besiegers. Sixty men were despatched from Ipswich, in military array, to re-enforce   
the garrison, and several valiant sallies were made   
from its walls. Much powder was expended, but no   
corporeal or incorporeal blood was shed. An account   
of these events was drawn up by the Rev. John Emerson, then the minister of the first parish in Gloucester,   
from which the facts now mentioned have been selected. It is very minute and particular. The   
appearance and dress of the supernatural enemies are   
described. They wore white waistcoats, blue shirts,   
and white breeches, and had bushy heads of black   
hair. Mr. Emerson concludes his account by expressing the hope that &ldquo;all rational persons will be satisfied   
that Gloucester was not alarmed last summer for   
above a fortnight together by real French and Indians,   
but that the Devil and his agents were the cause of all   
the molestation which at this time befell the town.&rdquo;</p>   
<p>These wonderful things took place at Cape Ann,   
about the time that the great conflict between the   
Devil and his confederates on the one hand, and the   
ministers and magistrates on the other, at Salem Village, was reaching its height. It is said that it was   
<pb n="463" id="vI463"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1508">   
<figDesc>Page 463.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
regarded by the most considerate persons, at the time,   
as an artful contrivance of the Devil to create a diversion of the attention of the pious colonists from his   
operations through the witches in Salem, and, by   
dividing and distracting their forces, to obtain an   
advantage over them in the war he was waging   
against their churches and their religion.</p>   
<p>We are now ready to enter upon the story of Salem   
witchcraft. We have endeavored to become acquainted   
with the people who acted conspicuous parts in the   
drama, and to understand their character; and have   
tried to collect, and bring into appreciating view, the   
opinions and theories, the habits of thought, the associations of mind, the passions, impulses, and fantasies that guided, moulded, and controlled their conduct.   
The law, literature, and theology of the age, as they   
bore on the subject, have been brought before us.   
The last great display of the effects of the doctrines   
of demonology, of the belief of the agency of invisible,   
irresponsible beings, whether fallen angels or departed   
spirits, upon the actions of men and human affairs, is   
now to open before us. The final results of superstitions and fables and fancies, accumulating through the   
ages, are to be exhibited in a transaction, an actual   
demonstration in real life. They are to present an   
exemplification that will at once fully display their   
power, and deal their death-blow.</p>   
<p>Without the least purpose or wish to cover up or   
extenuate the follies, excesses, or outrages I am about   
<pb n="464" id="vI464"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1509">   
<figDesc>Page 464.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
to describe, into which the community suffered itself   
to be led in the witchcraft proceedings of 1692, &mdash;   
with a desire, on the contrary, to make the lesson then   
given of the mischief resulting from misguided enthusiasm, and which will always result when popular excitement is allowed to wield the organized powers of   
society, as impressive as facts and truth will justify,   
&mdash; I feel bound to say, in advance, that there are some   
considerations which we must keep before us, while reviewing the incidents of the transaction. The theological, legal, and philosophical doctrines and the popular   
beliefs, on which it was founded, have, as I have shown,   
led, in other countries and periods, to similar, and often   
vastly more shameful, cruel, and destructive results.   
But there was something in the affair, as it was developed here, that has arrested the notice of mankind,   
and clothed it with an inherent interest, beyond all   
other events of the kind that have elsewhere or ever   
occurred.</p>   
<p>The moral force engendered in the civilization planted on these shores, and pervading the whole body of   
society, supplied a mightier momentum, as it does   
to this day, and ever will, to the movement of the   
people, acting in a mass and as a unit, than can anywhere else be found. A population, invigorated by   
hardy enterprise, and the constant exercise of all the   
faculties of freedom, and actuated throughout by individual energy of character, must be mightier in motion than any other people. Such a population multiplies tenfold its physical forces, by the addition of   
<pb n="465" id="vI465"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1510">   
<figDesc>Page 465.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
moral and intellectual energies. The men of the day   
and scene we are now to contemplate, however deluded, to whatever extremities carried, were controlled   
by fixed, absolute, sharply defined, and, in themselves,   
great ideas. They believed in God. They also believed in the Devil. They bowed in an adoration that   
penetrated their inmost souls, before the one as a   
being of infinite holiness: they regarded the other   
as a being of an all but infinite power of evil. They   
feared and worshipped God. They hated and defied   
the Devil. They believed that Satan was waging war   
against Jehovah, and that the conflict was for the dominion of the world, for the establishment or the overthrow of the Church of Christ. The battle, they fully   
believed, could have no other issue than the salvation   
or the ruin of the souls of men. This was not, with   
them, a mere technical, verbal creed. It was a deepseated conviction, held earnestly with a clear and distinct apprehension of its import, by every individual   
mind. For this warfare, they put on the whole armor   
of faith, rallied to the banner of the Most High, and   
met Satan face to face. In this one great idea, a stern,   
determined, unflinching, all-sacrificing people concentrated their strength. No wonder that the conflict   
reached a magnitude which made it observable to the   
whole country and all countries at the time, and   
will make it memorable throughout all time. Those   
engaged in it, with this sentiment absorbing their very   
souls, passed, for the time, out of the realm of all other   
sentiments, and were insensible to all other considerations.   
<pb n="466" id="vI466"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1511">   
<figDesc>Page 466.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
The nearer and dearer the relatives, the higher   
and more conspicuous the persons, who, in their belief, were in league with the Devil, the more profound   
the abhorrence of their crime, and the determination   
to cut off and destroy them utterly. They believed   
that Satan had, once before, &ldquo;against the throne and   
monarchy of God, raised impious war and battle   
proud;&rdquo; and that for this he had been cast out from   
&ldquo;heaven, with all his host of rebel angels;&rdquo; that he,   
with his army of subordinate wicked spirits, was making a desperate effort to retrieve his lost estate, by a   
renewed rebellion against God; and they were determined to drive him, and all his confederates, for ever   
from the confines of the earth. The humble hamlet   
of Salem Village was felt to be the great and final   
battle-ground. However wild and absurd this idea is   
now regarded, it was then sincerely and thoroughly   
entertained, and must be taken into the account, in   
coming to a just estimate of the character of the transaction, and of those engaged in it.</p>   
<p>One other thought is to be borne in mind, as we   
pass through the scenes that are to be spread before   
us. The theology of Christendom, at that time, so far   
as it relates to the power and agency of Satan and demonology in general, &mdash; and this is the only point of   
view on which I ever refer to theology in this discussion, &mdash; and the whole fabric of popular superstitions   
founded upon it, had reached their culmination. The   
beginning, middle, and close of the seventeenth century, witnessed the greatest display of those superstitions,   
<pb n="467" id="vI467"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1512">   
<figDesc>Page 467.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
and prepared the way for their final explosion.   
As the hour of their dissolution was at hand, and they   
were doomed to vanish before the light of science and   
education, to pass from the realm of supposed reality   
into that of acknowledged fiction, it seems to have been   
ordered that they should leave monuments behind   
them, from which their character, elements, and features, and their terrible influence, might be read and   
studied in all subsequent ages.</p>   
<p>The ideas in reference to the agency and designs of   
the great enemy of God and man, and all his subordinate hosts, witches, fairies, ghosts, &ldquo;gorgons and hydras, and chimeras dire,&rdquo; &ldquo;apparitions, signs, and   
prodigies,&rdquo; by which the minds of men had so long   
been filled, and their fearful imaginations exercised,   
as they took their flight, imprinted themselves, for   
perpetual remembrance, in productions which, more   
than any works of mere human genius, are sure to   
live for ever. They left their forms crystallized, with   
imperishable lineaments, in the greatest of dramas   
and the greatest of epics. The plays of Shakespeare,   
as the century opened, and the verse of Milton in its   
central period, are their record and their picture.</p>   
<p>But there was another shape and aspect in which it   
was pre-eminently important to have their memory   
preserved; and that was their application to life, their   
influence upon the conduct of men, the action of tribunals, and the movements of society, and, in general,   
their effects, when allowed full operation, upon human   
happiness and welfare. This want was supplied, as   
<pb n="468" id="vI468"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1513">   
<figDesc>Page 468.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
the century terminated, by the tragedy in real life,   
whose scenes are now to be presented in <hi rend="smallcaps">Witchcraft   
at Salem Village.</hi></p>   
<p>However strange it seems, it is quite worthy of   
observation, that the actors in that tragedy, the   
&ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; and other witnesses, in their   
various statements and operations, embraced about   
the whole circle of popular superstition. How those   
young country girls, some of them mere children,   
most of them wholly illiterate, could have become   
familiar with such fancies, to such an extent, is truly   
surprising. They acted out, and brought to bear with   
tremendous effect, almost all that can be found in the   
literature of that day, and the period preceding it, relating to such subjects. Images and visions which   
had been portrayed in tales of romance, and given   
interest to the pages of poetry, will be made by them,   
as we shall see, to throng the woods, flit through the   
air, and hover over the heads of a terrified court.   
The ghosts of murdered wives and children will play   
their parts with a vividness of representation and   
artistic skill of expression that have hardly been surpassed in scenic representations on the stage. In the   
Salem-witchcraft proceedings, the superstition of the   
middle ages was embodied in real action. All its   
extravagances, absurdities, and monstrosities appear   
in their application to human experience. We see what   
the effect has been, and must be, when the affairs of   
life, in courts of law and the relations of society, or   
the conduct or feelings of individuals, are suffered to   
<pb n="469" id="vI469"/>   
<figure entity="Uphv1514">   
<figDesc>Page 469.</figDesc>   
</figure>   
be under the control of fanciful or mystical notions.   
When a whole people abandons the solid ground of   
common sense, overleaps the boundaries of human   
knowledge, gives itself up to wild reveries, and lets   
loose its passions without restraint, it presents a spectacle more terrific to behold, and becomes more destructive and disastrous, than any convulsion of mere   
material nature; than tornado, conflagration, or earthquake.</p>
