<p>WE left Mr. Parris in the early part of November,  
1691, at the crisis of his controversy with the  
inhabitants of Salem Village, under circumstances  
which seemed to indicate that its termination was  
near at hand. The opposition to him had assumed a  
form which made it quite probable that it would succeed  
in dislodging him from his position. But the end was  
not yet. Events were ripening that were to give him a  
new and fearful strength, and open a scene in which he  
was to act a part destined to attract the notice of the  
world, and become a permanent portion of human history. The doctrines of demonology had produced their  
full effect upon the minds of men, and every thing was  
ready for a final display of their power. The story of  
the Goodwin children, as told by Cotton Mather; was  
known and read in all the dwellings of the land, and  
filled the imaginations of a credulous age. Deputy Danforth had begun the work of arrests; and  
<pb n="002" id="vII002"/>

<figDesc>Page 002.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
persons charged with witchcraft, belonging to neighboring towns, were already in prison.</p>  
<p>Mr. Parris appears to have had in his family several  
slaves, probably brought by him from the West Indies.  
One of them, whom he calls, in his church-record book,  
&ldquo;my negro lad,&rdquo; had died, a year or two before, at the  
age of nineteen. Two of them were man and wife.  
The former was always known by the name of &ldquo;John  
Indian;&rdquo; the latter was called &ldquo;Tituba.&rdquo; These two  
persons may have originated the &ldquo;Salem witchcraft.&rdquo;  
They are spoken of as having come from New Spain, as  
it was then called, &mdash; that is, the Spanish West Indies,  
and the adjacent mainlands of Central and South America, &mdash; and, in all probability, contributed, from the  
wild and strange superstitions prevalent among their  
native tribes, materials which, added to the commonly  
received notions on such subjects, heightened the infatuation of the times, and inflamed still more the  
imaginations of the credulous. Persons conversant  
with the Indians of Mexico, and on both sides of the  
Isthmus, discern many similarities in their systems of  
demonology with ideas and practices developed here.</p>  
<p>Mr. Parris's former residence in the neighborhood  
of the Spanish Main, and the prominent part taken by  
his Indian slaves in originating the proceedings at the  
village, may account for some of the features of the  
transaction.</p>  
<p>During the winter of 1691 and 1692, a circle of  
young girls had been formed, who were in the habit  
of meeting at Mr. Parris's house for the purpose of  
<pb n="003" id="vII003"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2006">  
<figDesc>Page 003.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
practising palmistry, and other arts of fortune-telling,  
and of becoming experts in the wonders of necromancy,  
magic, and spiritualism. It consisted, besides the  
Indian servants, mainly of the following persons: &mdash;</p>  
<p>Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. Parris, was nine years of  
age. She seems to have performed a leading part in  
the first stages of the affair, and must have been a child  
of remarkable precocity. It is a noticeable fact, that  
her father early removed her from the scene. She  
was sent to the town, where she remained in the family  
of Stephen Sewall, until the proceedings at the village  
were brought to a close. Abigail Williams, a niece of  
Mr. Parris, and a member of his household, was  
eleven years of age. She acted conspicuously in  
the witchcraft prosecutions from beginning to end.  
Ann Putnam, daughter of Sergeant Thomas Putnam,  
the parish clerk or recorder, was twelve years of  
age. The character and social position of her parents  
gave her a prominence which an extraordinary development of the imaginative faculty, and of mental powers  
generally, enabled her to hold throughout. This young  
girl is perhaps entitled to be regarded as, in many  
respects, the leading agent in all the mischief that followed. Mary Walcot was seventeen years of age. Her  
father was Jonathan Walcot (vol. i. p. 225). His first  
wife, Mary Sibley, to whom he was married in 1664,  
had died in 1683. She was the mother of Mary. It is  
a singular fact, and indicates the estimation in which  
Captain Walcot was held, that, although not a church, he filled the office of deacon of the parish  
<pb n="004" id="vII004"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2007">  
<figDesc>Page 004.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
for several years before the formation of the church.  
Mercy Lewis was also seventeen years of age. When  
quite young, she was, for a time, in the family of the  
Rev. George Burroughs: and, in 1692, was living as a  
servant in the family of Thomas Putnam; although,  
occasionally, she seems to have lived, in the same capacity, with that of John Putnam, Jr., the constable of  
the village. He was a son of Nathaniel, and resided  
in the neighborhood of Thomas and Deacon Edward  
Putnam. Mercy Lewis performed a leading part in  
the proceedings, had great energy of purpose and  
capacity of management, and became responsible for  
much of the crime and horror connected with them.  
Elizabeth Hubbard, seventeen years of age, who also  
occupies a bad eminence in the scene, was a niece  
of Mrs. Dr. Griggs, and lived in her family. Elizabeth Booth and Susannah Sheldon, each eighteen  
years of age, belonged to families in the neighborhood.  
Mary Warren, twenty years of age, was a servant in the  
family of John Procter; and Sarah Churchill, of the  
same age, was a servant in that of George Jacobs, Sr.  
These two last were actuated, it is too apparent, by  
malicious feelings towards the families in which they  
resided, and contributed largely to the horrible tragedy.  
The facts to be exhibited will enable every one who  
carefully considers them, to form an estimate, for himself, of the respective character and conduct of these  
young persons. It is almost beyond belief that they  
were wholly actuated by deliberate and cold-blooded  
malignity. Their crime would, in that view, have been  
<pb n="005" id="vII005"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2008">  
<figDesc>Page 005.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
without a parallel in monstrosity of wickedness, and  
beyond what can be imagined of the guiltiest and most  
depraved natures. For myself, I am unable to determine how much may be attributed to credulity,  
hallucination, and the delirium of excitement, or to  
deliberate malice and falsehood. There is too much  
evidence of guile and conspiracy to attribute all their  
actions and declarations to delusion; and their conduct throughout was stamped with a bold assurance  
and audacious bearing. With one or two slight and  
momentary exceptions, there was a total absence of  
compunction or commiseration, and a reckless disregard of the agonies and destruction they were scattering around them. They present a subject that justly  
claims, and will for ever task, the examination of those  
who are most competent to fathom the mysteries of  
the human soul, sound its depths, and measure the  
extent to which it is liable to become wicked and devilish. It will be seen that other persons were drawn  
to act with these &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; as they were  
called, some from contagious delusion, and some, as  
was quite well proved, from a false, mischievous; and  
malignant spirit.</p>  
<p>Besides the above-mentioned persons, there were  
three married women, rather under middle life, who  
acted with the afflicted children, &mdash; Mrs. Ann Putnam,  
the mother of the child of that name; Mrs. Pope; and  
a woman, named Bibber, who appears to have lived at  
Wenham. Another married woman, &mdash; spoken of as  
&ldquo;ancient,&rdquo; &mdash; named Goodell, had also been in the  
<pb n="006" id="vII006"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2009">  
<figDesc>Page 006.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
habit of attending their meetings; but she is not  
named in any of the documents on file, and was  
probably withdrawn, at an early period, from participating in the transaction.</p>  
<p>In the course of the winter, they became quite  
skilful and expert in the arts they were learning, and  
gradually began to display their attainments to the  
admiration and amazement of beholders. At first,  
they made no charges against any person, but confined themselves to strange actions, exclamations, and  
contortions. They would creep into holes, and under  
benches and chairs, put themselves into odd and  
unnatural postures, make wild and antic gestures,  
and utter incoherent and unintelligible sounds. They  
would be seized with spasms, drop insensible to the  
floor, or writhe in agony, suffering dreadful tortures,  
and uttering loud and piercing outcries. The attention of the families in which they held their meetings  
was called to their extraordinary condition and proceedings; and the whole neighborhood and surrounding country soon were filled with the story of the  
strange and unaccountable sufferings of the &ldquo;afflicted  
girls.&rdquo; No explanation could be given, and their  
condition became worse and worse. The physician of  
the village, Dr. Griggs, was called in, a consultation  
had, and the opinion finally and gravely given, that  
the afflicted children were bewitched. It was quite  
common in those days for the faculty to dispose of  
difficult cases by this resort. When their remedies  
were baffled, and their skill at fault, the patient was  
<pb n="007" id="vII007"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2010">  
<figDesc>Page 007.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
said to be &ldquo;under an evil hand.&rdquo; In all cases, the  
sage conclusion was received by nurses, and elderly  
women called in on such occasions, if the symptoms  
were out of the common course, or did not yield to the  
prescriptions these persons were in the habit of applying. Very soon, the whole community became excited  
and alarmed to the highest degree. All other topics  
were forgotten. The only thing spoken or thought of  
was the terrible condition of the afflicted children in  
Mr. Parris's house, or wherever, from time to time, the  
girls assembled. They were the objects of universal  
compassion and wonder. The people flocked from all  
quarters to witness their sufferings, and gaze with  
awe upon their convulsions. Becoming objects of  
such notice, they were stimulated to vary and expand  
the manifestations of the extraordinary influence that  
was upon them. They extended their operations beyond the houses of Mr. Parris, and the families to which  
they belonged, to public places; and their fits, exclamations, and outcries disturbed the exercises of prayer  
meetings, and the ordinary services of the congregation. On one occasion, on the Lord's Day, March 20th,  
when the singing of the psalm previous to the sermon  
was concluded, before the person preaching &mdash; Mr.  
Lawson &mdash; could come forward, Abigail Williams cried  
out, &ldquo;Now stand up, and name your text.&rdquo; When he  
had read it, in a loud and insolent voice she exclaimed, &ldquo;It's a long text.&rdquo; In the midst of the discourse, Mrs. Pope broke in, &ldquo;Now, there is enough of  
that.&rdquo; In the afternoon of the same day, while referring  
<pb n="008" id="vII008"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2011">  
<figDesc>Page 008.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to the doctrine he had been expounding in the  
preceding service, Abigail Williams rudely ejaculated,  
&ldquo;I know no doctrine you had. If you did name  
one, I have forgot it.&rdquo; An aged member of the  
church was present, against whom a warrant on the  
charge of witchcraft had been procured the day before.  
Being apprised of the proceeding, Abigail Williams  
spoke aloud, during the service, calling by name the  
person about to be apprehended, &ldquo;Look where she  
sits upon the beam, sucking her yellow-bird betwixt  
her fingers.&rdquo; Ann Putnam, joining in, exclaimed,  
&ldquo;There is a yellow-bird sitting on the minister's hat,  
as it hangs on the pin in the pulpit.&rdquo; Mr. Lawson  
remarks, with much simplicity, that these things, occurring &ldquo;in the time of public worship, did something  
interrupt me in my first prayer, being so unusual.&rdquo;  
But he braced himself up to the emergency, and went  
on with the service. There is no intimation that Mr.  
Parris rebuked his niece for her disorderly behavior.  
As at several other times, the people sitting near Ann  
Putnam had to lay hold of her to prevent her proceeding to greater extremities, and wholly breaking up the  
meeting. The girls were supposed to be under an  
irresistible and supernatural impulse; and, instead of  
being severely punished, were looked upon with mingled pity, terror, and awe, and made objects of the  
greatest attention. Of course, where members of  
the minister's family were countenanced in such proceedings, during the exercises of public worship, on  
the Lord's Day, in the meeting-house, it was not  
<pb n="009" id="vII009"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2012">  
<figDesc>Page 009.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
strange that people in general yielded to the excitement. But all did not. Several members of the  
family of Francis Nurse, Peter Cloyse and wife, and  
Joseph Putnam, expressed their disapprobation of such  
doings being allowed, and absented themselves from  
meeting. Perhaps others took the same course; but  
whoever did were marked, as the sequel will show.</p>  
<p>In the mean while the excitement was worked up  
to the highest pitch. The families to which several  
of the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; belonged were led to  
apply themselves to fasting and prayer, on which occasions the neighbors, under the guidance of the minister, would assemble, and unite in invocations to the  
Divine Being to interpose and deliver them from the  
snares and dominion of Satan. The &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; who might be present would not, as a general  
thing, interrupt the prayers while in progress, but  
would break out with their wild outcries and convulsive spasms in the intervals of the service. In  
due time, Mr. Parris sent for the neighboring ministers to assemble at his house, and unite with him in  
devoting a day to solemn religious services and earnest  
supplications to the throne of Mercy for rescue from  
the power of the great enemy of souls. The ministers spent the day in Mr. Parris's house, and the children performed their feats before their eyes. The  
reverend gentlemen were astounded at what they  
saw, fully corroborated the opinion of Dr. Griggs, and  
formally declared their belief that the Evil One had  
commenced his operations with a bolder front and  
<pb n="010" id="vII010"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2013">  
<figDesc>Page 010.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
on a broader scale than ever before in this or any other  
country.</p>  
<p>This judgment of the ministers was quickly made  
known everywhere; and, if doubt remained in any  
mind, it was suppressed by the irresistible power of an  
overwhelming public conviction. Individuals were  
lost in the universal fanaticism. Society was dissolved  
into a wild and excited crowd. Men and women left  
their fields, their houses, their labors and employments, to witness the awful unveiling of the demoniac  
power, and to behold the workings of Satan himself  
upon the victims of his wrath.</p>  
<p>It must be borne in mind, that it was then an established doctrine in theology, philosophy, and law, that the  
Devil could not operate upon mortals, or mortal affairs,  
except through the intermediate instrumentality of  
human beings in confederacy with him, that is, witches  
or wizards. The question, of course, in all minds  
and on all tongues, was, &ldquo;Who are the agents of the  
Devil in afflicting these girls? There must be some  
among us thus acting, and who are they?&rdquo; For some  
time the girls held back from mentioning names; or,  
if they did, it was prevented from being divulged to  
the public. In the mean time, the excitement spread  
and deepened. At length the people had become so  
thoroughly prepared for the work, that it was concluded to begin operations in earnest. The continued  
pressure upon the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; the earnest  
and importunate inquiry, on all sides, &ldquo;Who is it that  
bewitches you?&rdquo; opened their lips in response, and  
<pb n="011" id="vII011"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2014">  
<figDesc>Page 011.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
they began to select and bring forward their victims.  
One after another, they cried out &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Osburn,&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Tituba.&rdquo; On the 29th of February, 1692, warrants  
were duly issued against those persons. It is observable, that the complainants who procured the warrants  
in these cases were Joseph Hutchinson, Edward Putnam, Thomas Putnam, and Thomas Preston. This  
fact shows how nearly unanimous, at this time, was the  
conviction that the sufferings of the girls were the  
result of witchcraft. Joseph Hutchinson was a firm man, of strong common sense, and from his  
general character and ways of thinking and acting,  
one of the last persons liable to be carried away by a  
popular enthusiasm, and was found among the earliest  
rescued from it. Thomas Preston was a son-in-law of  
Francis Nurse.</p>  
<p>As all was ripe for the development of the plot,  
extraordinary means were taken to give publicity,  
notoriety, and effect to the first examinations. On the  
1st of March the two leading magistrates of the  
neighborhood, men of great note and influence, whose  
fathers had been among the chief founders of the  
settlement, and who were Assistants, &mdash; that is, members of the highest legislative and judicial body in the  
colony, combining with the functions of a senate those  
of a court of last resort with most comprehensive  
jurisdiction, &mdash; John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin,  
entered the village, in imposing array, escorted by  
the marshal, constables, and their aids, with all the  
trappings of their offices; reined up at Nathaniel Ingersoll  
<pb n="012" id="vII012"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2015">  
<figDesc>Page 012.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
corner, and dismounted at his door. The  
whole population of the neighborhood, apprised of the  
occasion, was gathered on the lawn, or came flocking  
along the roads. The crowd was so great that it was  
necessary to adjourn to the meeting-house, which was  
filled at once by a multitude excited to the highest pitch  
of indignation and abhorrence towards the prisoners,  
and of curiosity to witness the novel and imposing  
spectacle and proceedings. The magistrates took seats  
in front of the pulpit, facing the assembly; a long  
table or raised platform being placed before them;  
and it was announced, that they were ready to enter  
upon the examination. On bringing in and delivering  
over the accused parties, the officers who had executed  
the warrants stated that they &ldquo;had made diligent  
search for images and such like, but could find none.&rdquo;  
After prayer, Constable George Locker produced the  
body of Sarah Good; and Constable Joseph Herrick,  
the bodies of Sarah Osburn, and Tituba Mr. Parris's  
Indian woman. The evidence seems to indicate, that,  
on these occasions, the prisoners were placed on the  
platform, to keep them from the contact of the general  
crowd, and that all might see them.</p>  
<p>Sarah Good was first examined, the other two being  
removed from the house for the time. In complaining  
of her, and bringing her forward first, the prosecutors showed that they were well advised. There was  
a general readiness to receive the charge against her,  
as she was evidently the object of much prejudice in  
the neighborhood. Her husband, who was a weak,  
<pb n="013" id="vII013"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2016">  
<figDesc>Page 013.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
ignorant, and dependent person, had become alienated  
from her. The family were very poor; and she and  
her children had sometimes been without a house to  
shelter them, and left to wander from door to door for  
relief. Whether justly or not, she appears to have  
been subject to general obloquy. Probably there was  
no one in the country around, against whom popular  
suspicion could have been more readily directed, or in  
whose favor and defence less interest could be awakened. She was a forlorn, friendless, and forsaken  
creature, broken down by wretchedness of condition  
and ill-repute. The following are the minutes of her  
examination, as found among the files: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Examination of Sarah Good before the Worshipful  
Esqrs. John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;Sarah Good, what evil spirit have you familiarity  
with? &mdash; None.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Have you made no contracts with the Devil? &mdash; No.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why do you hurt these children? &mdash; I do not hurt them.  
I scorn it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who do you employ then to do it? &mdash; I employ nobody.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What creature do you employ then? &mdash; No creature: but  
I am falsely accused.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go away muttering from Mr. Parris his  
house? &mdash; I did not mutter, but I thanked him for what he  
gave my child.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Have you made no contract with the Devil? &mdash; No.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Hathorne desired the children all of them to look upon  
her, and see if this were the person that hurt them: and so they  
all did look upon her, and said this was one of the persons  
that did torment them. Presently they were all tormented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sarah Good, do you not see now what you have  
done? Why do you not tell us the truth? Why do you  
thus torment these poor children? &mdash; I do not torment  
them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who do you employ then? &mdash; I employ nobody. I  
scorn it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How came they thus tormented? &mdash; What do I know?  
You bring others here, and now you charge me with it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why, who was it? &mdash; I do not know but it was some  
you brought into the meeting-house with you.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;We brought you into the meeting-house. &mdash; But you  
brought in two more.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, then, that tormented the children? &mdash; It  
was Osburn.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What is it you say when you go muttering away from  
persons' houses? &mdash; If I must tell, I will tell.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Do tell us then. &mdash; If I must tell, I will tell: it is the  
Commandments. I may say my Commandments, I hope.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What Commandment is it? &mdash; If I must tell you, I will  
tell: it is a psalm.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What psalm?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(After a long time she muttered over some part of a  
psalm.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who do you serve? &mdash; I serve God.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What God do you serve? &mdash; The God that made heaven  
and earth (though she was not willing to mention the word  
`God'). Her answers were in a very wicked, spiteful manner, reflecting and retorting against the authority with base  
and abusive words; and many lies she was taken in. It was  
here said that her husband had said that he was afraid that  
she either was a witch or would be one very quickly. The  
worshipful Mr. Hathorne, asked him his reason why he

said so of her, whether he had ever seen any thing by her.  
He answered `No, not in this nature; but it was her bad  
carriage to him: and indeed,' said he, `I may say with tears,  
that she is an enemy to all good.&rdquo;'</p></q>  
<p>The foregoing is in the handwriting of Ezekiel Cheever. The following is in that of John Hathorne: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Salem Village, March the 1st, 1692. &mdash; Sarah Good,  
upon examination, denied the matter of fact (viz.) that she  
ever used any witchcraft, or hurt the abovesaid children, or  
any of them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;The abovenamed children, being all present, positively  
accused her of hurting of them sundry times within this  
two months, and also that morning. Sarah Good denied  
that she had been at their houses in said time or near them,  
or had done them any hurt. All the abovesaid children  
then present accused her face to face; upon which they  
were all dreadfully tortured and tormented for a short space  
of time; and, the affliction and tortures being over, they  
charged said Sarah Good again that she had then so tortured them, and came to them and did it, although she was  
personally then kept at a considerable distance from them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Sarah Good being asked if that she did not then hurt  
them, who did it; and the children being again tortured,  
she looked upon them, and said that it was one of them  
we brought into the house with us. We asked her who  
it was: she then answered, and said it was Sarah Osburn,  
and Sarah Osburn was then under custody, and not in  
the house; and the children, being quickly after recovered  
out of their fit, said that it was Sarah Good and also  
Sarah Osburn that then did hurt and torment or afflict  
them, although both of them at the same time at a distance  
<pb n="016" id="vII016"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2019">  
<figDesc>Page 016.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
or remote from them personally. There were also sundry  
other questions put to her, and answers given thereunto by  
her according as is also given in.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It will be noticed that the examination was conducted in the form of questions put by the magistrate,  
Hathorne, based upon a foregone conclusion of the  
prisoner's guilt, and expressive of a conviction, all  
along on his part, that the evidence of &ldquo;the afflicted&rdquo;  
against her amounted to, and was, absolute demonstration. It will also be noticed, that, severe as was the  
opinion of her husband in reference to her general  
conduct, he could not be made to say that he had ever  
noticed any thing in her of the nature of witchcraft.  
The torments the girls affected to experience in looking at her must have produced an overwhelming effect  
on the crowd, as they did on the magistrate, and even  
on the poor, amazed creature herself. She did not  
seem to doubt the reality of their sufferings. In this,  
and in all cases, it must be remembered that the account  
of the examination comes to us from those who were  
under the wildest excitement against the prisoners;  
that no counsel was allowed them; that, if any thing  
was suffered to be said in their defence by others, it  
has failed to reach us; that the accused persons were  
wholly unaccustomed to such scenes and exposures,  
unsuspicious of the perils of a cross-examination, or  
of an inquisition conducted with a design to entrap  
and ensnare; and that what they did say was liable  
to be misunderstood, as well as misrepresented. We  
cannot hear their story. All we know is from parties  
<pb n="017" id="vII017"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2020">  
<figDesc>Page 017.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
prejudiced, to the highest degree, against them. Sarah  
Good was an unfortunate and miserable woman in her  
circumstances and condition: but, from all that appears on the record, making due allowance for the credulity, extravagance, prejudice, folly, or malignity of  
the witnesses; giving full effect to every thing that can  
claim the character of substantial force alleged against  
her, it is undeniable, that there was not, beyond the  
afflicted girls, a particle of evidence to sustain the  
charge on which she was arraigned; and that, in  
the worst aspect of her case, she was an object for  
compassion, rather than punishment. Altogether, the  
proceedings against her, which terminated with her execution, were cruel and shameful to the highest degree.</p>  
<p>On the conclusion of her examination, she was removed from the meeting-house, and Sarah Osburn  
brought in. Her selection, as one of the persons to  
be first cried out upon, was judicious. The public  
mind was prepared to believe the charge against her.  
Her original name was Sarah Warren. She was married, April 5, 1662, to Robert Prince, who belonged to  
a leading family, and owned a valuable farm. He  
died early, leaving her with two young children, James  
and Joseph.</p>  
<p>In the early colonial period, it was the custom for  
persons who desired to come from the old country to  
America, but had not the means to defray the expenses of the passage, to let or sell themselves, for a  
greater or less length of time, to individuals residing  
here who needed their service. The practice continued  
<pb n="018" id="vII018"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2021">  
<figDesc>Page 018.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
down to the present century. Emigrants who thus  
sold themselves for a period of years were called  
&ldquo;redemptioners.&rdquo; Alexander Osburn came over from  
Ireland in this character. The widow of Robert Prince  
bought out the residue of his time from the person to  
whom he was thus under contract, for fifteen pounds,  
and employed him to carry on her farm. After a  
while, she married him. This, it is probable, gave rise  
to some criticism; and, as her boys grew up, became  
more and more disagreeable to them. The marriage,  
as was natural, led to unhappy results. In 1720, after  
Osburn had been dead some years, a curious case was  
brought into court, in which the sons of Robert Prince  
testified that Osburn treated their mother and them  
with great cruelty and barbarity. They had become  
of age before their mother's death, and had signed  
their names to a deed conveying away land belonging  
to their patrimony. The object of the suit was to invalidate the conveyance by proving that they were compelled by Osburn to sign the deed, he using threats  
and violence upon them at the time. There was an  
extraordinary conflict of testimony in the trial; some  
witnesses strongly corroborating the accusations of the  
Princes, and some equally strong in vindication of  
the character of Osburn. It was shown, that, in the  
opinion of several of his neighbors, he was an industrious, respectable, and worthy person. It is difficult  
to determine the precise merits of the case. After the  
death of his wife, Osburn married Ruth, a daughter of  
William Cantlebury, and widow of William Sibley.  
<pb n="019" id="vII019"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2022">  
<figDesc>Page 019.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
She was a woman of unquestioned excellence of character, and of a large landed estate. Osburn was her  
third husband, the first having been Thomas Small.  
After her marriage to Osburn, he and she joined the  
church, and were reputable persons in all respects. He  
was well regarded as a citizen, and often on the parish  
committee. Neither he nor the widow Sibley appear to  
have been implicated in the witchcraft proceedings in  
any other particular than that he testified that his then  
wife Sarah had not been for some time at meeting.  
There is no indication that this was volunteer testimony. He and his wife Ruth were among the firmest  
opponents of Mr. Parris. There is no mention of his  
having had children by either of his American wives.  
His son John, who probably came with him to the  
country, was an inhabitant of the Village; and his  
name is on the rate-list, for the last time, in 1718, his  
father having died some years before. The Osborne  
family, in this part of the country, does not appear to  
have sprung from this source.</p>  
<p>Without attempting to decide where, or in what proportions, the blame is to be laid, the fact is evident, that  
the marriage of the widow Sarah Prince to Alexander  
Osburn was an unhappy one. Her mind became depressed, if not distracted. For some time, she had  
been bedridden. Of course, as she had occupied a  
respectable social position, and was a woman of property, her case naturally gave rise to scandal. Rumor  
was busy and gossip rife in reference to her; and it  
was quite natural that she should have been suggested

for the accusing girls to pitch upon. The following is  
an account of her examination by the magistrates, in  
the handwriting of John Hathorne: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Sarah Osburne, upon examination, denied the matter of  
fact, viz., that she ever understood or used any witchcraft, or  
hurt any of the abovesaid children.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;The children above named, being all personally present,  
accused her face to face; which, being done, they were all  
hurt, afflicted, and tortured very much; which, being over, and  
they out of their fits, they said that said Sarah Osburne did  
then come to them, and hurt them, Sarah Osburne being then  
kept at a distance personally from them. Sarah Osburne  
was asked why she then hurt them. She denied it. It being  
asked of her how she could so pinch and hurt them, and yet  
she be at that distance personally from them, she answered  
she did not then hurt them, nor ever did. She was asked who,  
then, did it, or who she employed to do it. She answered  
she did not know that the Devil goes about in her likeness to  
do any hurt. Sarah Osburne, being told that Sarah Good,  
one of her companions, had, upon examination, accused  
her, she, notwithstanding, denied the same, according to her  
examination, which is more at large given in, as therein will  
appear.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The following is in the handwriting of Ezekiel  
Cheever: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Sarah Osburn her Examination.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;What evil spirit have you familiarity with? &mdash; None.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Have you made no contract with the Devil? &mdash; No: I  
never saw the Devil in my life.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why do you hurt these children? &mdash; I do not hurt them.</p>  
<pb n="021" id="vII021"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2024">  
<figDesc>Page 021.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who do you employ, then, to hurt them? &mdash; I employ  
nobody.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What familiarity have you with Sarah Good? &mdash; None:  
I have not seen her these two years.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see her then? &mdash; One day, agoing to  
town.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What communications had you with her? &mdash; I had none,  
only `How do you do?' or so. I do not know her by name.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did you call her, then?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Osburn made a stand at that; at last, said she called  
her Sarah.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Sarah Good saith that it was you that hurt the children.  
&mdash; I do not know that the Devil goes about in my likeness to  
do any hurt.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hathorne desired all the children to stand up, and  
look upon her, and see if they did know her, which they  
all did; and every one of them said that this was one of the  
women that did afflict them, and that they had constantly  
seen her in the very habit that she was now in. Three evidences declared that she said this morning, that she was  
more like to be bewitched than that she was a witch. Mr.  
Hathorne asked her what made her say so. She answered  
that she was frighted one time in her sleep, and either saw,  
or dreamed that she saw, a thing like an Indian all black,  
which did pinch her in her neck, and pulled her by the back  
part of her head to the door of the house.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did you never see any thing else? &mdash; No.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(It was said by some in the meeting-house, that she had  
said that she would never believe that lying spirit any more.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What lying spirit is this? Hath the Devil ever deceived you, and been false to you? &mdash; I do not know the  
Devil. I never did see him.</p>  
<pb n="022" id="vII022"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2025">  
<figDesc>Page 022.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What lying spirit was it, then? &mdash; It was a voice that I  
thought I heard.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did it propound to you? &mdash; That I should go no  
more to meeting; but I said I would, and did go the next  
sabbath-day.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Were you never tempted further? &mdash; No.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why did you yield thus far to the Devil as never to go to  
meeting since? &mdash; Alas! I have been sick, and not able to go.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Her husband and others said that she had not been at  
meeting three years and two months.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The foregoing illustrates the unfairness practised  
by the examining magistrate. He took for granted,  
as we shall find to have been the case in all instances,  
the guilt of the prisoner, and endeavored to entangle  
her by leading questions, thus involving her in contradiction. By the force of his own assumptions, he  
had compelled Sarah Good to admit the reality of the  
sufferings of the girls, and that they must be caused  
by some one. The amount of what she had said was,  
that, if caused by one or the other of them, &ldquo;then it  
must be Osburn,&rdquo; for she was sure of her own innocence. This expression, to which she was driven in  
self-exculpation, was perverted by the reporter, Ezekiel  
Cheever, and by the magistrate, into an indirect confession and a direct accusation of Osburn. In the  
absence of Good, the magistrate told Osburn that  
Good had confessed and accused her. This was a  
misrepresentation of one, and a false and fraudulent  
trick upon the other. Considering the feeble condition  
of Sarah Osburn generally, the snares by which she

was beset, the distressing and bewildering circumstances in which she was placed, and the infirm state  
of her reason, as evidenced in her statement of what  
she saw, or dreamed that she saw and heard, &mdash; not  
having a clear idea which, &mdash; her answers, as reported  
by the prosecutors, show that her broken and disordered mind was essentially truthful and innocent.</p>  
<p>Sarah Osburn was removed from the meeting-house,  
and Tituba brought in and examined, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Tituba, what evil spirit have you familiarity with? &mdash;  
None.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why do you hurt these children? &mdash; I do not hurt  
them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who is it then? &mdash; The Devil, for aught I know.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did you never see the Devil? &mdash; The Devil came to me,  
and bid me serve him.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who have you seen? &mdash; Four women sometimes hurt  
the children.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who were they? &mdash; Goody Osburn and Sarah Good,  
and I do not know who the others were, Sarah Good and  
Osburn would have me hurt the children, but I would  
not.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(She further saith there was a tall man of Boston that  
she did see.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;When did you see them? &mdash; Last night, at Boston.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did they say to you? &mdash; They said, `Hurt the  
children.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And did you hurt them? &mdash; No: there is four women  
and one man, they hurt the children, and then they lay all  
upon me; and they tell me, if I will not hurt the children,  
they will hurt me.</p>

</p>  
<p>&ldquo;But did you not hurt them? &mdash; Yes; but I will hurt them  
no more.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Are you not sorry that you did hurt them? &mdash; Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And why, then, do you hurt them? &mdash; They say, `Hurt  
children, or we will do worse to you.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What have you seen? &mdash; A man come to me, and say,  
`Serve me.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What service? &mdash; Hurt the children: and last night  
there was an appearance that said, `Kill the children;' and,  
if I would not go on hurting the children, they would do  
worse to me.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What is this appearance you see? &mdash; Sometimes it is  
like a hog, and sometimes like a great dog.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(This appearance she saith she did see four times.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did it say to you? &mdash; The black dog said, `Serve  
me;' but I said, `I am afraid.' He said, if I did not, he  
would do worse to me.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to it? &mdash; I will serve you no longer.  
Then he said he would hurt me; and then he looks like a  
man, and threatens to hurt me. (She said that this man had  
a yellow-bird that kept with him.) And he told me he had  
more pretty things that he would give me, if I would serve  
him.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What were these pretty things? &mdash; He did not show me  
them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What else have you seen? &mdash; Two cats; a red cat, and  
a black cat.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did they say to you? &mdash; They said, `Serve  
me.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;When did you see them? &mdash; Last night; and they said,  
`Serve me;' but I said I would not.</p>

<p>Another report of Tituba's examination has been  
preserved, and may be found in the second volume of  
the collection edited by Samuel G. Drake, entitled the  
&ldquo;Witchcraft Delusion in New England.&rdquo; It is in the  
handwriting of Jonathan Corwin, very full and minute,  
and shows that the Indian woman was familiar with all  
the ridiculous and monstrous fancies then prevalent.  
The details of her statement cover nearly the whole  
ground of them. While indicating, in most respects,  
a mind at the lowest level of general intelligence,  
they give evidence of cunning and wariness in the  
highest degree. This document is also valuable, as  
it affords information about particulars, incidentally  
mentioned and thus rescued from oblivion, which  
<pb n="027" id="vII027"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2030">  
<figDesc>Page 027.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
serve to bring back the life of the past. Tituba describes the dresses of some of the witches: &ldquo;A black  
silk hood, with a white silk hood under it, with topknots.&rdquo; One of them wore &ldquo;a serge coat, with a white  
cap.&rdquo; The Devil appeared &ldquo;in black clothes sometimes, sometimes serge coat of other color.&rdquo; She  
speaks of the &ldquo;lean-to chamber&rdquo; in the parsonage, and  
describes an a&euml;rial night ride &ldquo;up&rdquo; to Thomas Putnam. &ldquo;How did you go? What did you ride  
upon?&rdquo; asked the wondering magistrate. &ldquo;I ride  
upon a stick, or pole, and Good and Osburn behind  
me: we ride taking hold of one another; don't know  
how we go, for I saw no trees nor path, but was presently there when we were up.&rdquo; In both reports, Tituba  
describes, quite graphically, the likenesses in which the  
Devil appeared to his confederates; but Corwin gives  
the details more fully than Cheever. What the latter  
reports of the appearances in which the Devil accompanied Osburn, the former amplifies. &ldquo;The thing with  
two legs and wings, and a face like a woman,&rdquo; &ldquo;turns&rdquo;  
into a full woman. The &ldquo;hairy thing&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;a  
thing all over hairy, all the face hairy, and a long nose,  
and I don't know how to tell how the face looks; is  
about two or three feet high, and goeth upright like a  
man; and, last night, it stood before the fire in Mr.  
Parris's hall.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>It is quite evident that the part played by the Indian  
woman on this occasion was pre-arranged. She had,

show the materials out of which their ridiculous and monstrous stories were constructed. She  
said that there were four who &ldquo;hurt the children.&rdquo;  
Upon being pressed by the magistrate to tell who they  
were, she named Osburn and Good, but did &ldquo;not know  
who the others were.&rdquo; Two others were marked; but  
it was not thought best to bring them out until these  
three examinations had first been made to tell upon  
the public mind. Tituba had been apprised of Elizabeth Hubbard's story, that she had been &ldquo;pinched&rdquo;  
that morning; and, as well as &ldquo;Lieutenant Fuller  
and others,&rdquo; had heard of the delirious exclamation of  
Thomas Putnam's sick child during the night. &ldquo;Abigail Williams, that lives with her uncle Parris,&rdquo;  
had communicated to the Indian slave the story of  
&ldquo;the woman with two legs and wings.&rdquo; In fact, she  
had been fully admitted to their councils, and made  
acquainted with all the stories they were to tell. But,  
when it became necessary to avoid specifications  
touching parties whose names it had been decided not  
to divulge at that stage of the business, the wily old  
servant escapes further interrogation, &ldquo;I am blind  
now: I cannot see.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Proceedings connected with these examinations were  
continued several days. The result appears, in the  
handwriting of John Hathorne, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Salem Village, March 1, 169&frac12;. &mdash; Tituba, an Indian  
woman, brought before us by Constable Jos. Herrick, of  
Salem, upon suspicion of witchcraft by her committed, according to the complaint of Jos. Hutchinson and Thomas

Putnam, &amp;c., of Salem Village, as appears per warrant  
granted, Salem, 29th February, 169&frac12;. Tituba, upon examination, and after some denial, acknowledged the matter  
of fact, as, according to her examination given in, more  
fully will appear, and who also charged Sarah Good and  
Sarah Osburn with the same.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Salem Village, March the 1st, 169&frac12;. &mdash; Sarah Good,  
Sarah Osburn, and Tituba, an Indian woman, all of Salem  
Village, being this day brought before us, upon suspicion of  
witchcraft, &amp;c., by them and every one of them committed;  
Tituba, an Indian woman, acknowledging the matter of  
fact, and Sarah Osburn and Sarah Good denying the same  
before us; but there appearing, in all their examinations,  
sufficient ground to secure them all. And, in order to further examination, they were all <hi rend="italics">per mittimus</hi> sent to the jails  
in the county of Essex.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Salem, March 2. &mdash; Sarah Osburn again examined,  
and also Tituba, as will appear in their examinations given  
in. Tituba again acknowledged the fact, and also accused  
the other two.</p>

again examined. The examination now given in. Tituba  
again said the same.</p>

the same she did formerly, and accused the other two above  
said.</p>

</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Salem, March the 7th, 169&frac12;. &mdash; Sarah Good, Sarah  
Osburn, and Tituba, an Indian woman, all sent to the jail  
in Boston, according to their <hi rend="italics">mittimuses,</hi> then sent to their  
Majesties' jail-keeper.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It will be noticed that the magistrates did not venture to put into this their final record, what they had  
unfairly tried to make Sarah Osborn believe, that Sarah  
Good had been a witness against her. The jail at Ipswich was at a distance of at least ten miles from the  
village meeting-house, by any road that could then have  
been travelled. The transferrence of the prisoners  
day after day must have been very fatiguing to a sick  
woman like Sarah Osburn. Sarah Good seems to  
have been able to bear it. Samuel Braybrook, an assistant constable, having charge of her, says, that, on the  
way to Ipswich, she &ldquo;leaped off her horse three times;&rdquo;  
that she &ldquo;railed against the magistrates, and endeavored to kill herself.&rdquo; He further testified, that, at the  
very time she was performing these feats, Thomas Putnam daughter, &ldquo;at her father's house, declared the  
same.&rdquo; As Braybrook was many miles from Thomas  
Putnam's house, at the moment when his wonderful  
daughter exercised this miraculous extent of vision, it  
would have been more satisfactory to have had some  
other testimony to the fact. I mention this to show of  
what stuff the evidence in these cases was made, and  
the credulity with which every thing was swallowed.  
The prisoners were put to examination each day.</p>  
<p>Osburn and Good steadily maintained their innocence. Tituba all along declared herself guilty, and  
<pb n="031" id="vII031"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2034">  
<figDesc>Page 031.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
accused the other two of having been with her in confederacy with the Devil. Mr. Parris made the following deposition, in relation to these examinations, to  
which he subsequently swore in Court, at the trial of  
Sarah Good: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Sam: Parris,</hi> aged about thirty  
and nine years. &mdash; Testifieth and saith, that Elizabeth Parris, Jr., and Abigail Williams, and Ann Putnam, Jr.,  
and Elizabeth Hubbard, were most grievously and several  
times tortured during the examination of Sarah Good, Sarah  
Osburn, and Tituba, Indian, before the magistrates at Salem  
Village, 1 March, 1692. And the said Tituba being the last  
of the above said that was examined, they, the above said  
afflicted persons, were grievously distressed until the said  
Indian began to confess, and then they were immediately  
all quiet the rest of the said Indian woman's examination.  
Also Thomas Putnam, aged about forty years, and Ezekiel  
Cheever, aged about thirty and six years, testify to the whole  
of the above said; and all the three deponents aforesaid  
further testify, that, after the said Indian began to confess,  
she was herself very much afflicted, and in the face of  
authority at the same time, and openly charged the above Good and Osburn as the persons that afflicted her, the  
aforesaid Indian.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>By comparing these depositions with the other documents I have presented, it will be seen how admirably  
the whole affair was arranged, so far as concerned the  
part played by Tituba. She commences her testimony  
by declaring her innocence. The afflicted children  
are instantly thrown into torments, which, however,  
<pb n="032" id="vII032"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2035">  
<figDesc>Page 032.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
subside as soon as she begins to confess. Immediately  
after commencing her confession, and as she proceeds  
in it, she herself becomes tormented &ldquo;in the face of  
authority,&rdquo; before the eyes of the magistrates and the  
awestruck crowd. Her power to afflict ceases as she  
breaks loose from her compact with the Devil, who  
sends some unseen confederate, not then brought  
to light, to weak his vengeance upon her for having  
confessed. Tituba, as well as the girls, showed herself an adept in the arts taught in the circle.</p>  
<p>All we know of Sarah Osburn beyond this date are  
the following items in the Boston jailer's bill &ldquo;against  
the country,&rdquo; dated May 29, 1692: &ldquo;To chains for  
Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn, 14 shillings:&rdquo; &ldquo;To  
the keeping of Sarah Osburn, from the 7th of March  
to the 10th of May, when she died, being nine weeks  
and two days, &pound;1. 3<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 5<hi rend="italics">d.</hi>&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The only further information we have of Tituba is  
from Calef, who says, &ldquo;The account she since gives  
of it is, that her master did beat her, and otherwise  
abuse her, to make her confess and accuse (such as  
he called) her sister-witches; and that whatsoever she  
said by way of confessing or accusing others was the  
effect of such usage: her master refused to pay her fees,  
unless she would stand to what she had said. Calef  
further states that she laid in jail until finally &ldquo;sold for  
her fees.&rdquo; The jailer's charge for her &ldquo;diet in prison  
for a year and a month&rdquo; appears in a shape that corroborates Calef's statements, which were prepared for  
publication in 1697, and printed in London in 1700.  
<pb n="033" id="vII033"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2036">  
<figDesc>Page 033.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Although zealously devoted to the work of exposing  
the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, there is no ground to dispute the veracity of  
Calef as to matters of fact. What he says of the declarations of Tituba, subsequent to her examination, is  
quite consistent with a critical analysis of the details  
of the record of that examination. It can hardly be  
doubted, whatever the amount of severity employed to  
make her act the part assigned her, that she was used  
as an instrument to give effect to the delusion.</p>  
<p>Now let us consider the state of things that had  
been brought about in the village, and in the surrounding country, at the close of the first week in  
March, 1692. The terrible sufferings of the girls in  
Mr. Parris's family and of their associates, for the  
two preceding months, had become known far and  
wide. A universal sympathy was awakened in their  
behalf; and a sentiment of horrow sunk deep into all  
hearts, at the dread demonstration of the diabolical  
rage in their afflicted and tortured persons. A few,  
very few, distrusted; but the great majority, ninetynine in a hundred of all the people, were completely  
swept into the torrent. Nathaniel Putnam and Nathaniel Ingersoll were entirely deluded, and continued so  
to the end. Even Joseph Hutchinson was, for a while,  
carried away. The physicians had all given their  
opinion that the girls were suffering from an &ldquo;evil  
hand.&rdquo; The neighboring ministers, after a day's fasting and prayer, and a scrutinizing inspection of the  
condition of the afflicted children, had given it, as  
<pb n="034" id="vII034"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2037">  
<figDesc>Page 034.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the result of their most solemn judgment, that it was  
a case of witchcraft. Persons from the neighboring  
towns had come to the place, and with their own eyes  
received demonstration of the same fact. Mr. Parris  
made it the topic of his public prayers and preaching.  
The girls, Sunday after Sunday, were under the malign  
influence, to the disturbance and affrightment of the  
congregation. In all companies, in all families, all  
the day long, the sufferings and distraction occurring  
in the houses of Mr. Parris, Thomas Putnam, and  
others, and in the meeting-house, were topics of excited conversation; and every voice was loud in demanding, every mind earnest to ascertain, who were  
the persons, in confederacy with the Devil, thus torturing, pinching, convulsing, and bringing to the last  
extremities of mortal agony, these afflicted girls.  
Every one felt, that, if the guilty authors of the mischief could not be discovered, and put out of the way,  
no one was safe for a moment. At length, when the  
girls cried out upon Good, Osburn, and Tituba, there  
was a general sense of satisfaction and relief. It was  
thought that Satan's power might be checked. The selection of the first victims was well made. They were  
just the kind of persons whom the public prejudice  
and credulity were prepared to suspect and condemn.  
Their examination was looked for with the utmost interest, and all flocked to witness the proceedings.</p>  
<p>In considering the state of mind of the people,  
as they crowded into and around the old meeting, we can have no difficulty in realizing the  
<pb n="035" id="vII035"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2038">  
<figDesc>Page 035.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
tremendous effects of what there occurred. It was  
felt that then, on that spot, the most momentous crisis  
in the world's history had come. A crime, in comparison with which all other crimes sink out of notice,  
was being notoriously and defiantly committed in their  
midst. The great enemy of God and man was let  
loose among them. What had filled the hearts of  
mankind for ages, the world over, with dread apprehension, was come to pass; and in that village the  
great battle, on whose issue the preservation of the  
kingdom of the Lord on the earth was suspended, had  
begun. Indeed, no language, no imagery, no conception of ours, can adequately express the feeling of  
awful and terrible solemnity with which all were overwhelmed. No body of men ever convened in a more  
highly wrought state of excitement than pervaded that  
assembly, when the magistrates entered, in all their  
stern authority, and the scene opened on the 1st of  
March, 1692. A minister, probably Mr. Parris, began,  
according to the custom of the times, with prayer.  
From what we know of his skill and talent in meeting such occasions, it may well be supposed that his  
language and manner heightened still more the passions of the hour. The marshal, of tall and imposing  
stature and aspect, accompanied by his constables,  
brought in the prisoners. Sarah Good, a povertystricken, wandering, and wretched victim of ill-fortune  
and ill-usage, was put to the bar. Every effort was  
made by the examining magistrate, aided by the officious interference of the marshal, or other deluded or  
<pb n="036" id="vII036"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2039">  
<figDesc>Page 036.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
evil-disposed persons, &mdash; who, like him, were permitted  
to interpose with charges or abusive expressions, &mdash; to  
overawe and confound, involve in contradictions, and  
mislead the poor creature, and force her to confess  
herself guilty and accuse others. In due time, the  
&ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; were brought in; and a scene 
ensued, such as no person in that crowd or in that  
generation had ever witnessed before. Immediately  
on being confronted with the prisoner, and meeting  
her eye, they fell, as if struck dead, to the floor; or  
screeched in agony; or went into fearful spasms or  
convulsive fits; or cried out that they were pricked with  
pins, pinched, or throttled by invisible hands. They  
were severally brought up to the prisoner, and, upon  
touching her person, instantly became calm, quiet,  
and fully restored to their senses. With one voice  
they all declared that Sarah Good had thus tormented  
them, by her power as a witch in league with the  
Devil. The truth of this charge, in the effect produced by the malign influence proceeding from her,  
was thus visible to all eyes. All saw, too, how instantly upon touching her the diabolical effect ceased;  
the malignant fluid passing back, like an electric stream,  
into the body of the witch. The spectacle was repeated once and again, the acting perfect, and the delusion consummated. The magistrates and all present  
considered the guilt of the prisoner demonstrated, and  
regarded her as wilfully and wickedly obstinate in not  
at once confessing what her eyes, as well as theirs,  
saw. Her refusal to confess was considered as the  
<pb n="037" id="vII037"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2040">  
<figDesc>Page 037.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
highest proof of her guilt. They passed judgment  
against her, committed her to the marshal, who hurried  
her to prison, bound her with cords, and loaded her  
with irons; for it was thought that no ordinary fastenings could hold a witch. Similar proceedings, with  
suitable variations, were had with Sarah Osburn and  
Tituba. The confession of the last-named, the immediate relief thereafter of the afflicted children, and the  
dreadful torments which Tituba herself experienced,  
on the spot, from the unseen hand of the Devil  
wreaking vengeance upon her, put the finishing touch  
to the delusion. The excitement was kept up, and  
spread far and wide, by the officers and magistrates  
riding in cavalcade, day after day, to and from the  
town and village; and by the constables, with their  
assistants, carrying their manacled prisoners from  
jail to jail in Ipswich, Salem, and Boston.</p>  
<p>The point was now reached when the accusers could  
safely strike at higher game. But time was taken to  
mature arrangements. Great curiosity was felt to  
know who the other two were whom Tituba saw in connection with Good and Osburn in their hellish operations. The girls continued to suffer torments and fall  
in fits, and were constantly urged by large numbers of  
people, going from house to house to witness their sufferings, to reveal who the witches were that still afflicted  
them. When all was prepared, they began to cry out,  
with more or less distinctness; at first, in significant  
but general descriptions, and at last calling names.  
The next victim was also well chosen. An account  
<pb n="038" id="vII038"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2041">  
<figDesc>Page 038.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
has been given, in the First Part, of the notoriety  
which circumstances had attached to Giles Corey.  
In 1691 he became a member of the church, being  
then (Vol. I. p. 182) eighty years of age. Four  
daughters, all probably by his first wife Margaret, the  
only children of whom there is any mention, were  
married to John Moulton, John Parker, and Henry  
Crosby, of Salem, and William Cleaves, of Beverly.  
On the 11th of April, 1664, Corey was married to  
Mary Britt, who died, as appears by the inscription on  
her gravestone in the old Salem burial-ground, Aug.  
27, 1684. Martha was his third wife. Her age  
is unknown. It was entered on the record of the  
village church, at the time of her admission to it,  
April 27, 1690; but the figures are worn away from  
the edge of the page. She was a very intelligent and  
devout person.</p>  
<p>When the proceedings relating to witchcraft began,  
she did not approve of them, and expressed her want  
of faith in the &ldquo;afflicted children.&rdquo; She discountenanced the whole affair, and would not follow the  
multitude to the examinations; but was said to have  
spoken freely of the course of the magistrates, saying  
that their eyes were blinded, and that she could  
open them. It seemed to her clear that they were  
violating common sense and the Word of God, and  
she was confident that she could convince them of  
their errors. Instead of falling into the delusion,  
she applied herself with renewed earnestness to keep  
her own mind under the influence of prayer, and  
<pb n="039" id="vII039"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2042">  
<figDesc>Page 039.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
spent more time in devotion than ever before. Her  
husband, however, was completely carried away by  
the prevalent fanaticism, believed all he heard, and  
frequented the examinations and the exhibitions of  
the afflicted children. This disagreement became  
quite serious. Her preferring to stay at home, shunning the proceedings, and expressing her disapprobation of what was going on, caused an estrangement  
between them. Her peculiar course created comment, in which he and two of his sons-in-law took  
part. Some strong expressions were used by him,  
because she acted so strangely at variance with everybody else. Her spending so much time on her knees  
in devotion was looked upon as a matter of suspicion.  
It was said that she tried to prevent him from following up the examinations, and went so far as to remove  
the saddle from the horse brought up to convey him  
to some meeting at the village connected with the  
witchcraft excitement. Angry words, uttered by him,  
were heard and repeated. As she was a woman of  
notable piety, a professor of religion, and a member  
of the church, it was evident that her case, if she were  
proceeded against, would still more heighten the panic,  
and convulse the public mind. It would give ground  
for an idea which the managers of the affair desired  
to circulate, that the Devil had succeeded in making  
inroads into the very heart of the church, and was  
bringing into confederacy with him aged and eminent  
church-members, who, under color of their profession,  
threatened to extend his influence to the overthrow of  
<pb n="040" id="vII040"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2043">  
<figDesc>Page 040.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
all religion. It was, indeed, established in the popular  
 
sentiments, as a sign and mark of the Devil's coming,  
that many professing godliness would join his standard.</p>  
<p>For a day or two, it was whispered round that persons in great repute for piety were in the diabolical  
confederacy, and about to be unmasked. The name  
of Martha Corey, whose open opposition to the proceedings had become known, was passed among the  
girls in an under-breath, and caught from one to another among those managing the affair. On the 12th  
of March, Edward Putnam and Ezekiel Cheever, having  
heard Ann Putnam declare that Goody Corey did  
often appear to her, and torture her by pinching and  
otherwise, thought it their duty to go to her, and see  
what she would say to this complaint; &ldquo;she being in  
church covenant with us.&rdquo; They mounted their horses about &ldquo;the middle of the afternoon,&rdquo; and first went  
to the house of Thomas Putnam to see his daughter  
Ann, to learn from her what clothes Goody Corey appeared to her in, in order to judge whether she might  
not have been mistaken in the person. The girl told  
them, that Goody Corey, knowing that they contemplated making this visit, had just appeared in spirit  
to her, but had blinded her so that she could not  
tell what clothes she wore. Highly wrought upon by  
the extraordinary statement of the girl, which they  
received with perfect credulity, the two brethren remounted, and pursued their way. Goody Corey had  
heard that her name had been bandied about by the  
accusing girls: she also knew that it was one of their  
<pb n="041" id="vII041"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2044">  
<figDesc>Page 041.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
arts to pretend to see the clothes people were wearing  
at the time their spectres appeared to them. This  
required, indeed, no great amount of necromancy; as  
it is not probable that there was much variety in the  
costume of farmer's wives, at that time, while about  
their ordinary domestic engagements.</p>  
<p>They found her alone in her house. As soon as  
they commenced conversation, &ldquo;in a smiling manner  
she said, `I know what you are come for; you are come  
to talk with me about being a witch, but I am none:  
I cannot help people's talking of me.&rdquo;' Edward Putnam acknowledged that their visit was in consequence  
of complaints made against her by the afflicted children. She inquired whether they had undertaken to  
describe the clothes she then wore. They answered  
that they had not, and proceeded to repeat what Ann  
Putnam had said to them about her blinding her so  
that she could not see her clothes. At this she smiled,  
no doubt at Ann's cunning artifice to escape having to  
say what dress she then had on. She declared to the  
two brethren, that &ldquo;she did not think that there were  
any witches.&rdquo; After considerable talk, in which they  
did not get much to further their purpose, they took  
their leave. The account of this interview, given by  
Putnam and Cheever, indicates that Martha Corey  
was a sensible, enlightened, and sprightly woman, perfectly free from the delusion of the day, courteous in  
her manners and bearing, and a Christian, well  
grounded in Scripture.</p>  
<p>The two brethren returned forthwith to Thomas  
<pb n="042" id="vII042"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2045">  
<figDesc>Page 042.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Putnam's house. Ann told them that Goody Corey  
had not troubled her, nor her spectre appeared, in  
their absence. She was not inclined to afford them  
an opportunity to apply the test of the dress. Both  
the women showed great acuteness and caution. As  
Corey expected the visit, and had heard that the girls  
pretended to be able to say what dress persons were  
wearing, she probably had attired herself in an unusual way on the occasion, to put them at fault, and  
expose the falseness of their claims to preternatural  
knowledge; and Ann Putnam &mdash; her sagacity suggesting the risk she was running in the matter of Corey's  
dress &mdash; took refuge in the pretence of blindness. The  
brethren were too much under delusion to see through  
the sharp practice of both of them, but considered the  
fact of Corey's inquiring of them whether Ann described her dress, as, under the circumstances, proof  
positive against the former.</p>  
<p>Wishing to make assurance doubly sure, and to  
fasten the charge upon Martha Corey, the managers of  
the affair sent for her to come to the house of Thomas  
Putnam two days after this conference. Edward Putnam was present, and testified that his niece Ann,  
immediately upon the entrance of Goodwife Corey,  
experienced the most dreadful convulsions and tortures and distinctly and positively declared that Corey  
was the author of her sufferings. This was regarded  
as conclusive evidence; and, on the 19th of March, a  
warrant was issued for her arrest. She was brought  
to the house of Nathaniel Ingersoll, on Monday the  
<pb n="043" id="vII043"/>

<figDesc>Page 043.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
21st; and the following is the account of her examination, in the handwriting of Mr. Parris. The proceedings took place in the meeting-house at the village.  
They were introduced by a prayer from the Rev.  
Nicholas Noyes. On some of these occasions Mr.  
Hale and perhaps others, but usually Mr. Noyes or  
Mr. Parris officiated. We may suppose, from what  
we know of their general deportment in connection  
with these scenes, that their performances, under the  
cover of a devotional exercise, expressed and enforced  
a decided prejudgment of the case in hand against  
the prisoners, and partook of the character of indictments as much as of prayers.</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Examination of Martha Corey.</hi></p>

<p>&ldquo;Salem Village, March the 21st, 1692. &mdash; The Reverend Mr. Samuel Parris, being desired to take, in writing,  
the examination of Martha Corey, hath returned it, as aforesaid.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Upon hearing the aforesaid, and seeing what we did  
then see, together with the charges of the persons then present,  
<pb n="050" id="vII050"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2053">  
<figDesc>Page 050.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
we committed Martha Corey, the wife of Giles Corey,  
of Salem Farms, unto the gaol in Salem, as <hi rend="italics">per mittimus</hi>  
then given out.</p></q>  
<p>The foregoing is a full copy of the original document. One of Giles Corey's daughters, Deliverance,  
had married, June 5, 1683, Henry Crosby, who lived  
on land conveyed to him by her father in the immediate neighborhood. He was the person whose written  
testimony was read by the magistrate. Its purport  
seems to have been to prove that Martha Corey had said  
that the accusing girls could not stand before her, and  
that the Devil could not stand before her. She had,  
undoubtedly, great confidence in her own innocence,  
and in the power of truth and prayer, to silence false  
accusers, and expressed herself in the forcible language  
which Parris's report of the examination shows that  
she was well able to use. It is almost amusing to see  
how the pride of the magistrates was touched, and  
their wrath kindled, by what she was reported to have  
said, &ldquo;that the magistrates' and ministers' eyes were  
blinded, and that she would open them.&rdquo; It rankled  
in Hathorne's breast: he returns to it again and  
again, and works himself up to a higher degree of  
resentment on each recurrence. Mr. Noyes's ire was  
<pb n="051" id="vII051"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2054">  
<figDesc>Page 051.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
roused, and he, too, put in a stroke. It will be noticed,  
that she avoided a contradiction of her husband, and  
could not be brought to give the names of persons from  
whom she had received information. &ldquo;If you will all  
go hang me, how can I help it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye are all against  
me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What can I do, when many rise up against  
me?&rdquo; &ldquo;When all are against me, what can I [say  
to] help it?&rdquo; Situated as she was, all that she could  
do was to give them no advantage, or opportunity to  
ensnare her, and to avoid compromising others; and  
it must be allowed that she showed much presence  
and firmness of mind. Her request, made at the  
opening of the examination, and at &ldquo;sundry times,&rdquo;  
to &ldquo;go to prayer,&rdquo; somewhat confounded them. She  
probably was led to make and urge the request particularly in consequence of the tenor of Mr. Noyes's  
prayer at the opening. She felt that it was no more  
than fair that there should be a prayer on her side, as  
well as on the other. It might well be feared, that, if  
allowed to offer a prayer, coming from a person in her  
situation, an aged professor, and one accustomed to express herself in devotional exercises, it might produce  
a deep impression upon the whole assembly. To refuse such a request had a hard look; but, as the magistrates saw, it never would have done to have permitted  
it. It would have reversed the position of all concerned. The latter part of the examination has the  
appearance that she was suspected to be unsound on a  
particular article of the prevalent creed. It is much  
to be regretted that the abrasion of the paper at the  
<pb n="052" id="vII052"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2055">  
<figDesc>Page 052.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
folding has obliterated her last answer to this part of  
the inquisition. It is singular that Mr. Parris has left  
the blank in her final answer. Probably she used her  
customary expression, &ldquo;I am a gospel woman.&rdquo; The  
writing, at this point, is very clear and distinct; and a  
vacant space is left, just as it is given above.</p>  
<p>The fact that Martha Corey was known to be an  
eminently religious person, and very much given to  
acts of devotion, constituted a serious obstacle, no  
doubt, in the way of the prosecutors. Parris's record  
of the examination shows how they managed to get  
over it. They gave the impression that her frequent  
and long prayers were addressed to the Devil.</p>  
<p>The disagreement between her and her husband,  
touching the witchcraft prosecutions, brought him into  
a very uncomfortable predicament. With his characteristic imprudence of speech, he had probably expressed himself strongly against her unbelief in the  
sufferings of the girls and her refusal to attend  
the exhibitions of their tortures, or the examination  
of persons accused. He was, unquestionably, highly  
shocked and incensed at her open repudiation of the  
whole doctrine of witchcraft. Although he had become, in his old age, a professor and a fervently religious man, perhaps he fell back, in his resentment of  
her course, into his life-long rough phrases, and said  
that she acted as though the Devil was in her. He  
might have said that she prayed like a witch. Being  
entirely carried away by the delusion, he had his own  
marvellous stories to tell about his cattle's being bewitched,  
<pb n="053" id="vII053"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2056">  
<figDesc>Page 053.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
&amp;c. His talk, undoubtedly, came to the  
ears of the prosecutors; and they seem to have taken  
steps to induce him to come forward as a witness  
against her. The following document is among the  
papers: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The evidence of Giles Corey testifieth and saith, that  
last Saturday, in the evening, sitting by the fire, my wife  
asked me to go to bed. I told her I would go to prayer;  
and, when I went to prayer, I could not utter my desires  
with any sense, nor open my mouth to speak.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;My wife did perceive it, and came towards me, and said  
she was coming to me.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;After this, in a little space, I did, according to my  
measure, attend the duty.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Some time last week, I fetched an ox, well, out of the  
woods about noon: and, he laying down in the yard, I went  
to raise him to yoke him; but he could not rise, but dragged  
his hinder parts, as if he had been hip-shot. But after did  
rise.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;I had a cat sometimes last week strangely taken on the  
sudden, and did make me think she would have died presently. My wife bid me knock her in the head, but I did  
not; and since, she is well.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Another time, going to duties, I was interrupted for a  
space; but afterward I was helped according to my poor  
measure. My wife hath been wont to sit up after I went to  
bed; and I have perceived her to kneel down on the hearth,  
as if she were at prayer, but heard nothing.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">At the examination of Sarah</hi> Good and others, my  
wife was willing</p>  
<p>&ldquo;March 24, 1692.&rdquo;</p></q>

</p>  
<p>The foregoing document does not express the idea  
that he thought his wife was a witch. He states what  
he observed, and what happened to him and to his  
cattle. He evidently supposed they were bewitched,  
and that he was obstructed, in going to prayer, in a  
strange manner; but he does not, in terms, charge it  
upon her. It gives an interesting insight of the innermost domestic life of the period, in a farmhouse, and  
exhibits striking touches of the character and ways of  
these two old people. It illustrates the state of the  
imagination prevailing among those who were carried  
away by the delusion. If an ox had a sprained muscle,  
or a cat a fit of indigestion, it was thought to be the  
work of an evil hand. Poor old Giles had come late to  
a religious life, and, it is to be feared, was a novice in  
prayer. It is no wonder that he was not an adept in  
&ldquo;uttering his desires,&rdquo; and experienced occasionally  
some difficulty in arranging and expressing his devotional sentiments.</p>  
<p>There is something very singular in the appearance  
of the foregoing deposition. Purporting to be a piece  
of testimony, it was not given in the usual and regular way. It does not indicate before whom it was  
made. It is not attested in the ordinary manner;  
apparently, was not sworn to in the presence of persons authorized to act in such cases; was never offered  
in court or anywhere. It is a disconnected paper  
found among the remnants of the miscellaneous collection in the clerk's office, and is evidently an unfinished document; the words in Italics, at the close,  
being erased by a line running through them.</p>  
<pb n="055" id="vII055"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2058">

</figure>  
</p>  
<p>It is probable that the parties who tried to get the  
old man to testify against his wife discovered that  
they could not draw any thing from him to answer  
their designs, but that there was danger that his evidence would be favorable to her, and gave up the attempt to use him on the occasion. The fact that he  
would not lend himself to their purposes perhaps led  
to resentment on their part, which may explain the  
subsequent proceedings against him.</p>  
<p>The document, in its chirography, suggests the idea  
that it was written by Mr. Noyes, which is not improbable, as Corey was a member of his congregation and  
church. Noyes was deeply implicated in the prosecutions, and violent in driving them on. The handwriting of the original papers reveals the agency of  
those who were the most busy in procuring evidence  
against persons accused. That of Thomas Putnam  
occurs in very many instances. But Mr. Parris was,  
beyond all others, the busiest and most active prosecutor. The depositions of the child Abigail Williams,  
his niece and a member of his family, were written by  
him, as also a great number of others. He took down  
most of the examinations, put in a deposition of his  
own whenever he could, and was always ready to indorse those of others.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that, when Tituba was put  
through her examination, she said &ldquo;four women  
sometimes hurt the children.&rdquo; She named Good and  
Osburn, but pretended to have been blinded as to  
the others. Martha Corey was, in due time, as we  
<pb n="056" id="vII056"/>

have seen, brought out. The fourth was the venerable  
head of a large and prominent family, and a member  
of the mother-church in Salem. She had never transferred her relations to the village church, with which,  
however, she had generally worshipped, and probably  
communed. Being one of the chief matrons of the  
place, she was seated in the meeting-house with ladies  
of similar age and standing, occupying the same bench  
or compartment with the widow of Thomas Putnam,  
Sr. The women were seated separately from the  
men; and the only rule applied among them was eminence in years and respectability.</p>  
<p>It has always been considered strange and unaccountable, that a person of such acknowledged worth  
as Rebecca Nurse, of infirm health and advanced  
years, should have been selected among the early victims of the witchcraft prosecutions. Jealousies and  
prejudices, such as often infest rural neighborhoods,  
may have been engendered, in minds open to such  
influences, by the prosperity and growing influence of  
her family. It may be that animosities kindled by the  
long and violent land controversy, with which many  
parties had been incidentally connected, lingered in  
some breasts. There are decided indications, that the  
passions awakened by the angry contest between the  
village and &ldquo;Topsfield men,&rdquo; and which the collisions  
of a half-century had all along exasperated and hardened, may have been concentrated against the Nurses.  
Isaac Easty, whose wife was a sister of Rebecca Nurse,  
and the Townes, who were her brothers or near kinsmen,  
<pb n="057" id="vII057"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2060">  
<figDesc>Page 057.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
were the leaders of the Topsfield men. It is a  
significant circumstance, in this connection, that to  
one of the most vehement resolutions passed at meetings of the inhabitants of the village, against the  
claims of Topsfield, Samuel Nurse, her eldest son,  
and Thomas Preston, her eldest son-in-law, entered  
their protest on the record; and, on another similar  
occasion, her husband Francis Nurse, her son Samuel,  
and two of her sons-in-law, Preston and Tarbell, took  
the same course. So far as the family sided with  
Topsfield in that controversy, it naturally exposed  
them to the ill-will of the people of the village. An  
analysis of the names and residences of the persons  
proceeded against, throughout the prosecutions, will  
show to what an extent hostile motives were supplied  
from this quarter. The families of Wildes, How,  
Hobbs, Towne, Easty, and others who were &ldquo;cried  
out&rdquo; upon by the afflicted children, occupied lands  
claimed by parties adverse to the village. What,  
more than all these causes, was sufficient to create a  
feeling against the Nurses, is the fact that they were  
opposed to the party which had existed from the beginning in the parish composed originally of the friends  
of Bayley. To crown the whole, when the excitement  
occasioned by the extraordinary doings in Mr. Parris's  
family began to display itself, and the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; were brought into notice, the members of this  
family, with the exception, for a time, of Thomas Preston, discountenanced the whole thing. They absented  
themselves from meeting, on account of the disturbances

and disorders the girls were allowed to make  
during the services of worship, in the congregation,  
on the Lord's Day. Unfriendly remarks, from whatever cause, made in the hearing of the girls, provided  
subjects for them to act upon. Some persons behind  
them, suggesting names in this way, whether carelessly or with malicious intent, were guilty of all the  
misery that was created and blood that was shed.</p>  
<p>It became a topic of rumor, that Rebecca Nurse was  
soon to be brought out. It reached the ears of her  
friends, and the following document comes in at this  
point: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;We whose names are underwritten being desired to go  
to Goodman Nurse his house, to speak with his wife, and to  
tell her that several of the afflicted persons mentioned her;  
and accordingly we went, and we found her in a weak and  
low condition in body as she told us, and had been sick  
almost a week. And we asked how it was otherwise with  
her: and she said she blessed God for it, she had more of  
his presence in this sickness than sometime she have had, but  
not so much as she desired; but she would, with the apostle,  
press forward to the mark; and many other places of Scripture to the like purpose. And then, of her own accord, she  
began to speak of the affliction that was amongst them, and  
in particular of Mr. Parris his family, and how she was  
grieved for them, though she had not been to see them, by  
reason of fits that she formerly used to have; for people  
said it was awful to behold: but she pitied them with all  
her heart, and went to God for them. But she said she  
heard that there was persons spoke of that were as innocent  
as she was, she believed; and, after much to this purpose,  
<pb n="059" id="vII059"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2062">  
<figDesc>Page 059.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
we told her we heard that she was spoken of also. `Well,' she  
said, `if it be so, the will of the Lord be done:' she sat still  
a while, being as it were amazed; and then she said, `Well,  
as to this thing I am as innocent as the child unborn; but  
surely,' she said, `what sin hath God found out in me unrepented of, that he should lay such an affliction upon me in  
my old age?' and, according to our best observation, we  
could not discern that she knew what we came for before  
we told her. <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel Porter,</hi></p>

are ready to testify on oath. <hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel Andrew,</hi></p>

<p>Elizabeth Porter, who joins her husband in making  
this statement, was a sister of John Hathorne, the  
examining magistrate, and the mother-in-law of Joseph  
Putnam, who was among the very few that condemned  
the proceedings from the first. She stood, therefore,  
between the two parties. The character of each of  
the signers and indorsers of this interesting paper  
is sufficient proof that its statements are truthful. It  
cannot but excite the most affecting sensibilities in  
every breast. This venerable lady, whose conversation and bearing were so truly saint-like, was an invalid of extremely delicate condition and appearance,  
the mother of a large family, embracing sons, daughters, grandchildren, and one or more great. She was a woman of piety, and simplicity  
of heart. In all probability, she shared in the  
popular belief on the subject of witchcraft, and supposed  
<pb n="060" id="vII060"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2063">  
<figDesc>Page 060.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that the sufferings of the children were real,  
and that they were afflicted by an &ldquo;evil hand.&rdquo; At the  
very time that she was sorrowfully sympathizing with  
them and Mr. Parris's family, and praying for them,  
they were circulating suspicions against her, and  
maturing their plans for her destruction.</p>  
<p>Rebecca Nurse was a daughter of William Towne,  
of Yarmouth, Norfolk County, England, where she  
was baptized, Feb. 21, 1621. Her sister Mary, who  
married Isaac Easty, was baptized at the same place,  
Aug. 24, 1634. The records of the First Church at  
Salem, Sept. 3, 1648, give the baptism of &ldquo;Joseph and  
Sarah, children of Sister Towne.&rdquo; Sarah was at that  
time seven years of age. She became the wife of  
Edmund Bridges, and afterwards of Peter Cloyse.</p>  
<p>On the 23d of March, a warrant was issued, on complaint of Edward Putnam, and Jonathan, son of John  
Putnam, for the arrest of &ldquo;Rebecca, wife of Francis Nurse;&rdquo; and the next morning, at eight o'clock,  
she was brought to the house of Nathaniel Ingersoll, in the custody of George Herrick, the marshal of  
Essex. There were several distinct indictments, four  
of which, for having practised &ldquo;certain detestable arts  
called witchcraft&rdquo; upon Ann Putnam, Mary Walcot,  
Elizabeth Hubbard, and Abigail Williams, are preserved. The examination took place forthwith at the  
meeting-house. The age, character, connections, and  
appearance of the prisoner, made the occasion one of  
the extremest interest. Hathorne, the magistrate, began the proceedings by addressing one of the afflicted:  
<pb n="061" id="vII061"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2064">  
<figDesc>Page 061.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
&ldquo;What do you say? Have you seen this woman hurt  
you?&rdquo; The answer was, &ldquo;Yes, she beat me this  
morning.&rdquo; Hathorne, addressing another of the afflicted, said, &ldquo;Abigail, have you been hurt by this  
woman?&rdquo; Abigail answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; At that point,  
Ann Putnam fell into a grievous fit, and, while in  
her spasms, cried out that it was Rebecca Nurse who  
was thus afflicting her. As soon as Ann's fit was over,  
and order restored, Hathorne said, &ldquo;Goody Nurse,  
here are two, Ann Putnam the child, and Abigail  
Williams, complain of your hurting them. What do  
you say to it?&rdquo; The prisoner replied, &ldquo;I can say,  
before my eternal Father, I am innocent, and God will  
clear my innocency.&rdquo; Hathorne, apparently touched  
for the moment by her language and bearing, said,  
&ldquo;Here is never a one in the assembly but desires it;  
but, if you be guilty, pray God discover you.&rdquo; Henry  
Kenney rose up from the body of the assembly to  
speak. Hathorne permitted the interruption, and said,  
&ldquo;Goodman Kenney, what do you say?&rdquo; Then Kenney complained of the prisoner, &ldquo;and further said,  
since this Nurse came into the house, he was seized  
twice with an amazed condition.&rdquo; Hathorne, addressing the prisoner, said, &ldquo;Not only these, but the wife of  
Mr. Thomas Putnam, accuseth you by credible information, and that both of tempting her to iniquity and  
of greatly hurting her.&rdquo; The prisoner again affirmed  
her innocence, and said, in answer to the charge of  
having hurt these persons, that &ldquo;she had not been  
able to get out of doors these eight or nine days.&rdquo;  
<pb n="062" id="vII062"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2065">  
<figDesc>Page 062.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Hathorne then called upon Edward Putnam, who, as  
the record says, &ldquo;gave in his relate,&rdquo; which undoubtedly was a statement of his having seen the afflicted  
in their sufferings, and heard them accuse Rebecca  
Nurse as their tormentor. Hathorne said, &ldquo;Is this  
true, Goody Nurse?&rdquo; She denied that she had ever  
hurt them or any one else in her life. Hathorne  
repeated, &ldquo;You see these accuse you: is it true?&rdquo;  
She answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He again put the question,  
&ldquo;Are you an innocent person relating to this witchcraft?&rdquo; It seems, from his manner, that he was beginning really to doubt whether she might not be  
innocent; and perhaps the feeling of the multitude  
was yielding in her favor.</p>  
<p>Here Thomas Putnam's wife cried out, &ldquo;Did you not  
bring the black man with you? Did you not bid me  
tempt God, and die? How oft have you eat and  
drank your own damnation?&rdquo; This sudden outbreak,  
from such a source, accompanied with the wild and  
apparently supernatural energy and uncontrollable vehemence with which the words were uttered, roused  
the multitude to the utmost pitch of horror; and the  
prisoner seems to have been shocked at the dreadful  
exhibition of madness in the woman and in the assembly. Releasing her hands from confinement, she spread  
them out towards heaven, and exclaimed, &ldquo;O Lord,  
help me!&rdquo; Instantly, the whole company of the  
afflicted children &ldquo;were grievously vexed.&rdquo; After a  
while, the tumult subsided, and Hathorne again addressed her, &ldquo;Do you not see what a solemn condition  
<pb n="063" id="vII063"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2066">  
<figDesc>Page 063.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
these are in? When your hands are loosed, the persons are afflicted.&rdquo; Then Mary Walcot and Elizabeth  
Hubbard came forward, and accused her. Hathorne  
again addressed her, &ldquo;Here are these two grown persons now accuse. What say you? Do not you see these  
afflicted persons, and hear them accuse you?&rdquo; She  
answered, &ldquo;The Lord knows I have not hurt them.  
I am an innocent person.&rdquo; Hathorne continued, &ldquo;It  
is very awful to all to see these agonies, and you, an  
old professor, thus charged with contracting with the  
Devil by the effects of it, and yet to see you stand with  
dry eyes where there are so many wet.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;You do not know my heart.&rdquo; Hathorne,  
&ldquo;You would do well, if you are guilty, to confess, and  
give glory to God.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I am as clear as the child  
unborn.&rdquo; Hathorne continued, &ldquo;What uncertainty  
there may be in apparitions, I know not: yet this with  
me strikes hard upon you, that you are, at this very  
present, charged with familiar spirits, &mdash; this is your  
bodily person they speak to; they say now they see  
these familiar spirits come to your bodily person.  
Now, what do you say to that?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I have none,  
sir.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;If you have, confess, and give glory to God.  
I pray God clear you, if you be innocent, and, if you  
are guilty, discover you; and therefore give me an  
upright answer. Have you any familiarity with these  
spirits?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;No: I have none but with God alone.&rdquo;  
It looks as if again the magistrate began to open  
his mind to a fair view of the case. He seems to  
have sought satisfaction in reference to all the charges  
<pb n="064" id="vII064"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2067">  
<figDesc>Page 064.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that had been made against her. She was suffering  
from infirmities of body, the result not only of age, but  
of the burdens of life often pressing down the physical  
frame, particularly of those who have borne large families of children. The magistrate had heard some  
malignant gossip of this kind, and he asked, &ldquo;How  
came you sick? for there is an odd discourse of that in  
the mouths of many.&rdquo; She replied that she suffered  
from weakness of stomach. He inquired, more specifially, &ldquo;Have you no wounds?&rdquo; Her answer was,  
that her ailments and weaknesses, all her bodily infirmities, were the natural effects of what she had experienced in a long life. &ldquo;I have none but old age.&rdquo; &mdash;  
&ldquo;You do know whether you are guilty, and have  
familiarity with the Devil; and now, when you are  
here present, to see such a thing as these testify, &mdash; a  
black man whispering in your ear, and birds about  
you, &mdash; what do you say to it?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;It is all false: I  
am clear.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Possibly, you may apprehend you are  
no witch; but have you not been led aside by temptations that way?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I have not.&rdquo; At this point, it  
almost seems that Hathorne was yielding to the moral  
effect of the evidence she bore in her deportment and  
language, the impress of conscious innocence in her  
countenance, and the manifestation of true Christian  
purity and integrity in her whole manner and bearing.  
Instead of pressing her with further interrogatories,  
he gave way to an expression, in the form of a soliloquy or ejaculation, &ldquo;What a sad thing is it, that a  
church-member here, and now another of Salem,  
<pb n="065" id="vII065"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2068">  
<figDesc>Page 065.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
should thus be accused and charged!&rdquo; Upon hearing this rather ambiguous expression of the magistrate, Mrs. Pope fell into a grievous fit.</p>  
<p>Mrs. Pope was the wife of Joseph Pope, living with  
his mother, the widow Gertrude Pope, on the farm  
shown on the map. She had followed up the meetings of the circle, been a constant witness of the  
sufferings of the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; and attended  
all the public examinations, until her nervous system was excited beyond restraint, and for a while  
she went into fits and her imagination was bewildered. She acted with the accusers, and participated  
in their sufferings. On some occasions, her conduct  
was wild and extravagant to the highest degree. At  
the examination of Martha Corey, she was conspicuous  
for the violence of her actions. In the midst of the  
proceedings, and in the presence of the magistrates  
and hundreds of people, she threw her muff at the  
prisoner; and, that missing, pulled off her shoe, and,  
more successful this time, hit her square on the head.  
Hers seems, however, to have been a case of mere  
delusion, amounting to temporary insanity. That it  
was not deliberate and cold-blooded imposture is rendered probable by the fact, that she was rescued from  
the hallucination, and, with her husband, among the  
foremost to deplore and denounce the whole affair.  
But, when a woman of her position acted in this manner, on such an occasion, and then went into convulsions, and the whole company of afflicted persons  
joined in, the confusion, tumult, and frightfulness of  
<pb n="066" id="vII066"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2069">  
<figDesc>Page 066.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the scene can hardly be imagined, certainly it cannot  
be described in words.</p>  
<p>Quiet being restored, Hathorne proceeded: &ldquo;Tell  
us, have you not had visible appearances, more than  
what is common in nature?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I have none, nor  
never had in my life.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Do you think these suffer  
voluntary or involuntary?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I cannot tell.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;That  
is strange: every one can judge.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I must be silent.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;They accuse you of hurting them; and, if  
you think it is not unwillingly, but by design, you  
must look upon them as murderers.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I cannot tell  
what to think of it.&rdquo; This answer was considered as  
very aspersive in its bearing upon the witnesses, and  
she was charged with having called them murderers.  
Being hard of hearing, she did not always take in the  
whole import of questions put to her. She denied  
that she said she thought them murderers; all she  
said, and that she stood to to the last, was that  
she could not tell what to make of their conduct.  
Finally, Hathorne put this question, and called for an  
answer, &ldquo;Do you think these suffer against their wills  
or not?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I do not think these suffer  
against their wills.&rdquo; To this point she was not afraid  
or unwilling to go, in giving an opinion of the conduct of the accusing girls. Infirm, half deaf, crossquestioned, circumvented, surrounded with folly, uproar, and outrage, as she was, they could not intimidate  
her to say less, or entrap her to say more.</p>  
<p>Then another line of criminating questions was  
started by the magistrate: &ldquo;Why did you never visit  
<pb n="067" id="vII067"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2070">  
<figDesc>Page 067.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
these afflicted persons?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Because I was afraid I  
should have fits too.&rdquo; On every motion of her body,  
&ldquo;fits followed upon the complainants, abundantly and  
very frequently.&rdquo; As soon as order was again restored, Hathorne, being, as he always was, wholly convinced of the reality of the sufferings of the &ldquo;afflicted  
children,&rdquo; addressed her thus, &ldquo;Is it not an unaccountable case, that, when you are examined, these  
persons are afflicted?&rdquo; Seeing that he and the whole  
assembly put faith in the accusers, her only reply was,  
&ldquo;I have got nobody to look to but God.&rdquo; As she  
uttered these words, she naturally attempted to raise  
her hands, whereupon &ldquo;the afflicted persons were  
seized with violent fits of torture.&rdquo; After silence was  
again restored, the magistrate pressed his questions  
still closer. &ldquo;Do you believe these afflicted persons  
are bewitched?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I do think they  
are.&rdquo; It will be noticed that there was this difference  
between Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey: The latter  
was an utter heretic on the point of the popular faith  
respecting witchcraft; she did not believe that there  
were any witches, and she looked upon the declarations and actions of the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; as the  
ravings of &ldquo;distracted persons.&rdquo; The former seems to  
have held the opinions of the day, and had no disbelief in witchcraft: she was willing to admit that the  
children were bewitched; but she knew her own innocence, and nothing could move her from the consciousness of it. Mr. Hathorne continued, &ldquo;When this  
witchcraft came upon the stage, there was no suspicion  
<pb n="068" id="vII068"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2071">  
<figDesc>Page 068.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of Tituba, Mr. Parris's Indian woman. She professed  
much love to that child, &mdash; Betty Parris; but it was her  
apparition did the mischief: and why should not you  
also be guilty, for your apparition doth hurt also?&rdquo;  
Her answer was, &ldquo;Would you have me belie myself?&rdquo;  
Weary, probably, of the protracted proceedings, her  
head drooped on one side; and forthwith the necks of  
the afflicted children were bent in the same way. This  
new demonstration of the diabolical power that proceeded from her filled the house with increased awe,  
and spread horrible conviction of her guilt through all  
minds. Elizabeth Hubbard's neck was fixed in that  
direction, and could not be moved. Abigail Williams  
cried out, &ldquo;Set up Goody Nurse's head, the maid's  
neck will be broke.&rdquo; Whereupon, some persons held  
the prisoner's head up, and &ldquo;Aaron Way observed that  
Betty Hubbard's was immediately righted.&rdquo; To consummate the effect of the whole proceeding, Mr. Parris, by direction of the magistrates, &ldquo;read what he  
had in characters taken from Mr. Thomas Putnam's  
wife in her fits.&rdquo; We shall come to the matter thus  
introduced by Mr. Parris, at a future stage of the story.  
It is sufficient here to say, that it contained the most  
positive and minute declarations that the apparition of  
Rebecca Nurse had appeared to her, on several occasions, and horribly tortured her. After hearing Parris's  
statement, Hathorne asked the prisoner, &ldquo;What do you  
think of this?&rdquo; Her reply was, &ldquo;I cannot help it:  
the Devil may appear in my shape.&rdquo; It may be mentioned, that Mrs. Ann Putnam was present during this  
<pb n="069" id="vII069"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2072">  
<figDesc>Page 069.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
examination, and, in the course of it, went into the  
most dreadful bodily agony, charging it on Rebecca  
Nurse. Her sufferings were so violent, and held on so  
long, that the magistrates gave permission to her husband to carry her out of the meeting-house, to free her  
from the malignant presence of the prisoner. The  
record of the examination closes thus: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Salem Village, March 24th, 169&frac12;. &mdash; The Reverend Mr.  
Samuel Parris, being desired to take in writing the examination of Rebecca Nurse, hath returned it as aforesaid.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Upon hearing the aforesaid, and seeing what we then did  
see, together with the charges of the persons then present,  
we committed Rebecca Nurse, the wife of Francis Nurse  
of Salem Village, unto Her Majesty's jail in Salem, as <hi rend="italics">per  
mittimus</hi> then given out, in order to further examination.</p></q>  
<p>The presence of Ann Putnam, the mother, on this  
occasion; the statement from her, read by Mr. Parris;  
and the terrible sufferings she exhibited, produced, no  
doubt, a deep effect upon the magistrates and all  
present. Her social position and personal appearance  
undoubtedly contributed to heighten it. For two  
months, her house had been the constant scene of the  
extraordinary actings of the circle of girls of which her  
daughter and maid-servant were the leading spirits.  
<pb n="070" id="vII070"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2073">  
<figDesc>Page 070.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Her mind had been absorbed in the mysteries of  
spiritualism. The marvels of necromancy and magic  
had been kept perpetually before it. She had been  
living in the invisible world, with a constant sense  
of supernaturalism surrounding her. Unconsciously,  
perhaps, the passions, prejudices, irritations, and animosities, to which she had been subject, became mixed  
with the vagaries of an excited imagination; and, laid  
open to the inroads of delusion as her mind had long  
been by perpetual tamperings with spiritual ideas and  
phantoms, she may have lost the balance of reason and  
sanity. This, added to a morbid sensibility, probably  
gave a deep intensity to her voice, action, and countenance. The effect upon the excited multitude must  
have been very great. Although she lived to realize  
the utter falseness of all her statements, her monstrous  
fictions were felt by her, at the time, to be a reality.</p>  
<p>In concluding his report of this examination, Mr.  
Parris says, &ldquo;By reason of great noises by the  
afflicted and many speakers, many things are pretermitted.&rdquo; He was probably quite willing to avoid  
telling the whole story of the disgraceful and shocking scenes enacted in the meeting-house that day.  
Deodat Lawson was present during the earlier part of  
the proceedings. He says that Mr. Hale began with  
prayer; that the prisoner &ldquo;pleaded her innocency  
with earnestness;&rdquo; that, at the opening, some of the  
girls, Mary Walcot among them, declared that the prisoner had never hurt them. Presently, however, Mary  
Walcot screamed out that she was bitten, and charged  
<pb n="071" id="vII071"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2074">  
<figDesc>Page 071.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
it upon Rebecca Nurse. The marks of teeth were  
produced on her wrist. Lawson says, &ldquo;It was so disposed that I had not leisure to attend the whole time  
of examination.&rdquo; The meaning is, I suppose, that he  
desired to withdraw into the neighboring fields to con  
over his manuscript, and make himself more able to  
perform with effect the part he was to act that afternoon. &ldquo;There was once,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;such an hideous  
screech and noise (which I heard as I walked at a little  
distance from the meeting-house) as did amaze me;  
and some that were within told me the whole assembly was struck with consternation, and they were afraid  
that those that sat next to them were under the influence of witchcraft.&rdquo; The whole congregation was in  
an uproar, every one afflicted by and affrighting every  
other, amid a universal outcry of terror and horror.</p>  
<p>As it was a part of the policy of the managers of  
the business to utterly overwhelm the influence of all  
natural sentiment in the community, they coupled  
with this proceeding against a venerable and infirm  
great-grandmother, another of the same kind against  
a little child. Immediately after the examination of  
Rebecca Nurse was concluded, Dorcas, a daughter of  
Sarah Good, was brought before the magistrates. She  
was between four and five years old. Lawson says,  
&ldquo;The child looked hale and well as other children.&rdquo;  
A warrant had been issued for her apprehension, the  
day before, on complaint of Edward and Jonathan  
Putnam. Herrick the marshal, who was a man that  
magnified his office, and of much personal pride, did  
<pb n="072" id="vII072"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2075">  
<figDesc>Page 072.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
not, perhaps, fancy the idea of bringing up such a  
little prisoner; and he deputized the operation to  
Samuel Braybrook, who, the next morning, made return, in due form, that &ldquo;he had taken the body of  
Dorcas Good,&rdquo; and sent her to the house of Nathaniel  
Ingersoll, where she was in custody. It seems that  
Braybrook did not like the job, and passed the handling of the child over to still another. Whoever performed the service probably brought her in his arms,  
or on a pillion. The little thing could not have  
walked the distance from Benjamin Putnam's farm.  
When led in to be examined, Ann Putnam, Mary Walcot, and Mercy Lewis, all charged her with biting,  
pinching, and almost choking them. The two former  
went through their usual evolutions in the presence of  
the awe and terror stricken magistrates and multitude.  
They showed the marks of her little teeth on their  
arms; and the pins with which she pricked them were  
found on their bodies, precisely where, in their shrieks,  
they had averred that she was piercing them. The  
evidence was considered overwhelming; and Dorcas  
was, <hi rend="italics">per mittimus,</hi> committed to the jail, where she  
joined her mother. By the bill of the Boston jailer,  
it appears that they both were confined there: as they  
were too poor to provide for themselves, &ldquo;the country&rdquo;  
was charged with ten shillings for &ldquo;two blankets for  
Sarah Good's child.&rdquo; The mother, we know, was  
kept in chains; the child was probably chained too.  
Extraordinary fastenings, as has been stated, were  
thought necessary to hold a witch.</p>  
<pb n="073" id="vII073"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2076">  
<figDesc>Page 073.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>There was no longer any doubt, in the mass of the  
community, that the Devil had effected a lodgement at  
Salem Village. Church-members, persons of all social  
positions, of the highest repute and profession of piety,  
eminent for visible manifestations of devotion, and  
of every age, had joined his standard, and become  
his active allies and confederates.</p>  
<p>The effect of these two examinations was unquestionably very great in spreading consternation and  
bewilderment far and wide; but they were only the  
prelude to the work, to that end, arranged for the day.  
The public mind was worked to red heat, and now was  
the moment to strike the blow that would fix an impression deep and irremovable upon it. It was Thursday, Lecture-day; and the public services usual on the  
occasion were to be held at the meeting-house.</p>  
<p>Deodat Lawson had arrived at the village on the  
19th of March, and lodged at Deacon Ingersoll's. The  
fact at once became known; and Mary Walcot immediately went to the deacon's to see him. She had a fit  
on the spot, which filled Lawson with amazement and  
horror. His turn of mind led him to be interested in  
such an excitement; and he had become additionally  
and specially exercised by learning that the afflicted  
persons had intimated that the deaths of his wife and  
daughter, which occurred during his ministry at the  
village, had been brought about by the diabolical  
agency of the persons then beginning to be unmasked,  
and brought to justice. He was prepared to listen to  
the hints thus thrown out, and was ready to push  
<pb n="074" id="vII074"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2077">  
<figDesc>Page 074.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the prosecutions on with an earnestness in which  
 
resentment and rage were mingled with the blindest  
credulity. After Mary Walcot had given him a specimen of what the girls were suffering, he walked over,  
early in the evening, to Mr. Parris's house; and there  
Abigail Williams went into the craziest manifestations,  
throwing firebrands about the house in the presence  
of her uncle, rushing to the back of the chimney as  
though she would fly up through its wide flue, and performing many wonderful works. The next day being  
Sunday, he preached; and the services were interrupted, in the manner already described, by the outbreaks of the afflicted, under diabolic influence. The  
next day, he attended the examination of Martha  
Corey. On Wednesday, the 23d, he went up to  
Thomas Putnam's, as he says, &ldquo;on purpose to see his  
wife.&rdquo; He &ldquo;found her lying on the bed, having had a  
sore fit a little before: her husband and she both  
desired me to pray with her while she was sensible,  
which I did, though the apparition said I should not go  
to prayer. At the first beginning, she attended; but,  
after a little time, was taken with a fit, yet continued  
silent, and seemed to be asleep.&rdquo; She had represented  
herself as being in conflict with the shape, or spectre,  
of a witch, which, she told Lawson, said he should not  
pray on the occasion. But he courageously ventured  
on the work. At the conclusion of the prayer, &ldquo;her  
husband, going to her, found her in a fit. He took her  
off the bed to sit her on his knees; but at first she  
was so stiff she could not be bended, but she afterwards  
<pb n="075" id="vII075"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2078">  
<figDesc>Page 075.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
sat down.&rdquo; Then she went into that state of  
supernatural vision and exaltation in which she was  
accustomed to utter the wildest strains, in fervid, extravagant, but solemn and melancholy, rhapsodies: she  
disputed with the spectre about a text of Scripture,  
and then poured forth the most terrible denunciations  
upon it for tormenting and tempting her. She was  
evidently a very intellectual and imaginative woman,  
and was perfectly versed in all the imagery and lofty  
diction supplied by the prophetic and poetic parts of  
Scripture. Again she was seized with a terrible fit,  
that lasted &ldquo;near half an hour.&rdquo; At times, her mouth  
was drawn on one side and her body strained. At  
last she broke forth, and succeeded, after many violent  
struggles against the spectre and many convulsions of  
her frame, in saying what part of the Bible Lawson  
was to read aloud, in order to relieve her. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo;  
she said, &ldquo;the third chapter of the Revelation.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I  
did,&rdquo; says Lawson, &ldquo;something scruple the reading  
it.&rdquo; He was loath to be engaged in an affair of that  
kind in which the Devil was an actor. At length he  
overcame his scruples, and the effect was decisive.  
&ldquo;Before I had near read through the first verse, she  
opened her eyes, and was well.&rdquo; Bewildered and  
amazed, he went back to Parris's house, and they  
talked over the awful manifestations of Satan's power.  
The next morning, he attended the examination of  
Rebecca Nurse, retiring from it, at an early hour,  
to complete his preparation for the service that had  
been arranged for him that afternoon.</p>  
<pb n="076" id="vII076"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2079">  
<figDesc>Page 076.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>I say arranged, because the facts in this case prove  
long-concerted arrangement. He was to preach a  
sermon that day. Word must have been sent to him  
weeks before. After reaching the village, every hour  
had been occupied in exciting spectacles and engrossing experiences, filling his mind with the fanatical enthusiasm requisite to give force and fire to the delivery  
of the discourse. He could not possibly have written  
it after coming to the place. He must have brought  
it in his pocket. It is a thoroughly elaborated and  
carefully constructed performance, requiring long and  
patient application to compose it, and exhausting all  
the resources of theological research and reference,  
and of artistic skill and finish. It is adapted to the  
details of an occasion which was prepared to meet  
it. Not only the sermon but the audience were the  
result of arrangement carefully made in the stages of  
preparation and in the elements comprised in it.  
The preceding steps had all been seasonably and  
appositely taken, so that, when the regular lecture  
afternoon came, Lawson would have his voluminous  
discourse ready, and a congregation be in waiting to  
hear it, with minds suitably wrought upon by the  
preceding incidents of the day, to be thoroughly and  
permanently impressed by it. The occasion had been  
heralded by a train of circumstances drawing everybody to the spot. The magistrates were already there,  
some of them by virtue of the necessity of official  
presence in the earlier part of the day, and others came  
in from the neighborhood; the ministers gathered from  
<pb n="077" id="vII077"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2080">  
<figDesc>Page 077.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the towns in the vicinity; men and women came from  
all quarters, flocking along the highways and the by, large numbers on horseback, and crowds on  
foot. Probably the village meeting-house, and the  
grounds around it, presented a spectacle such as never  
was exhibited elsewhere. Awe, dread, earnestness, a  
stern but wild fanaticism, were stamped on all countenances, and stirred the heaving multitude to its  
depths, and in all its movements and utterances. It  
is impossible to imagine a combination of circumstances that could give greater advantage and power  
to a speaker, and Lawson was equal to the situation.  
No discourse was ever more equal, or better adapted,  
to its occasion. It was irresistible in its power, and  
carried the public mind as by storm.</p>  
<p>The text is Zechariah, iii. 2: &ldquo;And the Lord said  
unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan! even the  
Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not  
this a brand plucked out of the fire?&rdquo; After an  
allusion to the rebellion of Satan, and his fall from  
heaven with his &ldquo;accursed legions,&rdquo; and after representing them as filled &ldquo;with envy and malice against  
all mankind,&rdquo; seeking &ldquo;by all ways and means to  
work their ruin and destruction for ever, opposing  
to the utmost all persons and things appointed by the  
Lord Jesus Christ as means or instruments of their  
comfort here or salvation hereafter,&rdquo; he proceeds, in  
the manner of those days, to open his text and spread  
out his subject, all along exhibiting great ability, skill,  
and power, showing learning in his illustrations, drawing  
<pb n="078" id="vII078"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2081">  
<figDesc>Page 078.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
aptly and abundantly from the Scriptures, and,  
at the right points, rising to high strains of eloquence  
in diction and imagery.</p>  
<p>He describes, at great length and with abundant  
instances ingeniously selected from sacred and profane literature, the marvellous power with which Satan  
is enabled to operate upon mankind. He says, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;He is a spirit, and hence strikes at the spiritual part,  
the most excellent (constituent) part of man. Primarily  
disturbing and interrupting the animal and vital spirits, he  
maliciously operates upon the more common powers of the  
soul by strange and frightful representations to the fancy  
or imagination; and, by violent tortures of the body, often  
threatening to extinguish life, as hath been observed in  
those that are afflicted amongst us. And not only so,  
but he vents his malice in diabolical operations on the more  
sublime and distinguishing faculties of the rational soul,  
raising mists of darkness and ignorance in the understanding.... Sometimes he brings distress upon the bodies of  
men, by malignant operations in, and diabolical impressions  
on, the spirituous principle or vehicle of life and motion....  
There are certainly some lower operations of Satan (whereof there are sundry examples among us), which the bodies  
and souls of men and women are liable unto. And whosoever hath carefully observed those things must needs be  
convinced, that the motions of the persons afflicted, both as  
to the manner and as to the violence of them, are the mere  
effects of diabolical malice and operations, and that it cannot rationally be imagined to proceed from any other cause  
whatever.... Satan exerts his malice mediately by employing some of mankind and other creatures, and he frequently  
<pb n="079" id="vII079"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2082">  
<figDesc>Page 079.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
useth other persons or things, that his designs may be the  
more undiscernible. Thus he used the serpent in the first  
temptation (Gen. iii. 1). Hence he contracts and indents  
with witches and wizards, that they shall be the instruments  
by whom he may more secretly affect and afflict the bodies  
and minds of others; and, if he can prevail upon those that  
make a visible profession, it may be the better covert unto  
his diabolical enterprise, and may the more readily pervert  
others to consenting unto his subjection. So far as we can  
look into those hellish mysteries, and guess at the administration of that kingdom of darkness, we may learn that  
witches make witches by persuading one the other to subscribe to a book or articles, &amp;c.; and the Devil, having them  
in his subjection, by their consent, he will use their bodies  
and minds, shapes and representations, to affright and afflict  
others at his pleasure, for the propagation of his infernal  
kingdom, and accomplishing his devised mischiefs to the  
souls, bodies, and lives of the children of men, yea, and  
of the children of God too, so far as permitted and is  
possible.... He insinuates into the society of the adopted  
children of God, in their most solemn approaches to him,  
in sacred ordinances, endeavoring to look so like the true  
saints and ministers of Christ, that, if it were possible, he  
would deceive the very elect (Matt. xxiv. 24) by his subtilty: for it is certain he never works more like the Prince  
of darkness than when he looks most like an angel of light;  
and, when he most pretends to holiness, he then doth most  
secretly, and by consequence most surely, undermine it, and  
those that most excel in the exercise thereof.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The following is a specimen of the style in which  
he stirred up the people: &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="080" id="vII080"/>

<q><p>&ldquo;The application of this doctrine to ourselves remains  
now to be attended. Let it be for solemn warning and  
awakening to all of us that are before the Lord at this time,  
and to all others of this whole people, who shall come to  
the knowledge of these direful operations of Satan, which  
the holy God hath permitted in the midst of us.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;The Lord doth terrible things amongst us, by lengthening the chain of the roaring lion in an extraordinary manner, so that the Devil is come down in great wrath (Rev.  
xii. 12), endeavoring to set up his kingdom, and, by racking  
torments on the bodies, and affrightening representations  
to the minds of many amongst us, to force and fright them  
to become his subjects. I may well say, then, in the words of  
the prophet (Mic. vi. 9), `The Lord's voice crieth to the city,'  
and to the country also, with an unusual and amazing loudness. Surely, it warns us to awaken out of all sleep, of  
security or stupidity, to arise, and take our Bibles, turn to,  
and learn that lesson, not by rote only, but by heart. 1 Pet.  
v. 8: `Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the  
Devil goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom amongst  
you he may distress, delude, and devour.'... Awake, awake  
then, I beseech you, and remain no longer under the dominion of that prince of cruelty and malice, whose tyrannical  
fury we see thus exerted against the bodies and minds of  
these afflicted persons!... This warning is directed to all  
manner of persons, according to their condition of life, both  
in civil and sacred order; both high and low, rich and poor,  
old and young, bond and free. Oh, let the observation of  
these amazing dispensations of God's unusual and strange  
Providence quicken us to our duty, at such a time as this,  
in our respective places and stations, relations and capacities!  
The great God hath done such things amongst us as do  
<pb n="081" id="vII081"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2084">  
<figDesc>Page 081.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
make the ears of those that hear them to tingle (Jer. xix. 3);  
and serious souls are at a loss to what these things may  
grow, and what we shall find to be the end of this dreadful  
visitation, in the permission whereof the provoked God as  
a lion hath roared, who can but fear? the Lord hath  
spoken, who can but prophesy? (Amos iii. 8.) The loud  
trumpet of God, in this thundering providence, is blown in  
the city, and the echo of it heard through the country, surely  
then the people must and ought to be afraid (Amos iii. 6).  
... You are therefore to be deeply humbled, and sit in the  
dust, considering the signal hand of God in singling out  
this place, this poor village, for the first seat of Satan's  
tyranny, and to make it (as 'twere the rendezvous of devils,  
where they muster their internal forces; appearing to the  
afflicted as coming armed to carry on their malicious designs against the bodies, and, if God in mercy prevent not,  
against the souls, of many in this place.... Be humbled  
also that so many members of this church of the Lord Jesus  
Christ should be under the influences of Satan's malice in  
these his operations; some as the objects of his tyranny  
on their bodies to that degree of distress which none can  
be sensible of but those that see and feel it, who are in the  
mean time also sorely distressed in their minds by frightful  
representations made by the devils unto them. Other professors and visible members of this church are under the  
awful accusations and imputations of being the instruments  
of Satan in his mischievous actings. It cannot but be  
matter of deep humiliation, to such as are innocent, that  
the righteous and holy God should permit them to be named  
in such pernicious and unheard-of practices, and not only  
so, but that he who cannot but do right should suffer the  
stain of suspected guilt to be, as it were, rubbed on and  
<pb n="082" id="vII082"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2085">  
<figDesc>Page 082.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
soaked in by many sore and amazing circumstances. And  
it is a matter of soul-abasement to all that are in the bond  
of God's holy covenant in this place, that Satan's seat should  
be amongst them, where he attempts to set up his kingdom  
in opposition to Christ's kingdom, and to take some of the  
visible subjects of our Lord Jesus, and use at least their  
shapes and appearances, instrumentally, to afflict and torture  
other visible subjects of the same kingdom. Surely his design is that Christ's kingdom may be divided against itself,  
that, being thereby weakened, he may the better take opportunity to set up his own accursed powers and dominions.  
It calls aloud then to all in this place in the name of the  
blessed Jesus, and words of his holy apostle (1 Peter v. 6),  
`Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;It is matter of terror, amazement, and astonishment,  
to all such wretched souls (if there be any here in the congregation; and God, of his infinite mercy, grant that none of  
you may ever be found such!) as have given up their names  
and souls to the Devil; who by covenant, explicit or implicit, have bound themselves to be his slaves and drudges,  
consenting to be instruments in whose shapes he may torment and afflict their fellow-creatures (even of their own  
kind) to the amazing and astonishing of the standers-by.  
I would hope I might have spared this use, but I desire  
(by divine assistance) to declare the whole counsel of God;  
and if it come not as conviction where it is so, it may serve  
for warning, that it may never be so. For it is a most  
dreadful thing to consider that any should change the service of God for the service of the Devil, the worship of the  
blessed God for the worship of the cursed enemy of God and  
man. But, oh! (which is yet a thousand times worse) how  
shall I name it? if any that are in the visible covenant of  
<pb n="083" id="vII083"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2086">  
<figDesc>Page 083.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
God should break that covenant, and make a league with  
Satan; if any that have sat down and eat at Christ's Table,  
should so lift up their heel against him as to have fellowship at the table of devils, and (as it hath been represented  
to some of the afflicted) eat of the bread and drink of the  
wine that Satan hath mingled. Surely, if this be so, the  
poet is in the right, &ldquo;Audax omnia perpeti. Gens humana  
ruit per vetitum nefas:&rdquo; audacious mortals are grown to a  
fearful height of impiety; and we must cry out in Scripture  
language, and that emphatical apostrophe of the Prophet  
Jeremy (chap. ii. 12), `Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this,  
and be horribly afraid: be ye very desolate, saith the Lord.'  
... If you are in convenant with the Devil, the intercession  
of the blessed Jesus is against you. His prayer is for the  
subduing of Satan's power and kingdom, and the utter eonfounding of all his instruments. If it be so, then the great  
God is set against you. The omnipotent Jehovah, one God  
in three Persons; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in their  
several distinct operations and all their divine attributes, &mdash;  
are engaged against you. Therefore KNOW YE that are  
guilty of such monstrons iniquity, that He that made you will  
not save you, and that He that formed you will show you no  
favor (Isa. xxvii. 11). Be assured, that, although you  
should now evade the condemnation of man's judgment, and  
escape a violent death by the hand of justice; yet, unless  
God shall give you repentance (which we heartily pray for),  
there is a day coming when the secrets of all hearts shall be  
revealed by Jesus Christ (Rom. ii. 16). Then, then, your sin  
will find you out; and you shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and doomed  
to those endless, easeless, and remediless torments prepared  
for the Devil and his angels (Matt. xxv. 41).... If you  
<pb n="084" id="vII084"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2087">  
<figDesc>Page 084.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
have been guilty of such impiety, the prayers of the people  
of God are against you on that account. It is their duty to  
pray daily, that Satan's kingdom may be suppressed, weakened, brought down, and at last totally destroyed; hence that  
all abettors, subjects, defenders, and promoters thereof, may  
be utterly crushed and confounded. They are constrained  
to suppress that kindness and compassion that in their  
sacred addresses they once bare unto you (as those of their  
own kind, and framed out of the same mould), praying with  
one consent, as the royal prophet did against his malicious  
enemies, the instruments of Satan (Ps. cix. 6), `Set thou  
a wicked man over him, and let Satan stand at his right  
hand' (i.e.), to withstand all that is for his good, and promote  
all that is for his hurt; and (verse 7) `When he is judged,  
let him be condemned, and let his prayer become sin.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Be we exhorted and directed to exercise true spiritual  
sympathy with, and compassion towards, those poor, afflicted  
persons that are by divine permission under the direful influence of Satan's malice. There is a divine precept enjoining the practice of such duty: Heb. xiii. 3, `Remember  
them that suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the  
body.' Let us, then, be deeply sensible, and, as the elect of  
God, put on bowels of mercy towards those in misery  
(Col. iii. 12). Oh, pity, pity them! for the hand of the  
Lord hath touched them, and the malice of devils hath  
fallen upon them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Let us be sure to take unto us and put on the whole  
armor of God, and every piece of it; let none be wanting.  
Let us labor to be in the exercise and practice of the whole  
company of sanctifying graces and religious duties. This  
important duty is pressed, and the particular pieces of that  
armor recited Eph. vi. 11 and 13 to 18. Satan is repre

senting his infernal forces; and the devils seem to come  
armed, mustering amongst us. I am this day commanded  
to call and cry an alarm unto you: <hi rend="smallcaps">Arm, arm, arm!</hi> handle  
your arms, see that you are fixed and in a readiness, as  
faithful soldiers under the Captain of our salvation, that, by  
the shield of faith, ye and we all may resist the fiery darts  
of the wicked; and may be faithful unto death in our  
spiritual warfare; so shall we assuredly receive the crown of  
life (Rev. ii. 10). Let us admit no parley, give no quarter: let none of Satan's forces or furies be more vigilant  
to hurt us than we are to resist and repress them, in the  
name, and by the spirit, grace, and strength of our Lord  
Jesus Christ. Let us play the throne of grace, in the name  
and merit of our Blessed Mediator, taking all possible  
opportunities, public, private, and secret, to pour out our  
supplications to the God of our salvation. Prayer is the  
most proper and potent antidote against the old Serpent's  
venomous operations. When legions of devils do come  
down among us, multitudes of prayers should go up to God.  
Satan, the worst of all our enemies, is called in Scripture a  
dragon, to note his malice; a serpent, to note his subtilty;  
a lion, to note his strength. But none of all these can stand  
before prayer. The most inveterate malice (as that of  
Haman) sinks under the prayer of Esther (chap. iv. 16).  
The deepest policy (the counsel of Achitophel) withers  
before the prayer of David (2 Sam. xv. 31); and the  
vastest army (an host of a thousand thousand Ethiopians)  
ran away, like so many cowards, before the prayer of Asa  
(2 Chron. xiv. 9 to 15).</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What therefore I say unto one I say unto all, in this  
important case, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pray, pray, pray.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;To our honored magistrates, here present this day, to

inquire into these things, give me leave, much honored, to  
offer one word to your consideration. Do all that in you  
lies to check and rebuke Satan; endeavoring, by all ways  
and means that are according to the rule of God, to discover his instruments in these horrid operations. You are  
concerned in the civil government of this people, being invested with power by their Sacred Majesties, under this  
glorious Jesus (the King and Governor of his church), for  
the supporting of Christ's kingdom against all oppositions  
of Satan's kingdom and his instruments. Being ordained  
of God to such a station (Rom. xiii. 1), we entreat you,  
bear not the sword in vain, as ver. 4; but approve yourselves a terror of and punishment to evil-doers, and a praise  
to them that do well (1 Peter ii. 14); ever remembering that ye judge not for men, but for the Lord (2 Chron.  
xix. 6); and, as his promise is, so our prayer shall be for  
you, without ceasing, that he would be with you in the judgment, as he that can and will direct, assist, and reward you.  
Follow the example of the upright Job (chap. xxix. 16): Be  
a father to the poor; to these poor afflicted persons, in pitiful and painful endeavors to help them; and the cause that  
seems to be so dark, as you know not how to determine it,  
do your utmost, in the use of all regular means, to search it  
out.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;There is comfort in considering that the Lord Jesus, the  
Captain of our salvation, hath already overcome the Devil.  
Christ, that blessed seed of the woman, hath given this cursed  
old serpent called the Devil. and Satan a mortal and incurable bruise on the head (Gen. iii. 15). He was too much  
for him in a single conflict (Matt. iv.). He opposed his power  
and kingdom in the possessed. He suffered not the devils  
to speak, because they knew him (Mark i. 34). He completed  
<pb n="087" id="vII087"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2092">  
<figDesc>Page 087.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
his victory by his death on the cross, and destroyed his  
dominion (Heb. ii. 14), that through death he might destroy  
death, and him that had the powers of death, that is the  
Devil; and by and after his resurrection made show openly  
unto the world, that he had spoiled principalities and powers,  
triumphing over them (Col. ii. 15). Hence, if we are by  
faith united to him, his victory is an earnest and prelibation  
of our conquest at last. All Satan's strugglings now are  
but those of a conquered enemy. It is no small comfort to  
consider, that Job's exercise of patience had its beginning  
from the Devil; but we have seen the end to be from the  
Lord (James v. 11). That we also may find by experience  
the same blessed issue of our present distresses by Satan's  
malice, let us repent of every sin that hath been committed,  
and labor to practise every duty which hath been neglected.  
Then we shall assuredly and speedily find that the kingly  
power of our Lord and Saviour shall be magnified, in delivering his poor sheep and lambs out of the jaws and paws of  
the roaring lion.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>These extended extracts are given from Lawson's  
discourse, partly to enable every one to estimate the  
effect it must have produced, under the circumstances  
of the occasion, but mainly because they present a  
living picture of the sentiments, notions, modes of  
thinking and reasoning, and convictions, then prevalent. No description given by a person looking back  
from our point of view, not having experienced the  
delusions of that age, no matter who might attempt  
the task, could adequately paint the scene. The  
foregoing extracts show better, I think, than any documents that have come down to us, how the subject lay  
<pb n="088" id="vII088"/>

in the minds of men at that time. They bring before  
us directly, without the intervention of any secondary  
agency, the thoughts, associations, sentiments, of that  
generation, in breathing reality. They carry us back  
to the hour and to the spot. Deodat Lawson rises from  
his unknown grave, comes forth from the impenetrable  
cloud which enveloped the closing scenes of his mortal  
career, and we listen to his voice, as it spoke to the  
multitudes that gathered in and around the meeting in Salem Village, on Lecture-day, March 24,  
1692. He lays bare his whole mind to our immediate  
inspection. In and through him, we behold the mind  
and heart, the forms of language and thought, the feelings and passions, of the people of that day. We mingle with the crowd that hang upon his lips; we behold  
their countenances, discern the passions that glowed  
upon their features, and enter into the excitement that  
moved and tossed them like a tempest. We are thus  
prepared, as we could be in no other way, to comprehend our story.</p>  
<p>The sermon answered its end. It re-enforced the  
powers that had begun their work. It spread out  
the whole doctrine of witchcraft in a methodical, elaborate, and most impressive form. It justified and commended every thing that had been done, and every  
thing that remained to be done; every step in the proceedings; every process in the examinations; every kind  
of accusation and evidence that had been adduced;  
every phase of the popular belief, however wild and  
monstrous; every pretension of the afflicted children  
<pb n="089" id="vII089"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2094">  
<figDesc>Page 089.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to preternatural experiences and communications, and  
every tale of apparitions of departed spirits and the  
ghosts of murdered men, women, and children, which,  
engendered in morbid and maniac imaginations, had  
been employed to fill him and others with horror, inspire revenge, and drive on the general delirium. And  
it fortified every point by the law and the testimony, by  
passages and scraps of Scripture, studiously and skilfully culled out, and ingeniously applied. It gave  
form to what had been vague, and authority to what  
had floated in blind and baseless dreams of fancy. It  
crystallized the disordered vagaries, that had been  
seething in turbulent confusion in the public mind,  
into a fixed, organized, and permanent shape.</p>  
<p>Its publication was forthwith called for. The manuscript was submitted to Increase and Cotton Mather of  
the North, James Allen and John Bailey of the First,  
Samuel Willard of the Old South, churches in Boston,  
and Charles Morton of the church in Charlestown.  
It was printed with a strong, unqualified indorsement  
of approval, signed by the names severally of these the  
most eminent divines of the country. The discourse  
was dedicated to the &ldquo;worshipful and worthily honored  
Bartholomew Gedney, John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin, Esqrs., together with the reverend Mr. John Higginson, pastor, and Mr. Nicholas Noyes, teacher, of the  
Church of Christ at Salem,&rdquo; with a preface, addressed  
to all his &ldquo;Christian friends and acquaintance, the  
inhabitants of Salem Village.&rdquo; It was republished in  
London in 1704, under the immediate direction of its  
<pb n="090" id="vII090"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2095">  
<figDesc>Page 090.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
author. The subject is described as &ldquo;Christ's Fidelity, the only Shield against Satan's Malignity;&rdquo; and  
the titlepage is enforced by passages of Scripture (Rev.  
xii. 12, and Rom. xvi. 20). The interest of the volume is highly increased by an appendix, giving the  
substance of notes taken by Lawson on the spot, during the examinations and trials. They are invaluable,  
as proceeding from a chief actor in the scenes, who was  
wholly carried away by the delusion. They describe,  
in marvellous colors, the wonderful manifestations of  
diabolical agency in, upon, and through the afflicted  
children; resembling, in many respects, reports of  
spiritual communications prevalent in our day, although not quite coming up to them. These statements, and the preface to the discourse, are given  
in the Appendix to this volume. In a much briefer  
form, it was printed by Benjamin Harris, at Boston,  
in 1692; and soon after by John Dunton, in London.</p>  
<p>Before dismissing Mr. Lawson's famous sermon, our  
attention is demanded to a remarkable paragraph in it.  
His strong faculties could not be wholly bereft of reason; and he had sense enough left to see, what does  
not appear to have occurred to others, that there might  
be a re-action in the popular passions, and that some  
might be called to account by an indignant public, if  
not before a stern tribunal of justice, for the course of  
cruelty and outrage they were pursuing, with so high  
a hand, against accused persons. He was not entirely  
satisfied that the appeal he made in his discourse to  
<pb n="091" id="vII091"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2096">  
<figDesc>Page 091.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the people to suppress and crush out all vestiges of  
human feeling, and to stifle compassion and pity in  
their breasts, would prevail. He foresaw that the  
friends and families of innocent and murdered victims  
might one day call for vengeance; and he attempts to  
provide, beforehand, a defence that is truly ingenious: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Give no place to the Devil by rash censuring of others,  
without sufficient grounds, or false accusing any willingly.  
This is indeed to be like the Devil, who hath the title,  
<unclear></unclear>, in the Greek, because he is the calumniator or  
false accuser. Hence, when we read of such accusers in  
the latter days, they are, in the original, called <unclear></unclear>,  
<hi rend="italics">calumniatores</hi> (2 Tim. iii. 3). It is a time of temptation  
amongst you, such as never was before: let me entreat  
you not to be lavish or severe in reflecting on the malice  
or envy of your neighbors, by whom any of you have been  
accused, lest, whilst you falsely charge one another, &mdash;  
viz., the relations of the afflicted and relations of the accused, &mdash; the grand accuser (who loves to fish in troubled  
waters) should take advantage upon you. Look at sin, the  
procuring cause; God in justice, the sovereign efficient; and  
Satan, the enemy, the principal instrument, both in afflicting  
some and accusing others. And, if innocent persons be suspected, it is to be ascribed to God's pleasure, supremely permitting, and Satan's malice subordinately troubling, by  
representation of such to the afflicting of others, even  
of such as have, all the while, we have reason to believe  
(especially some of them), no kind of ill-will or disrespect  
unto those that have been complained of by them. This  
giving place to the Devil avoid; for it will have uncomfortable  
<pb n="092" id="vII092"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2097">  
<figDesc>Page 092.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and pernicious influence upon the affairs of this place,  
by letting out peace, and bringing in confusion and every  
evil work, which we heartily pray God, in mercy, to prevent.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This artifice of statement, speciously covered, &mdash;  
while it outrages every sentiment of natural justice,  
and breaks every bond of social responsibility, &mdash; is  
found, upon close inspection, to be a shocking imputation against the divine administration. It represents  
the Deity, under the phrases &ldquo;sovereign efficient&rdquo; and  
&ldquo;supremely permitting&rdquo; in a view which affords equal  
shelter to every other class of criminals, even of the  
deepest dye, as well as those who were ready and eager  
to bring upon their neighbors the charge of confederacy  
with Satan.</p>  
<p>The next Sunday &mdash; March 27 &mdash; was the regular  
communion-day of the village church; and Mr. Parris  
prepared duly to improve the occasion to advance the  
movement then so strongly under way, and to deepen  
still more the impression made by the events of the  
week, especially by Mr. Lawson's sermon. He accordingly composed an elaborate and effective discourse of  
his own; and a scene was arranged to follow the regular  
service, which could not but produce important results.  
An unexpected occurrence &mdash; a part not in the programme &mdash; took place, which created a sensation for  
the moment; but it tended, upon the whole, to heighten  
the public excitement, and, without much disturbing  
the order, only precipitated a little the progress of  
events.</p>  
<pb n="093" id="vII093"/>

</p>  
<p>It may well be supposed, that the congregation assembled that day with minds awfully solemnized, and  
altogether in a condition to be deeply affected by the  
services. A respectable person always prominently  
noticeable for her devout participation in the worship  
of the sanctuary, and a member of the church, had,  
on Monday, after a public examination, been committed to prison, and was there in irons, waiting to be  
tried for her life for the blackest of crimes, &mdash; a confederacy with the enemy of the souls of men, the  
archtraitor and rebel against the throne of God.  
On Thursday, another venerable, and ever before  
considered pious, matron of a large and influential  
family, a participant in their worship, and a member of  
the mother-church, had been consigned to the same  
fate, to be tried for the same horrible crime. A little  
child had been proved to have also joined in the infernal league. No one could tell to what extent Satan  
had lengthened his chain, or who, whether old or  
young, were in league with him. Every soul was still  
alive to the impressions made by Mr. Lawson's great  
discourse, and by the throngs of excited people, including magistrates and ministers, that had been gathered in the village.</p>  
<p>The character and spirit of Mr. Parris's sermon are  
indicated in a prefatory note in the manuscript, &ldquo;occasioned by dreadful witchcraft broke out here a few  
weeks past; and one member of this church, and another  
of Salem, upon public examination by civil authority,  
vehemently suspected for she-witches.&rdquo; The running  
<pb n="094" id="vII094"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2099">  
<figDesc>Page 094.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
title is, &ldquo;Christ knows how many devils there are in  
his church, and who they are;&rdquo; and the text is John  
vi. 70, 71, &ldquo;Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen  
you twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of  
Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he it was that  
should betray him, being one of the twelve.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Peter Cloyse was born May 27, 1639. He came to  
Salem from York, in Maine, and was one of the original members of the village church. He appears to  
have been a person of the greatest respectability and  
strength of character. He married Sarah, sister of  
Rebecca Nurse, and widow of Edmund Bridges. She  
was admitted to the village church, Jan. 12, 1690, being then about forty-eight years of age. It may well  
be supposed that she and her family were overwhelmed  
with affliction and horror by the proceedings against  
her sister. But, as she and her husband were both  
communicants, and it was sacrament-day, it was  
thought best for them to summon resolution to attend  
the service. After much persuasion, she was induced  
to go. She was a very sensitive person, and it must  
have required a great effort of fortitude. Her mind  
was undoubtedly much harrowed by the allusions made  
to the events of the week; and, when Mr. Parris announced his text, and opened his discourse in the  
spirit his language indicates, she could bear it no  
longer, but rose, and left the meeting. A fresh wind  
blowing at the time caused the door to slam after her.  
The congregation was probably startled; but Parris  
was not long embarrassed by the interruption, and  
<pb n="095" id="vII095"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2100">  
<figDesc>Page 095.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
she was attended to in due season. At the close  
of the service, the following scene occurred. I  
give it as Parris describes it in his church-record  
book: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;After the common auditory was dismissed, and before  
the church's communion at the Lord's Table, the following  
testimony against the error of our Sister Mary Sibley, who  
had given direction to my Indian man in an unwarrantable  
way to find out witches, was read by the pastor: &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;It is altogether undeniable that our great and blessed  
God, for wise and holy ends, hath suffered many persons,  
in several families, of this little village, to be grievously  
vexed and tortured in body, and to be deeply tempted, to  
the endangering of the destruction of their souls; and all  
these amazing feats (well known to many of us) to be done  
by witchcraft and diabolical operations. It is also well  
known, that, when these calamities first began, which was  
in my own family, the affliction was several weeks before  
such hellish operations as witchcraft were suspected. Nay,  
it was not brought forth to any considerable light, until  
diabolical means were used by the making of a cake by  
my Indian man, who had his direction from this our sister,  
Mary Sibley; since which, apparitions have been plenty,  
and exceeding much mischief hath followed. But, by these  
means (it seems), the Devil hath been raised amongst us,  
and his rage is vehement and terrible; and, when he shall  
be silenced, the Lord only knows. But now that this our  
sister should be instrumental to such distress is a great  
grief to myself, and our godly honored and reverend neighbors, who have had the knowledge of it. Nevertheless, I  
do truly hope and believe, that this our sister doth truly  
<pb n="096" id="vII096"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2101">  
<figDesc>Page 096.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fear the Lord; and I am well satisfied from her, that, what  
she did, she did it ignorantly, from what she had heard of  
this nature from other ignorant or worse persons. Yet we  
are in duty bound to protest against such actions, as being  
indeed a going to the Devil for help against the Devil: we  
having no such directions from nature, or God's word, it  
must therefore be, and is, accounted, by godly Protestants  
who write or speak of such matters, as diabolical; and therefore calls this our sister to deep humiliation for what she  
has done, and all of us to be watchful against Satan's wiles  
and devices.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, as we, in duty as a church of Christ, are  
deeply bound to protest against it, as most directly contrary  
to the gospel, yet, inasmuch as this our sister did it in ignorance as she professeth and we believe, we can continue her  
in our holy fellowship, upon her serious promise of future  
better advisedness and caution, and acknowledging that she  
is indeed sorrowful for her rashness herein.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, if this be your mind, that this iniquity should  
be thus borne witness against, manifest it by your usual sign  
of lifting up your hands. &mdash; The brethren voted generally, or  
universally: none made any exceptions.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Sister Sibley, if you are convinced that you herein did  
sinfully, and are sorry for it, let us hear it from your own  
mouth. &mdash; She did manifest to satisfaction her error and grief  
for it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, if herein you have received satisfaction,  
testify it by lifting up your hands. &mdash; A general vote passed;  
no exception made.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Note.</hi> &mdash; 25th March, 1692. I discoursed said sister  
in my study about her grand error aforesaid, and also then  
read to her what I had written as above to be read to the  
<pb n="097" id="vII097"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2102">  
<figDesc>Page 097.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
church; and said Sister Sibley assented to the same with  
tears and sorrowful confession.'</p></q>  
<p>This proceeding was of more importance than appears, perhaps, at first view. It was one of Mr. Parris most skilful moves. The course pursued by the  
&ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; persons had, thus far, in reference to  
those engaged in the prosecutions, been in the right  
direction. But it was manifest, after the exhibitions  
they had given, that they wielded a fearful power, too  
fearful to be left without control. They could cry  
out upon whomsoever they pleased; and against their  
accusations, armed as they were with the power to  
fix the charge of guilt upon any one by giving ocular  
demonstration that he or she was the author of their  
sufferings, there could be no defence. They might  
turn, at any moment, and cry out upon Parris or  
Lawson, or either or both of the deacons. Nothing  
could withstand the evidence of their fits, convulsions, and tortures. It was necessary to have and  
keep them under safe control, and, to this end, to  
prevent any outsiders, or any injudicious or intermeddling people, from holding intimacy with them.  
Parris saw this, and, with his characteristic boldness  
of action and fertility of resources, at once put a stop  
to all trouble, and closed the door against danger,  
from this quarter.</p>  
<p>Samuel Sibley was a member of the church, and a  
near neighbor of Mr. Parris. He was about thirty years of age. His wife Mary was thirty-two years  
of age, and also a member of the church. They  
<pb n="098" id="vII098"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2103">  
<figDesc>Page 098.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
were persons of respectable standing and good repute.  
Nothing is known to her disadvantage, but her foolish connection with the mystical operations going on  
in Mr. Parris's family; and of this she was heartily  
ashamed. Her penitent sensibility is quite touchingly described by Mr. Parris. It is true that what  
she had done was a trifle in comparison with what  
was going on every day in the families of Mr. Parris  
and Thomas Putnam: but she had acted &ldquo;rashly,&rdquo;  
without &ldquo;advisedness&rdquo; from the right quarter, under  
the lead of &ldquo;ignorant persons;&rdquo; and therefore it was  
necessary to make a great ado about it, and hold her  
up as a warning to prevent other persons from meddling in such matters. Her husband was an uncle  
of Mary Walcot, one of the afflicted children; and  
it was particularly important to keep their relatives,  
and members of their immediate families, from taking  
any part or action in connection with them, except  
under due &ldquo;advisedness,&rdquo; and the direction of persons  
learned in such deep matters. The family connections of the Sibleys were extensive, and a blow struck  
at that point would be felt everywhere. The procedure was undoubtedly effectual. After Mary Sibley  
had been thus awfully rebuked and distressingly exposed for dealing with &ldquo;John Indian,&rdquo; it is not likely  
that any one else ever ventured to intermeddle with  
the &ldquo;afflicted,&rdquo; or have any connection, except as  
outside spectators, with the marvellous phenomena  
of &ldquo;diabolical operations.&rdquo; It will be noticed, that,  
while Mr. Parris thus waved the sword of disciplinary  
<pb n="099" id="vII099"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2104">  
<figDesc>Page 099.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
vengeance against any who should dare to intrude  
upon the forbidden ground, he occupied it himself  
without disguise, and maintained his hold upon it.  
He asserts the reality of the &ldquo;amazing feats&rdquo; practised by diabolical power in their midst, and enforces  
in the strongest language the then prevalent views  
and pending proceedings.</p>  
<p>The operations of the week, including the solemn  
censure of Mary Sibley, had all worked favorably for  
the prosecutors and managers of the business. The  
magistrates, ministers, and whole body of the people,  
had become committed; the accusing girls had proved  
themselves apt and competent to their work; the public  
reason was prostrated, and natural sensibility stunned.  
All resisting forces were powerless, and all collateral  
dangers avoided and provided against. The movement was fully in hand. The next step was maturely  
considered, and, as we shall see, skilfully taken.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that there was, at this time,  
a break in the regular government of Massachusetts.  
In the spring of 1689, the people had risen, seized  
the royal governor, Sir Edmund Andros, and put  
him in prison. They summoned their old charter  
governor, Simon Bradstreet, then living in Salem,  
eighty-seven years of age, to the chair of state; called  
the assistants of 1686 back to their seats, who provided for an election of representatives by the people  
of the towns; and the government thus created conducted affairs until the arrival of Sir William Phipps,  
in May, 1692, when Massachusetts ceased to be a  
<pb n="100" id="vII100"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2105">  
<figDesc>Page 100.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
colony, and was thenceforth, until 1774, a royal prov  
<unclear></unclear>. During these three years, from May, 1689, to  
May, 1692, the government was based upon an uprising of the people. It was a period of pure and  
absolute independence of the crown or parliament  
of England. Although Bradstreet's faculties were unimpaired and his spirit true and firm, his age prevented his doing much more than to give his loved  
and venerated name to the daring movement, and to  
the official service, of the people. The executive functions were, for the most part, exercised by the deputy, Thomas Danforth, who was a person of  
great ability and public spirit. Unfortunately, at this  
time he was zealously in favor of the witchcraft prosecutions. Bradstreet was throughout opposed to them.  
Had time held off its hand, and his physical energies  
not been impaired, he would undoubtedly have resisted and prevented them. Danforth, it is said by  
Brattle, came to disapprove of them finally: but he  
began them by arrests in other towns, months before  
any thing of the kind was thought of in Salem Village;  
and he contributed, prominently, to give destructive  
and wide-spread power, in an early stage of its development, to the witchcraft delusion here.</p>  
<p>After the lapse of a week, preparations were completed to renew operations, and a higher and more commanding character given to them. On Monday, April 4,  
Captain Jonathan Walcot and Lieutenant Nathaniel  
Ingersoll went to the town, and, &ldquo;for themselves and  
several of their neighbors,&rdquo; exhibited to the assistants  
<pb n="101" id="vII101"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2106">  
<figDesc>Page 101.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
residing there, John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin,  
complaints against &ldquo;Sarah Cloyse, the wife of Peter  
Cloyse of Salem Village, and Elizabeth Procter of  
Salem Farms, for high suspicion of sundry acts of  
witchcraft.&rdquo; There the plan of proceedings in reference to the above-said parties was agreed upon. It  
was the result of consultation; communications probably passing with the deputy-governor in Boston, or  
at his residence in Cambridge. On the 8th of April,  
warrants were duly issued, ordering the marshal to  
bring in the prisoners &ldquo;on Monday morning next,  
being the eleventh day of this instant April, about  
eleven of the clock, in the public meeting-house in the  
town.&rdquo; It had been arranged, that the examination  
should not be, as before, in the ordinary way, before  
the two local magistrates, but, in an extraordinary  
way, before the highest tribunal in the colony, or a  
representation of it. For a preliminary hearing, with  
a view merely to commitment for trial, this surely may  
justly be characterized as an extraordinary, wholly  
irregular, and, in all points of view, reprehensible  
procedure. When the day came, the meeting-house,  
which was much more capacious than that at the  
village, was crowded; and the old town filled with  
excited throngs. Upon opening proceedings, lo and  
behold, instead of the two magistrates, the government  
of the colony was present, in the highest character  
it then had as &ldquo;a council&rdquo;! The record says, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Salem, April 11, 1692. &mdash; At a Council held at Salem,  
and present Thomas Danforth, Esq., deputy-governor;

James Russell, John Hathorne, Isaac Addington, Major  
Samuel Appleton, Captain Samuel Sewall, Jonathan Corwin, Esquires.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Russell was of Charlestown, Addington and Sewall  
of Boston, and Appleton of Ipswich. Mr. Parris,  
&ldquo;being desired and appointed to write the examination, did take the same, and also read it before the  
council in public.&rdquo; This document has not come  
down to us; but Hutchinson had access to it, and  
the substance of it is preserved in his &ldquo;History of  
Massachusetts.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The marshal (Herrick) brought in Sarah Cloyse  
and Elizabeth Procter, and delivered them &ldquo;before  
the honorable council:&rdquo; and the examination was  
begun.</p>  
<p>The deputy-governor first called to the stand John  
Indian, and plied him, as was the course pursued on  
all these occasions, with leading questions: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;John, who hurt you? &mdash; Goody Procter first, and then  
Goody Cloyse.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did she do to you? &mdash; She brought the book to  
me.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;John, tell the truth: who hurts you? Have you been  
hurt? &mdash; The first was a gentlewoman I saw.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who next? &mdash; Goody Cloyse.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;But who hurt you next? &mdash; Goody Procter.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did she do to you? &mdash; She choked me, and  
brought the book.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How oft did she come to torment you? &mdash; A good many  
times, she and Goody Cloyse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they come to you in the night, as well as the day?

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Goody Cloyse and Goody Procter? &mdash;  
Yes: here is Goody Cloyse.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>We may well suppose that these two respectable  
women must have been filled with indignation, shocked,  
and amazed at the statements made by the Indian,  
following the leading interrogatories of the Court.  
Sarah Cloyse broke out, &ldquo;When did I hurt thee?&rdquo;  
He answered, &ldquo;A great many times.&rdquo; She exclaimed,  
&ldquo;Oh, you are a grievous liar!&rdquo; The Court proceeded  
with their questions: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;What did this Goody Cloyse do to you? &mdash; She pinched  
and bit me till the blood came.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How long since this woman came and hurt you? &mdash; Yesterday, at meeting.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;At any time before? &mdash; Yes: a great many times.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Having drawn out John Indian, the Court turned to  
the other afflicted ones: &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Mary Walcot, who hurts you? &mdash; Goody Cloyse.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did she do to you? &mdash; She hurt me.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did she bring the book? &mdash; Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What was you to do with it? &mdash; To touch it, and be  
well.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Then she fell into a fit.)&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This put a stop to the examination for a time; but  
it was generally quite easy to bring witnesses out of a  
<pb n="104" id="vII104"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2109">  
<figDesc>Page 104.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fit, and restore entire calmness of mind. All that was  
necessary was to lift them up, and carry them to the  
accused person, the touch of any part of whose body  
would, in an instant, relieve the sufferer. This having  
been done, the examination proceeded: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Doth she come alone? &mdash; Sometimes alone, and sometimes in company with Goody Nurse and Goody Corey, and  
a great many I do not know.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Then she fell into a fit again.)&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>She was, probably, restored in the same way as before; but, her part being finished for that stage of the  
proceeding, another of the afflicted children took the  
stand: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Abigail Williams, did you see a company at Mr. Parris house eat and drink? &mdash; Yes, sir: that was in the  
sacrament.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>I would call attention to the form of the foregoing  
questions. Hutchinson says that &ldquo;Mr. Parris was  
over-officious: most of the examinations, although in  
the presence of one or more magistrates, were taken  
by him.&rdquo; He put the questions. They show, on this  
occasion, a minute knowledge beforehand of what the  
witnesses are to say, which it cannot be supposed  
Danforth, Russell, Addington, Appleton, and Sewall,  
strangers, as they were, to the place and the details of  
the affair, could have had. The examination proceeded: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;How many were there? &mdash; About forty, and Goody  
Cloyse and Goody Good were their deacons.</p>  
<pb n="105" id="vII105"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2110">  
<figDesc>Page 105.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What was it? &mdash; They said it was our blood, and they  
had it twice that day.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The interrogator again turned to Mary Walcot, and  
inquired, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Have you seen a white man? &mdash; Yes, sir: a great many  
times.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a man was he? &mdash; A fine grave man; and,  
when he came, he made all the witches to tremble.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Abigail Williams confirmed the same, and that they had  
such a sight at Deacon Ingersoll's.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who was at Deacon Ingersoll's then? &mdash; Goody Cloyse,  
Goody Nurse, Goody Corey, and Goody Good.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Then Sarah Cloyse asked for water, and sat down, as  
one seized with a dying, fainting fit; and several of the  
afflicted fell into fits, and some of them cried out, `Oh! her  
spirit has gone to prison to her sister Nurse.')&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The audacious lying of the witnesses; the horrid  
monstrousness of their charges against Sarah Cloyse,  
of having bitten the flesh of the Indian brute, and  
drank herself and distributed to others, as deacon, at  
an infernal sacrament, the blood of the wicked creatures making these foul and devilish declarations,  
known by her to be utterly and wickedly false; and  
the fact that they were believed by the deputy, the  
council, and the assembly, &mdash; were more than she  
could bear. Her soul sickened at such unimaginable  
depravity and wrong; her nervous system gave way;  
she fainted, and sunk to the floor. The manner in  
which the girls turned the incident against her shows  
how they were hardened to all human feeling, and the  
<pb n="106" id="vII106"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2111">  
<figDesc>Page 106.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
cunning art which, on all occasions, characterized their  
proceedings. That such an insolent interruption and  
disturbance, on their part, was permitted, without rebuke from the Court, is a perpetual dishonor to every  
member of it. The scene exhibited at this moment,  
in the meeting-house, is worthy of an attempt to imagine. The most terrible sensation was naturally produced, by the swooning of the prisoner, the loudly  
uttered and savage mockery of the girls, and their  
going simultaneously into fits, screaming at the top of  
their voices, twisting into all possible attitudes, stiffened  
as in death, or gasping with convulsive spasms of  
agony, and crying out, at intervals, &ldquo;There is the black  
man whispering in Cloyse's ear,&rdquo; &ldquo;There is a yellow flying round her head.&rdquo; John Indian, on such  
occasions, used to confine his achievements to tumbling, and rolling his ugly body about the floor. The  
deepest commiseration was felt by all for the &ldquo;afflicted,&rdquo; and men and women rushed to hold and soothe  
them. There was, no doubt, much loud screeching, and  
some miscellaneous faintings, through the whole crowd.  
At length, by bringing the sufferers into contact with  
Goody Cloyse, the diabolical fluid passed back into her,  
they were all relieved, and the examination was resumed. Elizabeth Procter was now brought forward.</p>  
<p>In the account given, in the First Part, of the population of Salem Village and the contiguous farms, her  
husband, John Procter, was introduced to our acquaintance. From what we then saw of him, we are  
well assured that he would not shrink from the protection  
<pb n="107" id="vII107"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2112">  
<figDesc>Page 107.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and defence of his wife. He accompanied her  
from her arrest to her arraignment, and stood by  
her side, a strong, brave, and resolute guardian, trying  
to support her under the terrible trials of her situation,  
and ready to comfort and aid her to the extent of his  
power, disregardful of all consequences to himself.  
The examination proceeded: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Procter, you understand whereof you are  
charged; viz., to be guilty of sundry acts of witchcraft.  
What say you to it? Speak the truth; and so you that are  
afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you will answer it before God another day. Mary Walcot, doth this woman hurt  
you? &mdash; I never saw her so as to be hurt by her.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Mercy Lewis, does she hurt you?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Her mouth was stopped.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Ann Putnam, does she hurt you?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(She could not speak.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Abigail Williams, does she hurt you?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Her hand was thrust in her own mouth.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;John, does she hurt you? &mdash; This is the woman that  
came in her shift, and choked me.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did she ever bring the book? &mdash; Yes, sir.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What to do? &mdash; To write.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What? this woman? &mdash; Yes, sir.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of it? &mdash; Yes, sir.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Again Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam were spoke  
to by the Court; but neither of them could make any answer,  
by reason of dumbness or other fits.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Goody Procter, to these things? &mdash;  
I take God in heaven to be my witness, that I know nothing  
of it, no more than the child unborn.</p>  
<pb n="108" id="vII108"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2113">  
<figDesc>Page 108.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Ann Putnam, doth this woman hurt you? &mdash; Yes, sir: a  
great many times.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Then the accused looked upon them, and they fell into  
fits.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;She does not bring the book to you, does she? &mdash; Yes, sir,  
often; and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Abigail Williams, does this woman hurt you? &mdash; Yes,  
sir, often.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Does she bring the book to you? &mdash; Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What would she have you do with it? &mdash; To write in  
it, and I shall be well.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Turning to the accused, Abigail said, &ldquo;Did not  
you tell me that your maid had written?&rdquo; Goody  
Procter seems to have been utterly amazed at the  
conduct and charges of the girls. She knew, of  
course, that what they said was false; but perhaps she  
thought them crazy, and therefore objects of pity and  
compassion, and felt disposed to treat them kindly,  
and see whether they could not be recalled to their  
senses, and restored to their better nature: for Parris,  
in his account, says that at this point she answered the  
question thus put to her by Abigail thus: &ldquo;Dear child,  
it is not so. There is another judgment, dear child.&rdquo;  
But kindness was thrown away upon them; for Parris says that immediately &ldquo;Abigail and Ann had  
fits.&rdquo; After coming out of them, &ldquo;they cried out,  
`Look you! there is Goody Procter upon the beam.&rdquo;'  
Instantly, as we may well suppose, the whole audience  
looked where they pointed. Their manner gave assurance that they saw her &ldquo;on the beam,&rdquo; among the  
<pb n="109" id="vII109"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2114">  
<figDesc>Page 109.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
rafters of the meeting-house; but she was invisible to  
all other eyes. The people, no doubt, were filled with  
amazement at such supernaturalism. But John Procter, her husband, did not believe a word of it: and it  
is not to be doubted that he expressed his indignation  
at the nonsense and the outrage in his usual bold,  
strong, and unguarded language, which brought down  
the vengeance of the girls at once on his own head;  
for Parris, in his report, goes on to say: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;(By and by, both of them cried out of Goodman Procter  
himself, and said he was a wizard. Immediately, many if  
not all of the bewitched had grievous fits.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Ann Putnam, who hurt you? &mdash; Goodman Procter, and  
his wife too.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Afterwards, some of the afflicted cried, `There is Procter going to take up Mrs. Pope's feet!' and her feet were  
immediately taken up.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Goodman Procter, to these things? &mdash;  
I know not. I am innocent.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Abigail Williams cried out, `There is Goodman Procter going to Mrs. Pope!' and immediately said Pope fell  
into a fit.)&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>At this point, the deputy, or some member of the  
Court interposed, if I interpret rightly Parris's report,  
which is here obscurely expressed, inasmuch as he  
does not say who spoke; but the import of the words  
indicates that they proceeded from some member of  
the Court, who was perfectly deceived: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;You see, the Devil will deceive you: the children could  
see what you was going to do before the woman was hurt.  
<pb n="110" id="vII110"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2115">  
<figDesc>Page 110.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
I would advise you to repentance, for the Devil is bringing  
you out.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Abigail Williams cried out again, `There is Goodman  
Procter going to hurt Goody Bibber!' and immediately  
Goody Bibber fell into a fit. There was the like of Mary  
Walcot, and divers others. Benjamin Gould gave in his  
testimony, that he had seen Goodman Corey and his wife,  
Procter and his wife, Goody Cloyse, Goody Nurse, and  
Goody Griggs in his chamber last Thursday night. Elizabeth Hubbard was in a trance during the whole examination.  
During the examination of Elizabeth Procter, Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam both made offer to strike at said  
Procter; but, when Abigail's hand came near, it opened, &mdash;  
whereas it was made up into a fist before, &mdash; and came down  
exceeding lightly as it drew near to said Procter, and at  
length, with open and extended fingers, touched Procter's  
hood very lightly. Immediately, Abigail cried out, her fingers, her fingers, her fingers burned; and Ann Putnam took  
on most grievously of her head, and sunk down.)&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Hutchinson, after giving Parris's account of this  
examination, expresses himself thus: &ldquo;No wonder the  
whole country was in a consternation, when persons of  
sober lives and unblemished characters were committed to prison upon such sort of evidence. Nobody  
was safe.&rdquo; All things considered, it may perhaps be  
said, that, filled as the witchcraft proceedings were  
throughout with folly and outrage, there was nothing  
worse than this examination, conducted by the deputy and council, on the 11th of April, 1692, in  
the great meeting-house of the First Church in Salem.  
It must have been a scene of the wildest disorder, particularly  
<pb n="111" id="vII111"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2116">  
<figDesc>Page 111.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in the latter part of it. No wonder that the  
people in general were deluded, when the most learned  
councillors of the colony countenanced, participated  
in, and gave effect to, such disorderly procedures in a  
house of worship, in the presence of a high judicial  
tribunal, and of the then supreme government of the  
colony!</p>  
<p>Benjamin Gould gave his volunteer testimony without &ldquo;advisedness,&rdquo; and quite incontinently. He  
brought out Goodman Corey before the managers were  
quite ready to fall upon him; and he antedated, by a  
considerable length of time, any such imputation upon  
Goody Griggs. It was well for Elizabeth Hubbard to  
have been in a trance, so that she could not hear the  
mention of her aunt's name. The council seems to  
have adjourned to the next day, at the same place,  
when Mr. Parris &ldquo;gave further information against  
said John Procter,&rdquo; which, unfortunately, has not  
come down to us. The result was, that Sarah Cloyse,  
John Procter, and Elizabeth his wife, were all committed for trial, and, with Rebecca Nurse, Martha Corey,  
and Dorcas Good, were sent to the jail in Boston, in the  
custody of Marshal Herrick.</p>  
<p>The proceedings of the 11th and 12th of April produced a great effect in driving on the general infatuation. Judge Sewall, who was present as one of the  
council, in his diary at this date, says, &ldquo;Went to  
Salem, where, in the meeting-house, the persons accused of witchcraft were examined; was a very great  
assembly; 'twas awful to see how the afflicted persons  
<pb n="112" id="vII112"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2117">  
<figDesc>Page 112.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
were agitated.&rdquo; In the margin is written, apparently  
some time afterwards, the interjection &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">V&oelig;!</hi>&rdquo; thrice  
repeated, &mdash; &ldquo;Alas, alas, alas!&rdquo; What perfectly deluded him and Danforth, and everybody else, were the  
exhibitions made by the &ldquo;afflicted children.&rdquo; This is  
the grand phenomenon of the witchcraft proceedings  
here in 1692. It, and it alone, carried them through.  
Those girls, by long practice in &ldquo;the circle,&rdquo; and day  
by day, before astonished and wondering neighbors  
gathered to witness their distresses, and especially on  
the more public occasions of the examinations, had  
acquired consummate boldness and tact. In simulation of passions, sufferings, and physical affections; in  
sleight of hand, and in the management of voice and  
feature and attitude, &mdash; no necromancers have surpassed them. There has seldom been better acting in  
a theatre than they displayed in the presence of the  
astonished and horror-stricken rulers, magistrates,  
ministers, judges, jurors, spectators, and prisoners.  
No one seems to have dreamed that their actings and  
sufferings could have been the result of cunning or  
imposture. Deodat Lawson was a man of talents, had  
seen much of the world, and was by no means a simpleton, recluse, or novice; but he was wholly deluded by  
them. The prisoners, although conscious of their own  
innocence, were utterly confounded by the acting of the  
girls. The austere principles of that generation forbade, with the utmost severity, all theatrical shows and  
performances. But at Salem Village and the old  
town, in the respective meeting-houses, and at Deacon  
<pb n="113" id="vII113"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2118">  
<figDesc>Page 113.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Nathaniel Ingersoll's, some of the best playing ever got  
up in this country was practised; and patronized, for  
weeks and months, at the very centre and heart of  
Puritanism, by &ldquo;the most straitest sect&rdquo; of that  
solemn order of men. Pastors, deacons, church, doctors of divinity, college professors, officers  
of state, crowded, day after day, to behold feats which  
have never been surpassed on the boards of any theatre; which rivalled the most memorable achievements  
of pantomimists, thaumaturgists, and stage-players;  
and made considerable approaches towards the best  
performances of ancient sorcerers and magicians, or  
modern jugglers and mesmerizers.</p>  
<p>The meeting of the council at Salem, on the 11th of  
April, 1692, changed in one sense the whole character of the transaction. Before, it had been a Salem  
affair. After this, it was a Massachusetts affair. The  
colonial government at Boston had obtruded itself  
upon the ground, and, of its own will and seeking, irregularly, and without call or justification, had taken  
the whole thing out of the hands of the local authorities into its own management. Neither the town nor  
the village of Salem is responsible, as a principal  
actor, for what subsequently took place. To that  
meeting of the deputy-governor and his associates  
in the colonial administration, at an early period of  
the transaction, the calamities, outrages, and shame  
that followed must in justice be ascribed. Had it  
not taken place, the delusion, as in former instances  
and other places here and in the mother-country,  
<pb n="114" id="vII114"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2119">  
<figDesc>Page 114.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
would have remained within its original local limits,  
and soon disappeared. That meeting, and the proceedings then had, gave to the fanaticism the momentum that drove it on, and extended its destructive  
influence far and wide.</p>  
<p>The next step in the proceedings is one of the most  
remarkable features in the case. It is, in some points  
of view, more suggestive of suspicion, that there was,  
behind the whole, a skilful and cunning management,  
ingeniously contriving schemes to mislead the public  
mind, than almost any other part of the transaction.  
Mary Warren, as has been said, was a servant in the  
family of John Procter. She was a member of the  
&ldquo;circle&rdquo; that had so long met at Mr. Parris's house  
or Thomas Putnam's. She was a constant attendant  
at its meetings, and a leading spirit among the girls.  
She did not take an open part against her master or  
mistress at their examination, although she acted  
with avidity and malignity against them as an accusing witness at their trials, two months afterwards.  
It is to be noticed, that Ann Putnam and Abigail  
Williams, at the examination of Elizabeth Procter,  
April 11, accused her of having induced or compelled &ldquo;her maid to set her hand to the book.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>On the 18th of April, warrants were got out against  
Giles Corey and Mary Warren, both of Salem Farms;  
Abigail Hobbs, daughter of William Hobbs, of Topsfield; and Bridget Bishop, wife of Edward Bishop, of  
Salem, &mdash; to be brought in the next forenoon, at about  
eight o'clock, at the house of Lieutenant Nathaniel  
<pb n="115" id="vII115"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2120">  
<figDesc>Page 115.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Ingersoll, of Salem Village. How Mary Warren became transformed from an accuser to an accused,  
from an afflicted person to an afflicter, is the question.  
It is not easy to fathom the conduct of these girls.  
They appear to have acted upon a plan deliberately  
formed, and to have had an understanding with each  
other. At the same time, occasionally, they had or  
pretended to have a falling-out, and came into contradiction. This was perhaps a mere blind, to prevent the suspicion of collusion. The accounts given  
of Mary Warren seem to render it quite certain that  
she acted with deliberate cunning, and was a guilty  
conspirator with the other accusers in carrying on  
the plot from the beginning. No doubt, it frequently  
occurred to those concerned in it, that suspicions  
might possibly get into currency that they were acting  
a part in concert. It was necessary, by all means, to  
guard against such an idea. This may be the key to  
interpret the arrest and proceedings against Mary  
Warren. If it is, the affair, it must be confessed, was  
managed with great shrewdness and skill. She conducted the stratagem most dexterously. All at once  
she fell away from the circle, and began to talk against  
the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; and went so far as to say,  
that they &ldquo;did but dissemble.&rdquo; Immediately, they  
cried out upon her, charged her with witchcraft, and  
had her apprehended. After being carried to prison,  
she spoke in strong language against the proceedings.  
Four persons of unquestionable truthfulness, in prison  
with her, on the same charge, prepared a deposition  
<pb n="116" id="vII116"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2121">  
<figDesc>Page 116.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to this effect: &ldquo;We heard Mary Warren several times  
say that the magistrates might as well examine Keysar daughter that had been distracted many years,  
and take notice of what she said, as well as any of the  
afflicted persons. `For,' said Mary Warren, `when I was  
afflicted, I thought I saw the apparitions of a hundred  
persons;' for she said her head was distempered that  
she could not tell what she said. And the said Mary  
told us, that, when she was well again, she could not  
say that she saw any of the apparitions at the time  
aforesaid.&rdquo; I will now give the substance of her examination, which commenced on the 19th of April.  
Mr. Parris was, as usual, requested to take minutes  
of the proceedings, which have been preserved: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Examination of Mary Warren, at a Court held at Salem  
Village, by John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, Esqrs.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;(As soon as she was coming towards the bar, the afflicted  
fell into fits.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Mary Warren, you stand here charged with sundry  
acts of witchcraft. What do you say for yourself? Are  
you guilty or not? &mdash; I am innocent.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Hath she hurt you? (Speaking to the sufferers.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Some were dumb. Betty Hubbard testified against  
her, and then said Hubbard fell into a violent fit.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;You were, a little while ago, an afflicted person; now  
you are an afflicter. How comes this to pass? &mdash; I look  
up to God, and take it to be a great mercy of God.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What! do you take it to be a great mercy to afflict  
others?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Now they were all but John Indian grievously afflicted,  
<pb n="117" id="vII117"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2122">  
<figDesc>Page 117.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and Mrs. Pope also, who was not afflicted before hitherto  
this day; and, after a few moments, John Indian fell into  
a violent fit also.)&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rdquo; (Mr. Parris, the reporter, goes on  
to say) &ldquo;was one that just now was a tormenter in  
her apparition, and she owns that she had made a  
league with the Devil.&rdquo; The marvel was, that, having  
before been a sufferer, as one of the afflicted accusers,  
she had then, at that moment, appeared in the opposite character, and owned herself to have become a  
confederate with the Evil One. Having established  
this conviction in the minds of the magistrates and  
spectators, the point was reached at which she completed the delusion by appearing to break away from  
her bondage to Satan, assume the functions of a confessing and abjuring witch, and retake her place, with  
tenfold effect, among the accusing witnesses. The  
manner in which she rescued herself from the power  
of Satan exhibits a specimen of acting seldom surpassed. The account proceeds thus: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Now Mary Warren fell into a fit, and some of the  
afflicted cried out that she was going to confess; but Goody  
Corey, and Procter and his wife, came in, <hi rend="italics">in their apparition,</hi>  
and struck her down, and said she should tell nothing.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>What is given here in <hi rend="italics">Italics,</hi> as an &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">apparition,</hi>&rdquo;  
was of course based upon the declarations of the  
accusing witnesses. It was an art they often practised in offering their testimony. They would cry  
out, that the Devil, generally in the shape of a black  
man, appeared to them at the time, whispering in the  
<pb n="118" id="vII118"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2123">  
<figDesc>Page 118.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
ear of the accused, or sitting on the beams of the  
meeting-house in which the examinations were generally conducted. On this occasion, they declared that  
three of the persons, then in jail in some other place,  
came in their apparitions, forbade Mary Warren's  
confession, and struck her down. To give full effect  
to their statement, she went through the process of  
tumbling down. Although nothing was seen by any  
other person present, the deception was perfect. The  
Rev. Mr. Parris wrote it all down as having actually  
occurred. His record of the transaction goes on as  
follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Mary Warren continued a good space in a fit, that she  
did neither see nor hear nor speak.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards she started up, and said, `I will speak,' and  
cried out, `Oh, I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it!' and  
wringed her hands, and fell a little while into a fit again,  
and then came to speak, but immediately her teeth were  
set; and then she fell into a violent fit, and cried out, `O  
Lord, help me! O good Lord, save me!'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And then afterwards cried again, `I will tell, I will  
tell!' and then fell into a dead fit again.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And afterwards cried, `I will tell, they did, they did,  
they did;' and then fell into a violent fit again.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;After a little recovery, she cried, `I will tell, I will tell.  
They brought me to it;' and then fell into a fit again,  
which fits continuing, she was ordered to be led out, and  
the next to be brought in, viz., Bridget Bishop.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Some time afterwards, she was called in again, but  
immediately taken with fits for a while.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;`Have you signed the Devil's book? &mdash; No.'</p>  
<pb n="119" id="vII119"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2124">  
<figDesc>Page 119.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>&ldquo;`Have you not touched it? &mdash; No.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Then she fell into fits again, and was sent forth for air.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;After a considerable space of time, she was brought in  
again, but could not give account of things by reason of fits,  
and so sent forth.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Mary Warren called in afterwards in private, before  
magistrates and ministers.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;She said, `I shall not speak a word: but I will, I will  
speak, Satan! She saith she will kill me. Oh! she saith  
she owes me a spite, and will claw me off. Avoid Satan,  
for the name of God, avoid!' and then fell into fits again,  
and cried, `Will ye? I will prevent ye, in the name of  
God.&rdquo;'</p></q>  
<p>The magistrate inquired earnestly: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;`Tell us how far have you yielded?'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;A fit interrupts her again.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;`What did they say you should do, and you should be  
well?'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Then her lips were bit, so that she could not speak:  
so she was sent away.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Mr. Parris, the reporter of the case, adds: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Note that not one of the sufferers was afflicted during  
her examination, after once she began to confess, though  
they were tormented before.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>She was subsequently examined in the prison  
several times, falling occasionally into fits, and exhibiting the appearance of a long-continued conflict  
with Satan, who was supposed to be resisting her  
inclination to confess, and holding her with violence  
<pb n="120" id="vII120"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2125">  
<figDesc>Page 120.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to the contract she had made with him. The magistrates and ministers beheld with amazement and awe  
what they believed to be precisely a similar scene to  
that described by the evangelists when the Devil strove  
against the power of the Saviour and his disciples,  
and would not quit his hold upon the young man,  
but &ldquo;threw him down, and tare him.&rdquo; At length, as  
in that case, Satan was overcome. After a protracted,  
most violent, and terrible contest, Mary Warren got  
released from his clutches, and made a full and circumstantial confession.</p>  
<p>Whoever studies carefully the account of Mary  
Warren's successive examinations can hardly question, I think, that she acted a part, and acted it with  
wonderful cunning, skill, and effect.</p>  
<p>This examination, beginning on Tuesday, the 19th  
of April, continued after she was committed to prison  
in Salem, at the jail there, for several days, and was  
renewed at intervals until the middle of May. After  
she had thoroughly broken away from Satan, she revealed all that she had seen and heard while associating with him and his confederate subjects: her  
testimony was implicitly received, and it dealt death  
and destruction in all directions. It is a circumstance  
strongly confirming this view, that Mary Warren was  
soon released from confinement. It was the general  
practice to keep those, who confessed, in prison, to retain  
in that way power over them, and prevent their recanting their confessions. She is found, by the papers  
on file, to have acted afterwards, as a capital witness,  
<pb n="121" id="vII121"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2126">  
<figDesc>Page 121.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
against ten persons, all of whom were convicted, and  
seven executed. Besides these, she testified, with the  
appearance of animosity and vindictiveness, against her  
master John Procter, and her mistress his wife; thus  
contributing to secure the conviction of both, and  
the death of the former. In how many more cases  
she figured in the same character and to the same  
effect is unknown, as the papers in reference to only  
a very small proportion of them have come down to  
us. The interpretation I give to the course of Mary  
Warren exhibits her guilt, and that of those participating in the stratagem, as of the deepest and blackest  
dye. But it seems to be the only one which a scrutiny  
of the details of her examinations, and of the facts of  
the case, allows us to receive. The effect was most  
decisive. The course of the accusing children in  
crying out against one of their own number satisfied  
the public, and convinced still more the magistrates,  
that they were truthful, honest, and upright. They  
had before given evidence that they paid no regard  
to family influence or eminent reputation. They had  
now proved that they had no partiality and no favoritism, but were equally ready to bring to light and to  
justice any of their own circle who might fall into  
the snare of the Evil One, and become confederate  
with him. No dramatic artist, no cunning impostor,  
ever contrived a more ingenious plot; and no actors  
ever carried one out better than Mary Warren and  
the afflicted children.</p>  
<p>Giles Corey incurred hostility, perhaps, because his  
<pb n="122" id="vII122"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2127">  
<figDesc>Page 122.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
deposition relating to his wife did not come up to the  
mark required. It is also highly probable, that, though  
incensed at her conduct at the time, reflection had  
brought him to his senses; and that the circumstances  
of her examination and commitment to prison produced  
a re-action in his mind. If so, he would have been  
apt to express himself very freely. His examination  
took place April 19th, in the meeting-house at the  
Village. The girls acted their usual part, charging  
him, one by one, with having afflicted them, and  
proving it on the spot by tortures and sufferings.  
After they had severally got through, they all joined  
at once in their demonstrations. The report made  
by Parris says, &ldquo;All the afflicted were seized now  
with fits, and troubled with pinches. Then the Court  
ordered his hands to be tied.&rdquo; The magistrates lost  
all control of themselves, and flew into a passion, exclaiming, &ldquo;What! is it not enough to act witchcraft  
at other times, but must you do it now, in face  
of authority?&rdquo; He seems to have been profoundly  
affected by the marvellousness of the accusations, and  
the exhibition of what to him was inexplicable in the  
sufferings of the girls; and all he could say was, &ldquo;I  
am a poor creature, and cannot help it.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Upon the  
motion of his head again, they had their heads and  
necks afflicted.&rdquo; The magistrates, not having recovered their composure, continued to pour their wrath  
upon him, &ldquo;Why do you tell such wicked lies against  
witnesses?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;One of his hands was let go, and  
several were afflicted. He held his head on one side,  
<pb n="123" id="vII123"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2128">  
<figDesc>Page 123.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and then the heads of several of the afflicted were  
held on one side. He drew in his cheeks, and the  
cheeks of some of the afflicted were sucked in.&rdquo; Goody  
Bibber was on hand, and played her accompaniment.  
She also uttered malignant charges against him, and  
&ldquo;was suddenly seized with a violent fit.&rdquo; One of  
 
Bibber's statements was that he had called her husband  
&ldquo;damned devilish rogue.&rdquo; Through all this outrage,  
Corey was firm in asserting his innocence. His language and manner were serious, and solemnized by  
a sense of the helplessness of his situation and the  
wicked falsehoods heaped upon him. His disagreement with his wife about the witchcraft proceedings  
being well known, the accusers endeavored to make  
it out that they had often quarrelled. But he insisted  
that the only difference which had before existed between them was a conflict of opinion on one point.  
In his family devotions, he used this expression, &ldquo;living to God and dying to sin.&rdquo; She &ldquo;found fault&rdquo; with  
the language, and criticised it. He thought it was all  
right! The characteristic spirit of the old man was  
roused most strikingly by one of the charges. Bibber and others testified that Corey had said he had  
seen the Devil in the shape of a black hog and  
was very much frightened. He could not stand  
under the imputation of cowardice, and lost sight of  
every other element in the accusation but that. The  
magistrate asked, &ldquo;What did you see in the cow? Why do you deny it?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I saw nothing  
but my cattle.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;(Divers witnessed that he told  
<pb n="124" id="vII124"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2129">  
<figDesc>Page 124.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
them he was frighted.)&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Well, what do you say  
to these witnesses? What was it frighted you?&rdquo; &mdash;  
&ldquo;I do not know that ever I spoke the word in my  
life.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>But while his character retained its manliness, and  
his soul was truly insensible to fear, he was very  
much oppressed and distressed by his situation. The  
share he had, with two of his sons-in-law, in bringing  
his wife into her awful condition, and in driving on  
the public infatuation at the beginning, was more than  
he could endure to think of, and he was charged with  
having meditated suicide. Perhaps he had already  
formed the purpose afterwards carried into effect, and  
may have dropped expressions, under that thought,  
which to others might appear to indicate a design of self. He was accused of having said that &ldquo;he  
would make away with himself, and charge his death  
upon his son.&rdquo; His sons-in-law, Crosby and Parker,  
were acting with the crowd that were pursuing him  
to his death. Little did it enter the imagination of  
any one then, that there was a method by which he  
could &ldquo;make away with himself,&rdquo; leaving the entire  
act of the destruction of his life upon his persecutors,  
and the sin to be apportioned between him and them  
by the All-wise and All-just.</p>  
<p>Abigail Hobbs had been a reckless vagrant creature,  
wandering through the woods at night like a half person; but she had wit enough to see that  
there was safety in confession. She pretended to  
have committed, by witchcraft, crimes enough to have  
<pb n="125" id="vII125"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2130">  
<figDesc>Page 125.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
hanged her a dozen times. If she had stood to her  
confession, we should have heard of her no more.</p>  
<p>Bridget Bishop's examination filled the intervals of  
time while Mary Warren was being carried out of the  
meeting-house to recover from her fits. Both Parris  
and Ezekiel Cheever took minutes of it, from which  
the substance is gathered as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<p>On her coming in, the afflicted persons, at the same  
moment, severally fell into fits, and were dreadfully  
tormented. Hathorne addressed her, calling upon her  
to give an account of the witchcrafts she was &ldquo;conversant in.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I take all this people to  
witness that I am clear.&rdquo; He then asked the children, &ldquo;Hath this woman hurt you?&rdquo; They all cried  
out that she had. The magistrate continued, &ldquo;You  
are here accused by four or five: what do you say to  
it?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I never saw these persons before, nor I  
never<note target="v2n1">*</note> was in this place before. I never did hurt  
them in my life.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>At a meeting of the afflicted children and others,  
some one declared that Bridget Bishop was present &ldquo;in  
her shape&rdquo; or apparition, and, pointing to a particular  
spot, said, &ldquo;There, there she is!&rdquo; Young Jonathan  
Walcot, exasperated by his sister's sufferings, struck at  
the spot with his sword; whereupon Mary cried out,  
&ldquo;You have hit her, you have torn her coat, and I heard  
it tear.&rdquo; This story had been brought to Hathorne's  
ears; and abruptly, as if to take her off her guard,  
<pb n="126" id="vII126"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2131">  
<figDesc>Page 126.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
he said, &ldquo;Is not your coat cut?&rdquo; She answered,  
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; They then examined the coat, and found what  
they regarded as having been &ldquo;cut or torn two ways.&rdquo;  
It was probably the fashion in which the garment was  
made; for she was in the habit of dressing more artistically than the women of the Village. At any rate,  
it did not appear like a direct cut of a sword; but  
Jonathan got over the difficulty by saying that &ldquo;the  
sword that he struck at Goody Bishop was not naked,  
but was within the scabbard.&rdquo; This explained the  
whole matter, so that Cheever says, in his report,  
that &ldquo;the rent may very probably be the very same  
that Mary Walcot did tell that she had in her coat,  
by Jonathan's striking at her appearance&rdquo;! Parris  
says, with more caution, more indeed than was usual  
with him, &ldquo;Upon some search in the Court, a rent,  
that seems to answer what was alleged, was found.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Hathorne, having heard the scandals they had circulated against her, proceeded: &ldquo;They say you bewitched your first husband to death.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;If it please  
Your Worship, I know nothing of it.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;What do  
you say of these murders you are charged with?&rdquo;  
&mdash; &ldquo;I hope I am not guilty of murder.&rdquo; As she said  
this, she turned up her eyes, probably to give solemnity to her declaration. At the opening of the examination, she looked round upon the people, and  
called them to witness her innocence. She had found  
out by this time, that no justice could be expected from  
them; and feeling, with Rebecca Nurse on a recent  
similar occasion, &ldquo;I have got nobody to look to but  
<pb n="127" id="vII127"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2132">  
<figDesc>Page 127.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
God,&rdquo; she turned her eyes heavenward. Instantly, the  
eyeballs of all the girls were rolled up in their sockets,  
and fixed. The effect was awful, and still more increased as they went, after a moment or two, into  
dreadful torments. Hathorne could no longer contain himself, but broke out, &ldquo;Do you not see how they  
are tormented? You are acting witchcraft before us!  
What do you say to this? Why have you not a heart  
to confess the truth?&rdquo; She calmly replied, &ldquo;I am  
innocent. I know nothing of it. I am no witch. I  
know not what a witch is.&rdquo; The &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo;  
charged her with having tried to persuade them to sign  
the Devil's book. As she had never before seen one of  
them, she was indignant at this barefaced falsehood,  
and, as Cheever says, &ldquo;shook her head&rdquo; in her resentment; which, as he further says, put them all into great  
torments. Parris represents that in every motion of  
her head they were tortured. Marshal Herrick, as  
usual, put in his oar, and volunteered charges against  
her. She bore herself well through the shocking scene,  
and did not shrink, at its close, from expressing her  
unbelief of the whole thing: &ldquo;I do not know whether  
there be any witches or no.&rdquo; When she was removed  
from the place of examination, the accusers all had  
fits, and broke forth in outcries of agony. After being  
taken out, one of the constables in charge of her asked  
her if she was not troubled to see the afflicted persons so tormented; and she replied, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; In answer  
to further questions, she indicated that she could not  
<pb n="128" id="vII128"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2133">  
<figDesc>Page 128.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
tell what to think of them, and did not concern herself about them at all.</p>  
<p>Giles Corey, Bridget Bishop, Abigail Hobbs, together  
with Mary Warren, were duly committed to prison.</p>  
<p>Two days after, April 21, warrants were issued  
&ldquo;against William Hobbs, husbandman, and Deliverance his wife; Nehemiah Abbot, Jr., weaver; Mary  
Easty, the wife of Isaac Easty; and Sarah Wilds, the  
wife of John Wilds, &mdash; all of the town of Topsfield, or  
Ipswich; and Edward Bishop, husbandman, and Sarah  
his wife, of Salem Village; and Mary Black, a negro of  
Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam's, of Salem Village also;  
and Mary English, the wife of Philip English, merchant  
in Salem.&rdquo; All of them were to be delivered to the  
magistrates for examination at the house of Lieutenant Nathaniel Ingersoll, at about ten o'clock the  
next morning, in Salem Village; and were brought  
in accordingly.</p>  
<p>What the papers on file enable us to glean of these  
nine persons is substantially as follows: William  
Hobbs was about fifty years of age, and one of the  
earliest settlers of the Village, although his residence was on the territory afterwards included in  
Topsfield. His daughter Abigail, of whom I have  
just spoken, appears from all the accounts to have  
acted at this stage of the transaction a most wicked  
part, ready to do all the mischief in her power, and  
allowing herself to be used to any extent to fasten  
the imputation of witchcraft upon others. Several  
persons testified that, long before, she had boasted that  
<pb n="129" id="vII129"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2134">  
<figDesc>Page 129.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
she was not afraid of any thing, &ldquo;for she had sold  
herself body and soul to the Old Boy;&rdquo; one witness  
testified, that, &ldquo;some time last winter, I was discoursing with Abigail Hobbs about her wicked carriages and disobedience to her father and mother,  
and she told me she did not care what anybody said to  
her, for she had seen the Devil, and had made a covenant or bargain with him;&rdquo; another, Margaret Knight,  
testified, that, about a year before, &ldquo;Abigail Hobbs  
and her mother were at my father's house, and Abigail Hobbs said to me, `Margaret, are you baptized?'  
And I said, `Yes.' Then said she, `My mother is  
not baptized, but I will baptize her;' and immediately  
took water, and sprinkled in her mother's face, and  
said she did baptize her `in the name of the Father,  
Son, and Holy Ghost.&rdquo;'</p>  
<p>She was arrested, and brought to the Village, on the  
19th of April. The next day, she began her operations by declaring that &ldquo;Judah White, a Jersey maid&rdquo;  
that lived with Joseph Ingersoll at Casco, &ldquo;but now  
lives at Boston,&rdquo; appeared to her &ldquo;in apparition&rdquo; the  
day before, and advised her to &ldquo;fly, and not to go to  
be examined,&rdquo; but, if she did go, &ldquo;not to confess any  
thing:&rdquo; she described the dress of this &ldquo;apparition,&rdquo;  
&mdash; she &ldquo;came to her in fine clothes, in a sad-colored  
silk mantle, with a top-knot and a hood.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;She confesseth further, that the Devil in the shape of a man  
came to her,&rdquo; and charged her to afflict the girls;  
bringing images made of wood in their likeness with  
thorns for her to prick into the images, which she  
<pb n="130" id="vII130"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2135">  
<figDesc>Page 130.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
did: whereupon the girls cried out that they were hurt  
by her. She further confessed, that, &ldquo;she was at the  
great meeting in Mr. Parris's pasture, when they administered the sacrament, and did eat of the red bread  
and drink of the red wine, at the same time.&rdquo; This  
confession established her credibility at once; and,  
the next day, the warrants were issued for the nine  
persons above mentioned, against whom they had  
secured in her an effective witness. She had resided  
for some time at Casco Bay; and we shall soon see  
how matters began in a few days to work in that direction. There are two indictments against this Abigail  
Hobbs: one charging her with having made a covenant with &ldquo;the Evil Spirit, the Devil,&rdquo; at Casco Bay,  
in 1688; the other with having exercised the arts o  
witchcraft upon the afflicted girls, at Salem Village,  
in 1692.</p>  
<p>When her unhappy father was brought to examination, he found that his daughter was playing into the  
hands of the accusers; and that his wife, overwhelmed  
by the horrors of the situation, although for a time  
protesting her innocence and lamenting that she had  
been the mother of such a daughter, had broken  
down and confessed, saying whatever might be put  
in her mouth by the magistrates, the girls, or the  
crowd. Under these circumstances, he was brought  
forward for examination. Parris took minutes of it.  
It is to be regretted, that the paper is much dilapidated,  
and portions of the lines wholly lost. What is left  
shows that the mind of William Hobbs rose superior  
<pb n="131" id="vII131"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2136">  
<figDesc>Page 131.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to the terrors and powers arrayed against it. The  
magistrate commenced proceedings by inquiring of the  
girls, pointing to the prisoner, &ldquo;Hath this man hurt  
you?&rdquo; Several of them answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Goody  
Bibber, who seems generally to have been a very  
zealous volunteer backer of the girls, on this occasion,  
for a wonder, answered &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The magistrate, addressing the prisoner, &ldquo;What say you? Are you  
guilty or not?&rdquo; &mdash; Answer: &ldquo;I can speak in the presence of God safely, as I must look to give account  
another day, that I am as clear as a new-born babe?&rdquo;  
&mdash; &ldquo;Clear of what?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Of witchcraft.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Have  
you never hurt these?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Abigail Williams  
cried out that he &ldquo;was going to Mercy Lewis!&rdquo;  
Whereupon Mercy was seized with a fit. Then Abigail  
cried out again, &ldquo;He is coming to Mary Walcot!&rdquo;  
and Mary went into her fit. The magistrate, in consternation, appealed to him: &ldquo;How can you be clear,&rdquo;  
when your appearance is thus seen producing such  
effects before our eyes? Then the children went  
into fits all together, and &ldquo;hallooed&rdquo; at the top  
of their voices, and &ldquo;shouted greatly.&rdquo; The magistrate then brought up the confession of his wife  
against him, and expostulated with him for not confessing; the afflicted, in the mean while, bringing the  
whole machinery of their convulsions, shrieks, and  
uproar to bear against him: but he calmly, and in  
brief terms, denied it.</p>  
<p>The circle of accusing girls seems to have been a  
receptacle, into which all the scandal, gossip, and  
<pb n="132" id="vII132"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2137">  
<figDesc>Page 132.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
defamation of the surrounding country was emptied.  
Some one had told them that William Hobbs was not  
a regular attendant at meeting. They passed it on to  
the magistrate, and he put this question to the accused:  
&ldquo;When were you at any public religious meeting?&rdquo;  
He replied, &ldquo;Not a pretty while.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;  
&mdash; &ldquo;Because I was not well: I had a distemper that  
none knows.&rdquo; The magistrate said, &ldquo;Can you act  
witchcraft here, and, by casting your eyes, turn folks  
into fits?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;You may judge your pleasure. My  
soul is clear.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Do you not see you hurt these by  
your look?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;No: I do not know it.&rdquo; After  
another display of awful sufferings, caused, as they  
protested, by the mere look of Hobbs, the magistrate,  
with triumphant confidence, again put it home to him,  
&ldquo;Can you now deny it?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I can  
deny it to my dying day.&rdquo; The magistrate inquired  
of him for what reason he withdrew from the room  
whenever the Scriptures were read in his family. He  
plumply denied it. Nathaniel Ingersoll and Thomas  
Haynes testified that his daughter had told them  
so. The confessions of his wife and daughter were  
over and over again brought up against him, but to  
no effect. &ldquo;Who do you worship?&rdquo; said the magistrate. &ldquo;I hope I worship God only.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  
&mdash; &ldquo;In my heart.&rdquo; The examination failed to confound or embarrass him in the least. He could not  
be drawn into the expression of any of the feelings  
which the conduct of his graceless and depraved  
daughter or his weak and wretched wife must have  
<pb n="133" id="vII133"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2138">  
<figDesc>Page 133.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
excited. He quietly protested that he knew nothing  
about witchcraft; and, towards the close, with solemn  
earnestness of utterance, declared that his innocence  
was known to the &ldquo;great God in heaven.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>He was committed for trial. All that the documents in existence inform us further, in relation to  
William Hobbs, is that he remained in prison until  
the 14th of the next December, when two of his neighbors, John Nichols and Joseph Towne, in some way  
succeeded in getting him bailed out; they giving bonds  
in the sum of two hundred pounds for his appearance at the sessions of the Court the next month.  
But it was not, even then, thought wholly safe to  
have him come in; and the fine was incurred. He  
appeared at the term in May, the fine was remitted,  
and he discharged by proclamation. On the 26th of  
March, 1714, he gave evidence in a case of commonage rights. He was then seventy-two years of age.  
Of his wife and daughter, I shall again have occasion  
to speak.</p>  
<p>For all that is known of the case of Nehemiah  
Abbot, we are indebted to Hutchinson, who had  
Parris's minutes of the examination before him.  
Hutchinson says, that, of &ldquo;near an hundred&rdquo; whose  
examinations he had seen, he was the only one who,  
having been brought before the magistrates, was finally  
dismissed by them. Perhaps even this case was not  
an exception: for a document on file shows that a  
person named Abbot of the same locality was subsequently arrested and imprisoned; but unfortunately  
<pb n="134" id="vII134"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2139">  
<figDesc>Page 134.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the Christian name has been obliterated, or from  
some cause is wanting. It seems, from Hutchinson's  
minutes, that he protested his innocence in manly  
and firm declarations. Mary Walcot testified that she  
had seen his shape. Ann Putnam cried out that she  
saw him &ldquo;upon the beam.&rdquo; The magistrates told  
him that his guilt was certainly proved, and that, if  
he would find mercy of God, he must confess. &ldquo;I  
speak before God,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that I am clear  
from this accusation.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;What, in all respects?&rdquo;  
&mdash; &ldquo;Yes, in all respects.&rdquo; The girls were struck  
with dumbness; and Ann Putnam, re-affirming that  
he was the man that hurt her, &ldquo;was taken with a  
fit.&rdquo; Mary Walcot began to waver in her confidence,  
and Mercy Lewis said, &ldquo;It is not the man.&rdquo; This  
unprecedented variance in the testimony of the girls  
brought matters to a stand; and he was sent out for  
a time, while others were examined: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;When he was brought in again, by reason of much  
people, and many in the windows, so that the accusers  
could not have a clear view of him, he was ordered to be  
abroad, and the accusers to go forth to him, and view him  
in the light, which they did in the presence of the magistrates and many others, discoursed quietly with him, one  
and all acquitting him; but yet said he was like that man,  
but he had not the wen they saw in his apparition. Note,  
he was a hilly-faced man, and stood shaded by reason of his  
own hair; so that for a time he seemed to some bystanders  
and observers to be considerably like the person the afflicted  
did describe.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<pb n="135" id="vII135"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2140">  
<figDesc>Page 135.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>Such is Parris's statement, as quoted by Hutchinson. What was the real cause or motive of this discrepancy among the witnesses does not appear. The  
facts, that at first they went into fits in beholding him,  
were all struck dumb for a while, and Ann Putnam saw him on the beam, were likely to have an  
unfavorable effect upon the minds of the people, and  
threatened to explode the delusion. But Ann, with  
a quickness of wit that never failed to meet any emergency, when Mercy Lewis said it was not the man,  
cried out in a fit, &ldquo;Did you put a mist before my  
eyes?&rdquo; She conveyed the idea that the power of  
Satan blinded her, and caused her to mistake the  
man. This answered the purpose; and, although Abbot  
got clear, for the time at least, all were more than  
ever convinced that the Evil One, in misleading Ann,  
had shown his hand on the occasion.</p>  
<p>The examination of Sarah Wildes had no peculiar  
features. The afflicted children and Goody Bibber  
saw her apparition sitting on the beam while she  
was bodily present at the bar, and went through their  
usual fits and evolutions. She maintained her innocence with dignity and firmness; and the magistrate,  
prejudging the case against her, rebuked her obstinacy in not confessing, in his accustomed manner.</p>  
<p>No account has come down of the examinations of  
Edward Bishop, or Sarah his wife. He was the third  
of that name, probably the son of the &ldquo;Sawyer.&rdquo;  
His wife Sarah was a daughter of William Wildes  
of Ipswich, and, it would seem, a sister of John  
<pb n="136" id="vII136"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2141">  
<figDesc>Page 136.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Wildes, the examination of whose wife has just been  
mentioned. Some of the evidence indicates that she  
was a niece of Rebecca Nurse. They all belonged  
to that class of persons who, under the general appellation of &ldquo;the Topsfield men,&rdquo; had been in such frequent  
collision with the people of the Village. Edward  
Bishop was forty-four years of age, and his wife forty. They had a family, at the time of their imprisonment, of twelve children. Sarah Bishop had been  
dismissed from the church at the Village, and recommended to that at Topsfield, May 25, 1690. They  
had land in Topsfield, as well as in the Village, and  
were more intimately connected in social relations with  
the former than the latter place. They effected their  
escape from prison, and survived the storm. Mary,  
the wife of Philip English, was committed to prison.  
We have no record of her examination.</p>  
<p>Mary Black, the negro woman, belonged to Nathaniel Putnam, but lived in the family of his son  
Benjamin. Her examination shows that she was an  
ignorant but an innocent person. She knew nothing  
about the matter, and had no idea what it all meant.  
To the questions with which the magistrate pressed  
her, her answers were, &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot  
tell.&rdquo; The only fact brought out against her besides  
the actings of the girls was this: &ldquo;Her master saith  
a man sat down upon the form with her about a  
twelvemonth ago.&rdquo; Parris, in his minutes, gives this  
piece of evidence, but does not enlighten us as to its  
import. The magistrate asked her, &ldquo;What did the man  
<pb n="137" id="vII137"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2142">  
<figDesc>Page 137.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
say to you?&rdquo; Her answer was: &ldquo;He said nothing.&rdquo;  
This is all they got out of her; and it is all the light  
we have on the mysterious fact, that a man was once  
seated, at some time within twelve months, on the  
same form or bench with poor Mary Black. The  
magistrate asked the girls, &ldquo;Doth this negro hurt  
you?&rdquo; They said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Why do you hurt  
them?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I did not hurt them.&rdquo; This question was  
put to her, &ldquo;Do you prick sticks?&rdquo; perhaps the  
meaning was, Do you prick the afflicted children  
with sticks? The simple creature evidently did not  
know what they were driving at, and answered, &ldquo;No:  
I pin my neckcloth.&rdquo; The examiner asked her,  
&ldquo;Will you take out the pin, and pin it again?&rdquo; She  
did so, and several of the afflicted cried out that they  
were pricked. Mary Walcot was pricked in the arm  
till the blood came, Abigail Williams was pricked  
in the stomach, and Mercy Lewis was pricked in the  
foot. It is probable, that, in this case, the girls, as  
they often appear to have done, provided themselves  
by concert beforehand with pins ready to be stuck  
into the assigned parts of their bodies, and managed  
to get the queer and unusual question put. The  
whole thing has the appearance of being pre-arranged;  
and it answered the purpose, filling the crowd with  
amazement, and excluding all possible doubt from the  
minds of the magistrates. Mary was committed to  
prison, where she remained until discharged, in May,  
1693, by proclamation from the governor.</p>  
<p>Mary Easty, wife of Isaac Easty, and sister of Rebecca  
<pb n="138" id="vII138"/>

<figDesc>Page 138.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Nurse and Sarah Cloyse, was about fifty-eight  
years of age, and the mother of seven children. Her  
husband owned and lived upon a large and valuable  
farm, which not many years since was the property  
and country residence of the late Hon. B. W. Crowninshield, and is now in the possession of Thomas  
Pierce, Esq. Her examination was accompanied by  
the usual circumstances. The girls had fits, and were  
speechless at times: the magistrate expostulated with  
her for not confessing her guilt, which he regarded  
as demonstrated, beyond a question, by the sufferings  
of the afflicted. &ldquo;Would you have me accuse myself?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;How far,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;have you complied with Satan?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Sir, I never complied, but  
prayed against him all my days. What would you  
have me do?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Confess, if you be guilty.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I  
will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of  
this sin.&rdquo; The magistrate, apparently affected by her  
manner and bearing, inquired of the girls, &ldquo;Are you  
certain this is the woman?&rdquo; They all went into fits;  
and presently Ann Putnam, coming to herself, said  
&ldquo;that was the woman, it was like her, and she told me  
her name.&rdquo; The accused clasped her hands together,  
and Mercy Lewis's hands were clenched; she separated her hands, and Mercy's were released; she inclined her head, and the girls screamed out, &ldquo;Put up  
her head; for, while her head is bowed, the necks of  
these are broken.&rdquo; The magistrate again asked, &ldquo;Is  
this the woman?&rdquo; They made signs that they could  
not speak; but afterwards Ann Putnam and others  
<pb n="139" id="vII139"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2144">  
<figDesc>Page 139.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
cried out: &ldquo;O Goody Easty, Goody Easty, you are  
the woman, you are the woman!&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;What do you  
say to this?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Why, God will know.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Nay, God  
knows now.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I know he does.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;What did you  
think of the actions of others before your sisters came  
out? did you think it was witchcraft?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I cannot  
tell.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Why do you not think it is witchcraft?&rdquo;  
&mdash; &ldquo;It is an evil spirit; but whether it be witchcraft  
I do not know.&rdquo; She was committed to prison.</p>  
<p>It will be noticed that seven out of the nine examined at this time either lived in Topsfield or were  
intimately connected with the church and people there.  
The accusing girls had heard them angrily spoken of  
by the people around them, and availed themselves,  
as at all times, of existing prejudices, to guide them  
in the selection of their victim.</p>  
<p>The escape of Abbot, and the wavering, in his case  
and that of Easty, indicated by the magistrates on this  
occasion, alarmed the prosecutors; and they felt that  
something must be done to stiffen Hathorne and Corwin to their previous rigid method of procedure. The  
following letter was accordingly written to them that  
very day, immediately after the close of the examinations: &mdash;</p>

<p>What was meant by the &ldquo;wheel within a wheel,&rdquo;  
the &ldquo;high and dreadful&rdquo; things which were making  
their ears to tingle, but had not yet been disclosed  
to the magistrates, we shall presently see. On the  
30th of April, Captain Jonathan Walcot and Sergeant  
Thomas Putnam (the writer of the foregoing letter)  
got out a warrant against Philip English, of Salem,  
merchant; Sarah Morrel, of Beverly; and Dorcas  
Hoar, of the same place, widow. Morrel and Hoar  
were delivered by Marshal Herrick, according to the  
tenor of the warrant, at 11, A.M., May 2, at the house  
of Lieutenant Nathaniel Ingersoll, in Salem Village.  
The warrant has an indorsement in these words:  
&ldquo;Mr. Philip English not being to be found. G. H.&rdquo;  
As the records of the examinations of Philip English  
<pb n="141" id="vII141"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2146">  
<figDesc>Page 141.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and his wife have not been preserved, and only a few  
fragments of the testimony relating to their case are  
to be found, all that can be said is that the girls and  
their accomplices made their usual charges against  
them. There are two depositions in existence, however, which afford some explanation of the causes that  
exposed Mr. English to hostility, and indicate the kind  
of evidence that was brought against him. Having  
many landed estates, in various places, and extensive  
business transactions, he was liable to frequent questions of litigation. He was involved, at one time, in  
a lawsuit about the bounds of a piece of land in  
Marblehead. A person named William Beale, of that  
town, had taken great interest in it adversely to the  
claims of English; and some harsh words passed  
between them. A year or two after the affair, Beale  
states, &ldquo;that, as I lay in my bed, in the morning, presently after it was fair light abroad in the room,&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I saw a dark shade,&rdquo; &amp;c. To his vision it soon  
assumed the shape of Philip English. On a previous occasion, when riding through Lynn to get testimony against English in the aforesaid boundary case,  
he says, &ldquo;My nose gushed out bleeding in a most  
extraordinary manner, so that it bloodied a handkerchief of considerable bigness, and also ran down  
upon my clothes and upon my horse's mane.&rdquo; He  
charged it upon English. These depositions were  
sworn to in Court, in August, 1692, and January,  
1693. How they got there does not appear, as English  
was never brought to trial. All that relates to Mr.  
<pb n="142" id="vII142"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2147">  
<figDesc>Page 142.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
English and his wife may be despatched at this point.  
On the 6th of May, a warrant was procured at Boston,  
&ldquo;To the marshal-general, or his lawful deputy,&rdquo; to  
apprehend Philip English wherever found within the  
jurisdiction, and convey him to the &ldquo;custody of the  
marshal of Essex.&rdquo; Jacob Manning, a deputy, delivered him to the marshal of Essex on the  
30th of May; and he was brought before the magistrates on the next day, and, after examination, committed to prison. He and his wife effected their  
escape from jail, and found refuge in New York  
until the proceedings were terminated, when they  
returned to Salem, and continued to reside here.  
She survived the shock given by the accusation, the  
danger to which she had been exposed, and the sufferings of imprisonment, but a short time. They occupied the highest social position. He was a merchant,  
conducting an extensive business, and had a large  
estate; owning fourteen buildings in the town, a  
wharf, and twenty-one sail of vessels. His dwellinghouse, represented in the frontispiece of this volume,  
stood until a recent period, and is remembered by many  
of us. Its site was on the southern side of Essex  
Street, near its termination; comprising the area between English and Webb Streets. It must have been  
a beautiful situation; commanding at that time a  
full, unobstructed view of the Beverly and Marblehead  
shores, and all the waters and points of land between  
them. The mansion was spacious in its dimensions,  
and bore the marks of having been constructed in the  
<pb n="143" id="vII143"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2148">  
<figDesc>Page 143.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
best style of elegance, strength, and finish. It was  
indeed a curious and venerable specimen of the domestic architecture of its day. A first-class house  
then; in its proportions, arrangements, and attachments, it would compare well with first-class houses  
now. Mrs. English was a lady of eminent character  
and culture. Traditions to this effect have come down  
with singular uniformity through all the old families  
of the place. She was the only child of Richard  
Hollingsworth, and inherited his large property. The  
Rev. William Bentley, D.D., in his &ldquo;Description of  
Salem,&rdquo; and whose daily life made him conversant  
with all that relates to the locality of Mrs. English's  
residence, says that the officer came to apprehend  
her in the evening, after she had retired to rest. He  
was admitted by the servants, and read his warrant  
in her bedchamber. Guards were placed around the  
house. To be accused by the afflicted children was  
then regarded as certain death. &ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo;  
says Bentley, &ldquo;she attended the devotions of her  
family, kissed her children with great composure,  
proposed her plan for their education, took leave of  
them, and then told the officer she was ready to die.&rdquo;  
Dr. Bentley suggests that unfriendly feelings may  
have existed against Mr. English in consequence of  
some controversies he had been engaged in with the  
town about the title to lands; that the superior  
style in which his family lived had subjected them  
to vulgar prejudice; that the existence of this feeling becoming known to the &ldquo;afflicted girls&rdquo; led them  
<pb n="144" id="vII144"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2149">  
<figDesc>Page 144.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to cry out against him and his wife. It may be so.  
They availed themselves of every such advantage;  
and particularly liked to strike high, so as the more  
to astound and overawe the public mind.</p>  
<p>I find no further mention of Sarah Morrel. She  
doubtless shared the fate of those escaping death, &mdash; a  
long imprisonment. When Dorcas Hoar was brought  
in, there was a general commotion among the afflicted,  
falling into fits all around. After coming out of them,  
they vied with each other in heaping all sorts of accusations upon the prisoner; Abigail Williams and  
Ann Putnam charging her with having choked a  
woman in Boston; Elizabeth Hubbard crying out that  
she was pinching her, &ldquo;and showing the marks to  
the standers by. The marshal said she pinched her  
fingers at the time.&rdquo; The magistrate, indignantly  
believing the whole, said, &ldquo;Dorcas Hoar, why do you  
hurt these?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I never hurt any child in my life.&rdquo;  
The girls then charged her with having killed her husband, and with various other crimes. Mary Walcot,  
Susanna Sheldon, and Abigail Williams said they  
saw a black man whispering in her ear. The spirit  
of the prisoner was raised; and she said, &ldquo;Oh, you  
are liars, and God will stop the mouth of liars!&rdquo; The  
anger of the magistrates was roused by this bold outbreak. &ldquo;You are not to speak after this manner in  
the Court.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I will speak the truth as long as I  
live,&rdquo; she fearlessly replied. Parris says, at the close  
of his account, &ldquo;The afflicted were much distressed  
<pb n="145" id="vII145"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2150">  
<figDesc>Page 145.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
during her examination.&rdquo; Of course, she was sent to  
prison.</p>  
<p>Susanna Martin of Amesbury, a widow, was arrested  
on a warrant dated April 30, and examined at the  
Village church May 2. She is described as a short  
active woman, wearing a hood and scarf, plump and  
well developed in her figure, of remarkable personal  
neatness. One of the items of the evidence against  
her was, that, &ldquo;in an extraordinary dirty season, when  
it was not fit for any person to travel, she came on  
foot&rdquo; to a house at Newbury. The woman of the  
house, the substance of whose testimony I am giving,  
having asked, &ldquo;whether she came from Amesbury  
afoot,&rdquo; expressed her surprise at her having ventured  
abroad in such bad walking, and bid her children make  
way for her to come to the fire to dry herself. She  
replied &ldquo;she was as dry as I was,&rdquo; and turned her  
coats aside; &ldquo;and I could not perceive that the soles  
of her shoes were wet. I was startled at it, that she  
should come so dry; and told her that I should have  
been wet up to my knees, if I should have come so  
far on foot.&rdquo; She replied that &ldquo;she scorned to have a  
drabbled tail.&rdquo; The good woman who treated Susanna  
Martin on this occasion with such hospitable kindness received the impression, as appears by the import  
of her deposition, that, because Martin came into the  
house so wonderfully dry, she was therefore a witch.  
The only inference we are likely to draw is, that she  
was a particularly neat person; careful to pick her  
<pb n="146" id="vII146"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2151">  
<figDesc>Page 146.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
way; and did not wear skirts of the dimensions of  
our times.</p>  
<p>The language reported by this witness to have been  
used by Susanna Martin created in her, at the time,  
visible mortification, as well as resentment. A writer  
at the period, not by any means inclined to give a representation favorable to the prisoners, reports her expression thus: &ldquo;She scorned to be drabbled.&rdquo; She  
was undoubtedly a woman who spoke her mind freely,  
and with strength of expression, as the magistrates  
found. From this cause, perhaps, she had shocked  
the prejudices and violated the conventional scrupulosities then prevalent, to such a degree as to incur  
much comment, if not scandal. There had been a  
good deal of gossip about her; and, some time before,  
she had been proceeded against as a witch. But there  
was no ground for any serious charges against her  
character. Like Mrs. Ann Hibbens, perhaps the head  
and front of her offending was that she had more  
wit than her neighbors. She certainly was a strongminded woman, as her examination shows. Two reports of it, each in the handwriting of Parris, have  
come down to us. They are almost identical, and in  
substance as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<p>On the appearance of the accused, many of the witnesses against her instantly fell into fits. The magistrate inquired of them, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Hath this woman hurt you?&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Abigail Williams declared that she had hurt her  
<pb n="147" id="vII147"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2152">  
<figDesc>Page 147.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
often. `Ann Putnam threw her glove at her in a fit,' and  
the rest were struck dumb at her presence.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What! do you laugh at it? said the magistrate. &mdash; Well  
I may at such folly.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Is this folly to see these so hurt? &mdash; I never hurt man,  
woman, or child.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;(Mercy Lewis cried out, `She hath hurt me a great  
many times, and plucks me down.' Then Martin laughed  
again. Several others cried out upon her, and the magistrate again addressed her.)</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to this? &mdash; I have no hand in  
witchcraft.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did you do? did you consent these should be  
hurt? &mdash; No, never in my life.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What ails these people? &mdash; I do not know.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;But what do you think ails them? &mdash; I do not desire  
to spend my judgment upon it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they are bewitched? &mdash; No: I do not think  
they are.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell us your thoughts about them. &mdash; My thoughts  
are mine own when they are in; but, when they are out, they  
are another's.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think is their master? &mdash; If they be dealing in the black art, you may know as well as I.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What have you done towards the hurt of these? &mdash; I  
have done nothing.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is you, or your appearance. &mdash; I cannot help it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How comes your appearance just now to hurt these?  
&mdash; How do I know?</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Are you not willing to tell the truth? &mdash; I cannot tell.  
He that appeared in Samuel's shape can appear in any one's  
shape.</p>

</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe these afflicted persons do not say true?  
&mdash; They may lie, for aught I know.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;May not you lie? &mdash; I dare not tell a lie, if it would  
save my life.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>At this point, the marshal declared that &ldquo;she  
pinched her hands, and Elizabeth Hubbard was immediately afflicted. Several of the afflicted cried out  
that they saw her upon the beam&rdquo; of the meeting over their heads; and there was, no doubt, a  
scene of frightful excitement. The magistrate, in  
the depth of his awe and distress, earnestly appealed  
to the accused, &ldquo;Pray God discover you, if you  
be guilty.&rdquo; Nothing daunted, she replied, &ldquo;Amen,  
amen. A false tongue will never make a guilty  
person.&rdquo; A great uproar then arose. The accusers  
fell into dreadful convulsions, among the rest John  
Indian, who cried out, &ldquo;She bites, she bites!&rdquo; The  
magistrate, overcome by the sight of these sufferings, again appealed to her, &ldquo;Have not you compassion for these afflicted?&rdquo; She calmly and firmly  
answered, &ldquo;No: I have none.&rdquo; The uproar rose  
higher. The accusers all declared that they saw  
the &ldquo;black man,&rdquo; Satan himself, standing by her  
side. They pretended to try to approach her, but  
were suddenly deprived of the power of locomotion.  
John Indian attempted to rush upon her, but fell  
sprawling upon the floor. The magistrate again appealed to her: &ldquo;What is the reason these cannot  
come near you?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I cannot tell. It may be the  
Devil bears me more malice than another.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Do

you not see God evidently discovering you?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;No,  
not a bit for that.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;All the congregation besides  
think so.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Let them think what they will.&rdquo; &mdash;  
&ldquo;What is the reason these cannot come to you?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I  
do not know but they can, if they will; or else, if you  
please, I will come to them.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;What was that the  
black man whispered to you?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;There was none  
whispered to me.&rdquo; She was committed to prison.</p>

<p>In the mean while, preparations had been going on  
to bring upon the stage a more striking character,  
and give to the excited public mind a greater shock  
than had yet been experienced. Intimations had been  
thrown out that higher culprits than had been so far  
brought to light were in reserve, and would, in due  
time, be unmasked. It was hinted that a minister  
had joined the standard of the Arch-enemy, and was  
leading the devilish confederacy. In the accounts  
given of the diabolical sacraments, a man in black  
had been described, but no name yet given. As  
Charles the Second, while they were hanging the regicides, at the Restoration, was looking about for a  
preacher to hang, and used Hugh Peters for the  
occasion; so the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; or those acting  
behind them, wanted a minister to complete the <hi rend="italics">dramatis person&oelig;</hi> of their tragedy. His connection with  
the society and its controversies, and the animosities  
which had thus become attached to him, naturally  
suggested Mr. Burroughs. He was then pursuing,  
as usual, a laborious, humble, self-sacrificing ministry, in the midst of perils and privations, away

down in the frontier settlements on the coast of  
Maine, and little dreamed of what was brewing, for  
his ruin and destruction, in his former parish at the  
village. This is what Thomas Putnam had in his  
mind when he spoke of a &ldquo;wheel within a wheel,&rdquo;  
and &ldquo;the high and dreadful&rdquo; things not then disclosed that were to make &ldquo;ears tingle.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>It was necessary to be at once cautious and rapid  
in their movements, to prevent the public from getting  
information which, by reaching the ears of Burroughs,  
might put him on his guard. It was no easy thing  
to secure him at the great distance of his place of residence. If he should become apprised of what was going  
on, his escape into remoter and inaccessible settlements  
would have baffled the whole scheme. Nothing therefore was done at the village, but the steps to arrest him  
originated at Boston. Elisha Hutchinson, a magistrate there, issued the proper order, addressed to  
John Partridge of Portsmouth, Field-marshal of the  
provinces of New Hampshire and Maine, dated April  
30, 1692, to arrest George Burroughs, &ldquo;preacher at  
Wells;&rdquo; he being &ldquo;suspected of a confederacy with the  
Devil.&rdquo; Partridge was directed to deliver him to the  
custody of the marshal of Essex, or, not meeting him,  
was requested to bring him to Salem, and hand him  
over to the magistrates there. The &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; had begun, shortly before, to use his name.  
Abigail Hobbs had resided some years before at  
Casco; and from her they obtained all the scandal  
she had heard there, or chose to fabricate to suit the  
<pb n="151" id="vII151"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2156">  
<figDesc>Page 151.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
purpose of the prosecutors. The way in which the  
minds of the deluded people were worked up against  
Mr. Burroughs is illustrated in a deposition subsequently made to this effect: &mdash;</p>  
<p>Benjamin Hutchinson testified, that, on the 21st of  
April, 1692, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Abigail Williams told him that she saw a person whom  
she described as Mr. George Burroughs, &ldquo;a little black  
minister that lived at Casco Bay.&rdquo; Mr. Burroughs  
was of small stature and dark complexion. She gave  
an account of his wonderful feats of strength, said  
that he was a wizard; and that he &ldquo;had killed three  
wives, two for himself and one for Mr. Lawson.&rdquo; She  
affirmed that she saw him then. Mr. Burroughs, it  
will be borne in mind, was at this time a hundred  
miles away, at his home in Maine. Hutchinson  
asked her where she saw him. She said &ldquo;There,&rdquo;  
pointing to a rut in the road made by a cart-wheel.  
He had an iron fork in his hand, and threw it where  
she said Burroughs was standing. Instantly she fell  
into a fit; and, when she came out of it, said, &ldquo;`You  
have torn his coat, for I heard it tear.' &mdash; `Whereabouts?' said I. `On one side,' said she. Then we  
came into the house of Lieutenant Ingersoll; and I  
went into the great room, and Abigail came in and  
said, `There he stands.' I said, `Where? where?' and  
presently drew my rapier.&rdquo; Then Abigail said, he has  
gone, but &ldquo;`there is a gray cat.' Then I said, `Whereabouts?' `There!' said she, `there!' Then I struck  
with my rapier, and she fell into a fit; and, when it  
<pb n="152" id="vII152"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2157">  
<figDesc>Page 152.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
was over, she said, `You killed her.&rdquo;' Poor Hutchinson could not see the cat he had killed any more  
than Burroughs's coat he had torn. Abigail explained the mystery to his satisfaction, by saying that  
the spectre of Sarah Good had come in at the moment,  
and carried away the dead cat. This was all in broad  
daylight; it being, as Hutchinson testified, &ldquo;about  
twelve o'clock.&rdquo; The same day, &ldquo;after lecture, in said  
Ingersoll's chamber,&rdquo; Abigail Williams and Mary  
Walcot were present. They said that &ldquo;Goody Hobbs,  
of Topsfield, had bit Mary Walcot by the foot.&rdquo; Then  
both fell into a fit; and on coming out, &ldquo;they saw  
William Hobbs and his wife go both of them along  
the table.&rdquo; Hutchinson instantly stabbed, with his  
rapier, &ldquo;Goody Hobbs on her side,&rdquo; as the two girls  
declared. They further said that the room was &ldquo;full  
of them,&rdquo; that is of witches, in their apparitions; then  
Hutchinson and Eleazer Putnam &ldquo;stabbed with their  
rapiers at a venture.&rdquo; The girls cried out, that they  
&ldquo;had killed a great black woman of Stonington, and  
an Indian who had come with her:&rdquo; the girls said  
further, &ldquo;The floor is all covered with blood;&rdquo; and,  
rushing to the window, declared that they saw a great  
company of witches on a hill, and that three of them  
&ldquo;lay dead&rdquo; there, &mdash; &ldquo;the black woman, the Indian,  
and one more that they knew not.&rdquo; This was about  
four o'clock in the afternoon. This evidence was given  
and received in court. It shows the audacity with  
which the girls imposed upon the credulity of a people  
wrought up by their arts to the highest pitch of insane  
<pb n="153" id="vII153"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2158">  
<figDesc>Page 153.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
infatuation; and illustrates a condition of things,  
at that time and place, that is truly astonishing.</p>  
<p>On the evening before Hutchinson was imposed  
upon, as just described, by Abigail Williams and Mary  
Walcot, Ann Putnam had made most astonishing disclosures, at her father's house, in his presence and  
that of Peter Prescott, Robert Morrel, and Ezekiel  
Cheever. An account of the affair was drawn up by  
her father, and sworn to by her, in these words: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> who testifieth and  
saith, on the 20th of April, 1692, at evening, she saw the  
apparition of a minister, at which she was grievously affrighted, and cried out, `Oh, dreadful, dreadful! here is a  
minister come! What! are ministers witches too? Whence  
came you, and what is your name? for I will complain of  
you, though you be a minister, if you be a wizard.' Immediately I was tortured by him, being racked and almost  
choked by him. And he tempted me to write in his book,  
which I refused with loud outcries, and said I would not  
write in his book though he tore me all to pieces, but told  
him it was a dreadful thing that he, which was a minister,  
that should teach children to fear God, should come to  
persuade poor creatures to give their souls to the Devil.  
`Oh, dreadful, dreadful! Tell me your name, that I may  
know who you are.' Then again he tortured me, and  
urged me to write in his book, which I refused. And  
then, presently, he told me that his name was George  
Burroughs, and that he had had three wives, and that he had  
bewitched the two first of them to death; and that he killed  
Mrs. Lawson, because she was so unwilling to go from the  
Village, and also killed Mr. Lawson's child because he went  
<pb n="154" id="vII154"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2159">  
<figDesc>Page 154.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to the eastward with Sir Edmon, and preached so to the  
soldiers; and that he had bewitched a great many soldiers  
to death at the eastward when Sir Edmon was there; and  
that he had made Abigail Hobbs a witch, and several  
witches more. And he has continued ever since, by times,  
tempting me to write in his book, and grievously torturing  
me by beating, pinching, and almost choking me several  
times a day. He also told me that he was above a witch.  
He was a conjurer.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Her father and the other persons present made  
oath that they saw and heard all this at the time;  
that &ldquo;they beheld her tortures and perceived her  
hellish temptations by her loud outcries, `I will not,  
I will not write, though you torment me all the days  
of my life.&rdquo;' It will be observed that this was the  
evening before Thomas Putnam wrote his letter to  
the magistrates, preparing them for something &ldquo;high  
and dreadful&rdquo; that was soon to be brought to light.</p>  
<p>A similar scene took place not long afterwards, in  
the presence of her father and her uncle Edward, to  
which they also testify. It was thus described by  
her under oath: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> who testifieth and  
saith, that, on the 8th of May, at evening, I saw the apparition of Mr. George Burroughs, who grievously tortured  
me, and urged me to write in his book, which I refused.  
He then told me that his two first wives would appear  
to me presently, and tell me a great many lies, but I should  
not believe them. Then immediately appeared to me the  
forms of two women in winding-sheets, and napkins about  
<pb n="155" id="vII155"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2160">  
<figDesc>Page 155.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
their heads, at which I was greatly affrighted; and they  
turned their faces towards Mr. Burroughs, and looked very  
red and angry, and told him that he had been a cruel  
man to them, and that their blood did cry for vengeance  
against him; and also told him that they should be clothed  
with white robes in heaven, when he should be cast into  
hell; and immediately he vanished away. And, as soon as  
he was gone, the two women turned their faces towards  
me, and looked as pale as a white wall; and told me that  
they were Mr. Burroughs's two first wives, and that he had  
murdered them. And one of them told me that she was  
his first wife, and he stabbed her under the left arm, and  
put a piece of sealing-wax on the wound. And she pulled  
aside the winding-sheet, and showed me the place; and also  
told me, that she was in the house where Mr. Parris now  
lives, when it was done. And the other told me, that Mr.  
Burroughs and that wife which he hath now, killed her in  
the vessel, as she was coming to see her friends, because  
they would have one another. And they both charged me  
that I should tell these things to the magistrates before  
Mr. Burroughs' face; and, if he did not own them, they  
did not know but they should appear there. This morning,  
also, Mrs. Lawson and her daughter Ann appeared to me,  
whom I knew, and told me Mr. Burroughs murdered them.  
This morning also appeared to me another woman in a  
winding-sheet, and told me that she was Goodman Fuller's  
first wife, and Mr. Burroughs killed her because there was  
some difference between her husband and him.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This was indeed most extraordinary language and  
imagery to have been used by a child of twelve years  
of age. It is not strange, that, upon a community,  
<pb n="156" id="vII156"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2161">  
<figDesc>Page 156.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
whose fancies and fears had been so long wrought upon,  
holding their views, the effect was awfully great. The  
very fact that it was a child that spoke made her  
declarations seem supernatural. Then, again, they  
were accompanied with such ocular demonstration,  
in her terrible bodily sufferings, that none remained in  
doubt of the truthfulness and reality of what they listened to and beheld. It did not enter their imaginations, for a moment, that there was any deception or  
imposture, or even delusion, on her part. Her case is  
truly a problem not easily solved even now. While  
we are filled with horror and indignation at the thought  
that she figures as a capital and fatal witness in all  
the trials, it is impossible not to feel that a wisdom  
greater than ours is necessary to fathom the dark mystery of the phenomena presented by her and her  
mother and other accusers, in this monstrous and terrible affair.</p>  
<p>These occurrences, happening just before Mr. Burroughs was brought to the village as a prisoner, were  
bruited from house to house, from mouth to mouth,  
and worked the people to a state of horrified exasperation against him; and he was met with execration,  
when, on the 4th of May, Field-marshal Partridge appeared with him at Salem, and delivered him to the  
jailer there. When we consider the distance and the  
circumstances of travel at that time, it is evident that  
the officers charged with the service acted with the  
greatest promptitude, celerity, and energy. The tradition is, that they found Mr. Burroughs in his humble  
<pb n="157" id="vII157"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2162">  
<figDesc>Page 157.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
home, partaking of his frugal meal; that he was  
snatched from the table without a moment's opportunity to provide for his family, or prepare himself for  
the journey, and hurried on his way roughly, and  
without the least explanation of what it all meant.  
As soon as it was known that he was in jail in Salem,  
arrangements were commenced for his examination.  
The public mind was highly excited; and it was determined to make the occasion as impressive, effective,  
and awe-striking as possible. Another &ldquo;field-day&rdquo;  
was to be had. On the 9th of May, a special session of  
the Magistracy was held, &mdash; William Stoughton coming  
from Dorchester, and Samuel Sewall from Boston, to  
sit with Hathorne and Corwin, and give greater  
solemnity and severity to the proceedings. Stoughton  
presided. The first step in the proceedings was to have  
a private hearing, in the presence of the magistrates  
and ministers only; and the report of what passed  
there gives proof of what is indicated more or less  
clearly in several passages in the accounts that have  
come down to us in reference to Mr. Burroughs, &mdash;  
that he was regarded as not wholly sound in doctrine  
on points not connected with witchcraft, was treated  
with special severity on that account, and made the  
victim of bigoted prejudice among his brethren and in  
the churches. In this secret inquisition, he was called  
to account for not attending the communion service  
on one or two occasions; he being a member of the  
church at Roxbury. It was also brought against him,  
that none of his children but the eldest had been  
<pb n="158" id="vII158"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2163">  
<figDesc>Page 158.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
baptized. What the facts, in these respects, were, it  
is impossible to say; as we know of them only through  
the charges of his enemies. After this, he was carried  
to the place of public meeting; and, as he entered the  
room, &ldquo;many, if not all, the bewitched were grievously  
tortured.&rdquo; After the confusion had subsided, Susanna Sheldon testified that Burroughs' two wives  
had appeared to her &ldquo;in their winding-sheets,&rdquo; and  
said, &ldquo;That man killed them.&rdquo; He was ordered to  
look on the witness; and, as he turned to do so, he  
&ldquo;knocked down,&rdquo; as the reporter affirms, &ldquo;all (or  
most) of the afflicted that stood behind him.&rdquo; Ann  
Putnam, and the several other &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo;  
bore their testimony in a similar strain against him,  
interspersing at intervals, all their various convulsions,  
outcries, and tumblings. Mercy Lewis had &ldquo;a dreadful and tedious fit.&rdquo; Walcot, Hubbard, and Sheldon  
were cast into torments simultaneously. At length,  
they were &ldquo;so tortured&rdquo; that &ldquo;authority ordered  
them&rdquo; to be removed. Their sufferings were greater  
than the magistrates and people could longer endure  
to look upon. The question was put to Burroughs,  
&ldquo;what he thought of these things.&rdquo; He answered,  
&ldquo;it was an amazing and humbling providence, but he  
understood nothing of it.&rdquo; Throwing aside all the  
foolish and ridiculous gossip and all the monstrous  
fables that belong to the accusations against him, and  
looking at the only known facts in his history, it  
appears that Mr. Burroughs was a man of ingenuous  
nature, free from guile, unsuspicious of guile in  
<pb n="159" id="vII159"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2164">  
<figDesc>Page 159.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
others; a disinterested, humble, patient, and generous  
person. He had suffered much wrong, and endured  
  
great hardships in life; but they had not impaired his  
readiness to labor and suffer for others. There was  
no combativeness or vindictiveness in his disposition.  
Even in the midst of the unspeakable outrages he was  
experiencing on this occasion, he does not appear to  
be incensed or irritated, but simply &ldquo;amazed.&rdquo; To  
have such horrid crimes laid to him, instead of rousing  
a violent spirit within him, impressed him with a humbling sense of an inscrutable Providence. There is a  
remarkable similarity in the manner in which Rebecca  
Nurse and George Burroughs received the dreadful  
accusations brought against them. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she  
said, &ldquo;what sin hath God found out in me unrepented  
of that he should lay such an affliction upon me in my  
old age?&rdquo; His words are, &ldquo;It is an humbling providence of God.&rdquo; The more we reflect upon this language, and go to the depths of the spirit that suggested  
it, the more we realize, that, in each case, it arose from  
a sanctified Christian heart, and is an attestation in  
vindication and in honor of the sufferers from whose  
lips it fell, that outweighs all passions and prejudices,  
reverses all verdicts, and commands the conviction of  
all fair and honest minds.</p>  
<p>After the &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; had been sent out of the room,  
there was testimony to show that Mr. Burroughs had  
given proof of physical strength, which, in a man of  
his small stature, was sure evidence that he was in  
league with the Devil. Many marvellous statements  
<pb n="160" id="vII160"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2165">  
<figDesc>Page 160.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
were made to this effect, some of the most extravagant of which he denied. He undoubtedly was a  
person of great strength. He had cultivated muscular exercise and development while an undergraduate  
at Cambridge, and was early celebrated as a gymnast.  
After a while, the accusers and afflicted were again  
brought in. Abigail Hobbs testified that she was present at a &ldquo;witch meeting, in the field near Mr. Parris's  
house,&rdquo; in which Mr. Burroughs acted a conspicuous  
part. Mary Warren swore that &ldquo;Mr. Burroughs had  
a trumpet which he blew to summon the witches to  
their feasts&rdquo; and other meetings &ldquo;near Mr. Parris's  
house.&rdquo; This trumpet had a sound that reached over  
the country far and wide, sending its blasts to Andover, and wakening its echoes along the Merrimack, to  
Cape Ann, and the uttermost settlements everywhere;  
so that the witches, hearing it, would mount their  
brooms, and alight, in a moment, in Mr. Parris's  
orchard, just to the north and west of the parsonage;  
but its sound was not heard by any other ears than  
those of confederates with Satan. While the girls were  
giving their testimony, every once in a while they  
would be dreadfully choked, appearing to be in the  
last stages of suffocation and strangulation; and, coming to, at intervals, would charge it upon Burroughs  
or other witches, calling them by name; generally,  
however, confining their selection to persons already  
apprehended, and not bringing in others until measures were matured. Mr. Burroughs was committed  
for trial.</p>  
<pb n="161" id="vII161"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2166">  
<figDesc>Page 161.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>The examination of Mr. Burroughs presented a  
spectacle, all things considered, of rare interest and  
curiosity, &mdash; the grave dignity of the magistrates; the  
plain, dark figure of the prisoner; the half-crazed, halfdemoniac aspect of the girls; the wild, excited crowd;  
the horror, rage, and pallid exasperation of Lawson,  
Goodman Fuller and others, also of the relatives and  
friends of Burroughs's two former wives, as the deep  
damnation of their taking off and the secrets of their  
bloody graves were being brought to light; and the  
child on the stand telling her awful tale of ghosts  
in winding-sheets, with napkins round their heads,  
pointing to their death-wounds, and saying that &ldquo;their  
blood did cry for vengeance&rdquo; upon their murderer.  
The prisoner stands alone: all were raving around him,  
while he is amazed; astounded at such folly and  
wrong in others, and humbly sensible of his own unworthiness; bowed down under the mysterious Providence, that permitted such things for a season, yet  
strong and steadfast in conscious innocence and uprightness.</p>  
<p>To complete the proceedings against Burroughs at  
this time, and raise to the highest point the public  
abhorrence of him, effective use was made of Deliverance Hobbs, the wife of William Hobbs, of whom I  
have spoken before. She was first examined April  
22. During the earlier part of the proceedings, she  
maintained her integrity and protested her innocence  
in a manner which shows that her self-possession held  
good. But the examination was protracted; her  
<pb n="162" id="vII162"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2167">  
<figDesc>Page 162.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
strength was exhausted; the declarations of the accusers, their dreadful sufferings, the prejudgment of the  
case against her by the magistrates, and the combined  
influences of all the circumstances around her, broke  
her down. Her firmness, courage, and truth fled; and  
she began to confess all that was laid to her charge.  
The record is interesting as showing how gradually  
she was overwhelmed and overcome. But while mentioning the names of others whom she pretended to  
have been associated with as witches, she did not speak  
of Burroughs. She referred to those who had been  
brought out before that date, but not to him. The intended movement against him had not then been  
divulged. On the 3d of May, the day before he arrived,  
after it was known that officers had been sent to arrest  
him, she was examined again. On this occasion, she  
charged Burroughs with having been present, and  
taken a leading part in witch-meetings, which she had  
described in detail, at her first examination, without  
mentioning him at all. This proves that the confessing prisoners were apprised of what it was desired  
they should say, and that their testimony was prepared for them by the managers of the affair. The  
following is one of the confessions made by this woman,  
subsequent to her public examination. I give it partly  
to show what a flood of falsehood was poured upon  
Burroughs, and partly because it will serve as a  
specimen of the stuff of which the confessions were  
composed: &mdash;</p>

<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The First Examination of Deliverance Hobbs in Prison.</hi>  
&mdash; She continued in the free acknowledging herself to be a  
covenant witch: and further confesseth she was warned to  
a meeting yesterday morning, and that there was present  
Procter and his wife, Goody Nurse, Giles Corey and his wife,  
Goody Bishop alias Oliver; and Mr. Burroughs was their  
preacher, and pressed them to bewitch all in the village,  
telling them they should do it gradually, and not all at once,  
assuring them they should prevail. He administered the  
sacrament unto them at the same time, with red bread and  
red wine like blood. She affirms she saw Osburn, Sarah  
Good, Goody Wilds, Goody Nurse: and Goody Wilds distributed the bread and wine; and a man in a long-crowned  
white hat sat next the minister, and they sat seemingly at a  
table, and they filled out the wine in tankards. The notice  
of this meeting was given her by Goody Wilds. She, herself affirms, did not nor would not eat nor drink, but all the  
rest did, who were there present; therefore they threatened  
to torment her. The meeting was in the pasture by Mr.  
Parris's house, and she saw when Abigail Williams ran out  
to speak with them; but, by that time Abigail was come a  
little distance from the house, this examinant was struck  
blind, so that she saw not with whom Abigail spake. She  
further saith, that Goody Wilds, to prevail with her to sign,  
told her, that, if she would put her hand to the book, she  
would give her some clothes, and would not afflict her any  
more. Her daughter, Abigail Hobbs, being brought in at  
the same time, while her mother was present, was immediately taken with a dreadful fit; and her mother, being  
asked who it was that hurt her daughter, answered it was  
Goodman Corey, and she saw him and the gentlewoman of  
Boston striving to break her daughter's neck.&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>On the next day, warrants were procured against  
George Jacobs, Sr., and his grand-daughter, Margaret  
Jacobs. They were forthwith seized and brought in  
by Constable Joseph Neal, of Salem, whose return is  
as follows: &ldquo;May 10, 1692. Then I apprehended the  
bodies of George Jacobs, Sr., and Margaret, daughter of  
George Jacobs, Jr., according to the tenor of the above  
warrant.&rdquo; The examinations, on this occasion, were  
held at the house of Thomas Beadle, in the town of  
Salem. All the preliminary examinations, so far as  
existing documents show, were either in the meeting at the village or that of the town; or at the  
house of Nathaniel Ingersoll at the village, or Thomas  
Beadle in the town, &mdash; both being inns, or places of  
public entertainment. Beadle's house was on the south  
side of Essex Street, on land now occupied by Nos.  
63 and 65. The eastern boundary of the lot was forty feet from Ingersoll's Lane, now Daniels Street.  
Its front on Essex Street was about sixty feet, and its  
depth about one hundred and forty-five feet. What is  
now No. 65 is on the very spot where Beadle's tavern  
stood; and with the exception of six feet built, as an  
addition, on the eastern side, subsequently to 1733, is  
probably the identical house. The ground now occupied by No. 63 was then an open space. It appears by  
bills of expenses brought &ldquo;against the country,&rdquo; that  
the inn of Samuel Beadle, a brother of Thomas, was  
also sometimes used for purposes connected with the  
prosecutions. Thomas Beadle's bill amounted to &pound;58.  
11<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 5<hi rend="italics">d.;</hi> that of Samuel to &pound;21. The latter, being  
<pb n="165" id="vII165"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2170">  
<figDesc>Page 165.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
near the jail, was probably used for the entertainment  
of constables and the keeping of their horses, as well  
as other incidental purposes connected with the transportation of prisoners.</p>  
<p>A tradition has long prevailed, that the house, still  
standing, of Judge Jonathan Corwin, at the western  
corner of North and Essex Streets, was used at these  
examinations. One form in which this tradition has  
come down is probably correct. The grand jury was  
often in session while the jury for trials was hearing  
cases in the Court-house. There may not have been  
suitable accommodations for both in that building.  
The confused sounds and commotions incident to the  
trials would have been annoying to the grand jury.  
The tradition is, that a place was provided and used  
temporarily by that body, in the Corwin house, supposed to have been the spacious room at the southeastern corner. As the investigations of the grand  
jury were not open to the public, its occasional sittings  
would not be seriously incompatible with the convenience of a family, or detrimental to the grounds or  
apartments of a handsome private residence. Indeed,  
it would hardly have been allowable or practicable to  
have had the examinations before the magistrates in  
any other than a public house. They were always frequented by a promiscuous crowd, and generally scenes  
of tumultuary disorder.</p>  
<p>George Jacobs, Sr., was an aged man. He is represented in the evidence as &ldquo;very gray-headed;&rdquo; and he  
must have been quite infirm, for he walked with two  
<pb n="166" id="vII166"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2171">  
<figDesc>Page 166.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
staffs. His hair was in long, thin, white locks; and,  
as he was uncommonly tall of stature, he must have had  
a venerable aspect. Perhaps he was the &ldquo;man in a long white hat,&rdquo; referred to by Deliverance Hobbs.  
The examination shows that his faculties were vigorous, his bearing fearless, and his utterances strong and  
decided. The magistrates began: &ldquo;Here are them that  
accuse you of acts of witchcraft.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Well, let us hear  
who are they and what are they.&rdquo; When Abigail  
Williams testified against him, going through undoubtedly her usual operations, he could not refrain  
from expressing his contempt for the whole thing by a  
laugh; explaining it by saying, &ldquo;Because I am falsely  
accused &mdash; your worships all of you, do you think this  
is true?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Nay: what do you think?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I never did it.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Don't ask me.&rdquo;  
The magistrates always took it for granted that the  
pretensions and sufferings of the girls were real, and  
threw upon the accused the responsibility of explaining  
them. They continued: &ldquo;Why should we not ask  
you? Sarah Churchill accuseth you. There she is.&rdquo;  
Jacobs was of opinion that it was not for him to explain the actions of the girls, but for the prosecuting  
party to prove his guilt. &ldquo;If you can prove that I  
am guilty, I will lie under it.&rdquo; Then Sarah Churchill,  
who was a servant in his family, said, &ldquo;Last night,  
I was afflicted at Deacon Ingersoll's; and Mary Walcot  
said it was a man with two staves: it was my master.&rdquo;  
It seems, that, after the proceedings against Burroughs  
were over, a meeting of &ldquo;the circle&rdquo; took place in the  
<pb n="167" id="vII167"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2172">  
<figDesc>Page 167.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
evening, at Deacon Ingersoll's, at which there was a  
repetition of the actings of the girls; and that Mary  
Walcot suggested to Churchill to accuse her master.  
This shows the way in which the delusion was kept  
up. Probably, such meetings were held at one house  
or another in the village, and fresh accusations brought  
forward, continually. Jacobs appealed to the magistrates, trying to recall them to a sense of fairness.  
&ldquo;Pray, do not accuse me: I am as clear as your worships. You must do right judgment.&rdquo; Sarah Churchill  
charged him with having hurt her; and the magistrates,  
pushing her on to make further charges, said to her,  
&ldquo;Did he not appear on the other side of the river, and  
hurt you? Did not you see him?&rdquo; She answered,  
&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo; Then, turning to him, the magistrates  
said, &ldquo;There, she accuseth you to your face: she chargeth you that you hurt her twice.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;It is not true.  
What would you have me say? I never wronged no  
man in word nor deed.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Is it no harm to afflict  
these?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I never did it.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;But how comes it to  
be in your appearance?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;The Devil can take any  
likeness.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Not without their consent.&rdquo; Jacobs  
rejected the imputation. &ldquo;You tax me for a wizard:  
you may as well tax me for a buzzard. I have done no  
harm.&rdquo; Churchill said, &ldquo;I know you lived a wicked  
life.&rdquo; Jacobs, turning to the magistrates, said, &ldquo;Let  
her make it out.&rdquo; The magistrates asked her, &ldquo;Doth  
he ever pray in his family?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Not unless by himself.&rdquo; The magistrates, addressing him:  
&ldquo;Why do you not pray in your family?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;I cannot  
<pb n="168" id="vII168"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2173">  
<figDesc>Page 168.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
read.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Well, but you may pray for all that. Can  
you say the Lord's Prayer? Let us hear you.&rdquo; The  
reporter, Mr. Parris, says, &ldquo;He missed in several  
parts of it, and could not repeat it right after many  
trials.&rdquo; The magistrates, addressing her, said, &ldquo;Were  
you not frighted, Sarah Churchill, when the representation of your master came to you?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  
Jacobs exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, burn me or hang me, I will  
stand in the truth of Christ: I know nothing of it.&rdquo;  
In answer to an inquiry from the magistrates, he denied  
having done any thing to get his son George or grand Margaret to &ldquo;sign the book.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The appearance of the old man, his intrepid bearing,  
and the stamp of conscious innocence on all he said,  
probably produced some impression on the magistrates,  
as they did not come to any decision, but adjourned  
the examination to the next day. The girls then  
came down from the village in full force, determined to put him through. When he was brought  
in, they accordingly, all at once, &ldquo;fell into the most  
grievous fits and screechings.&rdquo; When they sufficiently  
came to, the magistrates turned to the girls: &ldquo;Is this  
the man that hurts you?&rdquo; They severally answered,  
&mdash; Abigail Williams: &ldquo;This is the man,&rdquo; and fell into a  
violent fit. Ann Putnam: &ldquo;This is the man. He hurts  
me, and brings the book to me, and would have me  
write in the book, and said, if I would write in it,  
I should be as well as his grand-daughter.&rdquo; Mercy  
Lewis, after much interruptions by fits: &ldquo;This is the  
man: he almost kills me.&rdquo; Elizabeth Hubbard: &ldquo;He  
<pb n="169" id="vII169"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2174">  
<figDesc>Page 169.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
never hurt me till to-day, when he came upon the  
table.&rdquo; Mary Walcot, after much interruption by fits:  
&ldquo;This is the man: he used to come with two staves,  
and beat me with one of them.&rdquo; After all this, the  
magistrates, thinking he could deny it no longer, turn  
to him, &ldquo;What do you say? Are you not a witch?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;No: I know it not, if I were to die presently.&rdquo; Mercy  
Lewis advanced towards him, but, as soon as she got  
near, &ldquo;fell into great fits.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;What do you say to  
this?&rdquo; cried the magistrates. &ldquo;Why, it is false. I  
know not of it any more than the child that was born  
to-night.&rdquo; The reporter says, &ldquo;Ann Putnam and  
Abigail Williams had each of them a pin stuck in  
their hands, and they said it was this old Jacobs.&rdquo;  
He was committed to prison.</p>  
<p>The following piece of evidence is among the loose  
papers on file in the clerk's office: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Sarah Ingersoll,</hi> aged about  
thirty years. &mdash; Saith, that, seeing Sarah Churchill after her  
examination, she came to me crying and wringing her  
hands, seemingly to be much troubled in spirit. I asked  
her what she ailed. She answered, she had undone herself. I asked her in what. She said, in belying herself and  
others in saying she had set her hand to the Devil's book,  
whereas, she said, she never did. I told her I believed she  
had set her hand to the book. She answered, crying, and  
said, `No, no, no: I never, I never did.' I asked her then  
what made her say she did. She answered, because they  
threatened her, and told her they would put her into the  
dungeon, and put her along with Mr. Burroughs; and thus  
<pb n="170" id="vII170"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2175">  
<figDesc>Page 170.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
several times she followed me up and down, telling me that  
she had undone herself, in belying herself and others. I  
asked her why she did not deny she wrote it. She told me,  
because she had stood out so long in it, that now she durst  
not. She said also, that, if she told Mr. Noyes but once  
she had set her hand to the book, he would believe her; but,  
if she told the truth, and said she had not set her hand to the  
book a hundred times, he would not believe her.</p>  
<p rend="right">&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Sarah Ingersoll.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This paper has also the signature of &ldquo;Ann Andrews.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>This incident probably occurred during the examination of George Jacobs; and the bitter compunction  
of Churchill was in consequence of the false and malignant course she had been pursuing against her old  
master. It is a relief to our feelings, so far as she is  
regarded, to suppose so. Bad as her conduct was as  
one of the accusers, on other occasions after I am  
sorry to say as well as before, it shows that she was  
not entirely dead to humanity, but realized the iniquity  
of which she had been guilty towards him. It is the  
only instance of which we find notice of any such a  
remnant of conscience showing itself, at the time,  
among those perverted and depraved young persons.  
The reason, why it is probable that this exhibition of  
Churchill's penitential tears and agonies of remorse  
occurred immediately after the first day of Jacobs's  
examination, is this. It was one of the first, if not  
the first, held at the house of Thomas Beadle. Sarah  
Ingersoll would not have been likely to have fallen in  
<pb n="171" id="vII171"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2176">  
<figDesc>Page 171.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
with her elsewhere. It is evident, from the tenor and  
purport of the document, that the deponent was not  
entirely carried away by the prevalent delusion, and  
probably did not follow up the proceedings generally.  
But it was quite natural that her attention should  
have been called to proceedings of interest at Beadle's  
house, particularly on that first occasion. She lived  
in the immediate vicinity. The indorsement by Ann  
Andrews, the daughter of Jacobs, increases the probability that the occurrence was at his examination.</p>  
<p>The representatives of the family of John Ingersoll,  
&mdash; a brother of Deacon Nathaniel Ingersoll, &mdash; in 1692,  
occupied a series of houses on the west side of Daniels Street, leading from Essex Street to the harbor.  
The widow of John's son Nathaniel lived at the corner  
of Essex and Daniels Streets; the next in order was  
the widow of his son John; the next, his daughter  
Ruth, wife of Richard Rose; the next, the widow of  
his son Richard; the last, his son Samuel, whose house  
lot extended to the water. Sarah, the witness in this  
case, was the wife of Samuel, and afterwards became  
the second wife of Philip English. One of her children appears to have married a son of Beadle. Their  
immediate proximity to the Beadle house, and consequent intimacy with his family, led them to become  
conversant with what occurred there; and Sarah Ingersoll was, in that way, likely to meet Churchill, and to  
have the conversation with her to which she deposes.</p>  
<p>This brief deposition of Sarah Ingersoll is, in many  
particulars, an important and instructive paper. It  
<pb n="172" id="vII172"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2177">  
<figDesc>Page 172.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
exhibits incidentally the means employed to keep the  
accusing girls and confessing witnesses from falling  
back, and, by overawing them, to prevent their acknowledging the falseness of their testimony. It shows how  
difficult it was to obtain a hearing, if they were disposed to recant. It presents Mr. Noyes &mdash; as all along  
there is too much evidence compelling us to admit  
&mdash; acting a part as bad as that of Parris; and it discloses the fact, that Mr. Burroughs, although not yet  
brought to trial, was immured in a dungeon.</p>  
<p>No papers are on file, or have been obtained, in  
reference to the examination of Margaret Jacobs, which  
was at the same time and place with that of her grandfather. We shall hear of her in subsequent stages of  
the transaction.</p>  
<p>On the same day &mdash; May 10 &mdash; that George and Margaret Jacobs were apprehended and examined, a warrant was issued against John Willard, &ldquo;husbandman,&rdquo;  
to be brought to Thomas Beadle's house in Salem.  
On the 12th, John Putnam, Jr., constable, made return  
that he had been to &ldquo;the house of the usual abode of  
John Willard, and made search for him, and in several  
other houses and places, but could not find him;&rdquo; and  
that &ldquo;his relations and friends&rdquo; said, &ldquo;that, to their  
best knowledge, he was fled.&rdquo; On the 15th, a warrant  
was issued to the marshal of Essex, and the constables  
of Salem, &ldquo;or any other marshal, or marshal's constable  
or constables within this their majesty's colony or territory of the Massachusetts, in New England,&rdquo; requiring  
them to apprehend said Willard, &ldquo;if he may be found  
<pb n="173" id="vII173"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2178">  
<figDesc>Page 173.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in your precincts, who stands charged with sundry  
acts of witchcraft, by him done or committed on the  
bodies of Bray Wilkins, and Samuel Wilkins, the son  
of Henry Wilkins,&rdquo; and others, upon complaint made  
&ldquo;by Thomas Fuller, Jr., and Benjamin Wilkins, Sr.,  
yeomen; who, being found, you are to convey from  
town to town, from constable to constable,... to  
be prosecuted according to the direction of Constable  
John Putnam, of Salem Village, who goes with the  
same.&rdquo; On the 18th of May, Constable Putnam  
brought in Willard, and delivered him to the magistrates. He was seized in Groton. There is no record  
of his examination; but we gather, from the papers  
on file, the following facts relating to this interesting  
case: &mdash;</p>  
<p>It is said that Willard had been called upon to aid  
in the arrest, custody, and bringing-in of persons accused, acting as a deputy-constable; and, from his  
observation of the deportment of the prisoners, and  
from all he heard and saw, his sympathies became  
excited in their behalf: and he expressed, in more or  
less unguarded terms, his disapprobation of the proceedings. He seems to have considered all hands  
concerned in the business &mdash; accusers, accused, magistrates, and people &mdash; as alike bewitched. One of the  
witnesses against him deposed, that he said, in a &ldquo;discourse&rdquo; at the house of a relative, &ldquo;Hang them: they  
are all witches.&rdquo; In consequence of this kind of  
talk, in which he indulged as early as April, he incurred the ill-will of the parties engaged in the prose  
<pb n="174" id="vII174"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2179">  
<figDesc>Page 174.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
cutions; and it was whispered about that he was  
himself in the diabolical confederacy. He was a  
grandson of Bray Wilkins; and the mind of the old  
man became prejudiced against him, and most of his  
family connections and neighbors partook of the feeling. When Willard discovered that such rumors were  
in circulation against him, he went to his grandfather for counsel and the aid of his prayers. He  
met with a cold reception, as appears by the deposition  
of the old man as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;When John Willard was first complained of by the  
afflicted persons for afflicting of them, he came to my house,  
greatly troubled, desiring me, with some other neighbors, to  
pray for him. I told him I was then going from home, and  
could not stay; but, if I could come home before night, I  
should not be unwilling. But it was near night before I came  
home, and so I did not answer his desire; but I heard no more  
of him upon that account. Whether my not answering his  
desire did not offend him, I cannot tell; but I was jealous,  
afterwards, that it did.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Willard soon after made an engagement to go to  
Boston, on election-week, with Henry Wilkins, Jr. A  
son of said Henry Wilkins, named Daniel, &mdash; a youth  
of seventeen years of age, who had heard the stories  
against Willard, and believed them all, remonstrated  
with his father against going to Boston with Willard,  
and seemed much distressed at the thought, saying,  
among other things, &ldquo;It were well if the said Willard  
were hanged.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Old Bray Wilkins must go to election too; and so  
<pb n="175" id="vII175"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2180">  
<figDesc>Page 175.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
started off on horseback, &mdash; the only mode of travel  
then practicable from Will's Hill to Winnesimit Ferry,  
&mdash;with his wife on a pillion behind him. He was eightytwo years of age, and she probably not much less; for  
she had been the wife of his youth. The old couple  
undoubtedly had an active time that week in Boston.  
It was a great occasion, and the whole country flocked  
in to partake in the ceremonies and services of the  
anniversary. On Election-day, with his wife, he rode  
out to Dorchester, to dine at the house of his &ldquo;brother,  
Lieutenant Richard Way.&rdquo; Deodat Lawson and his  
new wife, and several more, joined them at table. Before sitting down, Henry Wilkins and John Willard  
also came in. Willard, perhaps, did not feel very  
agreeably towards his grandfather, at the time, for  
having shown an unwillingness to pray with him. The  
old man either saw, or imagined he saw, a very unpleasant expression in Willard's countenance. &ldquo;To  
my apprehension, he looked after such a sort upon me  
as I never before discerned in any.&rdquo; The long and  
hard travel, the fatigues and excitements of election, were too much for the old man, tough and rugged  
as he was; and a severe attack of a complaint, to which  
persons of his age are often subject, came on. He  
experienced great sufferings, and, as he expressed it,  
&ldquo;was like a man on a rack.&rdquo;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;I told my wife immediately that I was afraid that Willard  
had done me wrong; my pain continuing, and finding no relief, my jealousy continued. Mr. Lawson and others there  
were all amazed, and knew not what to do for me. There was  
<pb n="176" id="vII176"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2181">  
<figDesc>Page 176.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
a woman accounted skilful came hoping to help me, and after  
she had used means, she asked me whether none of those  
evil persons had done me damage. I said, I could not say  
they had, but I was sore afraid they had. She answered,  
she did fear so too.... As near as I remember. I lay in  
this case three or four days at Boston, and afterward, with  
the jeopardy of my life (as I thought), I came home.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>On his return, he found his grandson, the same  
Daniel who had warned Henry Wilkins against going  
to Boston with John Willard, on his death - bed, in  
great suffering. Another attack of his own malady  
came on. There was great consternation in the neighborhood, and throughout the village. The Devil and  
his confederates, it was thought, were making an awful  
onslaught upon the people at Will's Hill. Parris and  
others rushed to the scene. Mercy Lewis and Mary  
Walcot were carried up to tell who it was that was bewitching old Bray, and young Daniel, and others of the  
Wilkinses who had caught the contagion, and were  
experiencing or imagining all sorts of bodily ails.  
They were taken to the room where Daniel was approaching his death-agonies; and they both affirmed,  
that they saw the spectres of old Mrs. Buckley  
and John Willard &ldquo;upon his throat and upon his  
breast, and pressed him and choked him;&rdquo; and the  
cruel operation, they insisted upon it, continued until  
the boy died. The girls were carried to the bedroom  
of the old man, who was in great suffering; and, when  
they entered, the question was put by the anxious and  
excited friends in the chamber to Mercy Lewis, whether  
<pb n="177" id="vII177"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2182">  
<figDesc>Page 177.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
she saw any thing. She said, &ldquo;Yes: they are looking  
for John Willard.&rdquo; Presently she pretended to have  
caught sight of his apparition, and exclaimed, &ldquo;There  
he is upon his grandfather's belly.&rdquo; This was thought  
wonderful indeed; for, as the old man says in a deposition he drew up afterwards, &ldquo;At that time I was in  
grievous pain in the small of my belly.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Mrs. Ann Putnam had her story to tell about John  
Willard. Its substance is seen in a deposition drawn  
up about the time, and is in the same vein as her  
testimony in other cases; presenting a problem to  
be solved by those who can draw the line between  
semi-insane hallucination and downright fabrication.  
Her deposition is as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;That the shape of Samuel Fuller and Lydia Wilkins  
this day told me at my own house by the bedside, who appeared in winding-sheets, that, if I did not go and tell Mr.  
Hathorne that John Willard had murdered them, they would  
tear me to pieces. I knew them when they were living, and  
it was exactly their resemblance and shape. And, at the  
same time, the apparition of John Willard told me that he  
had killed Samuel Fuller, Lydia Wilkins, Goody Shaw, and  
Fuller's second wife, and Aaron Way's child, and Ben Fuller's  
child; and this deponent's child Sarah, six weeks old; and  
Philip Knight's child, with the help of William Hobbs; and  
Jonathan Knight's child and two of Ezekiel Cheever's children with the help of William Hobbs; Anne Eliot and  
Isaac Nichols with the help of William Hobbs; and that if  
Mr. Hathorne would not believe them, &mdash; that is, Samuel  
Fuller and Lydia Wilkins, &mdash; perhaps they would appear to  
<pb n="178" id="vII178"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2183">  
<figDesc>Page 178.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the magistrates. Joseph Fuller's apparition the same day  
also came to me, and told me that Goody Corey had killed  
him. The spectre aforesaid told me, that vengeance, vengeance, was cried by said Fuller. This relation is true.</p>  
<p rend="right">&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Ann Putnam.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It appears by such papers as are to be found relating  
to Willard's case, that a coroner's jury was held over the  
body of Daniel Wilkins, of which Nathaniel Putnam  
was foreman. It is much to be regretted that the  
finding of that jury is lost. It would be a real  
curiosity. That it was very decisive to the point,  
affirmed by Mercy Lewis and Mary Walcot, that Daniel  
was choked and strangled by the spectres of John  
Willard and Goody Buckley, is apparent from the  
manner in which Bray Wilkins speaks of it. In an  
argument between him and some persons who were  
expressing their confidence that John Willard was an  
innocent man, he sought to relieve himself from responsibility for Willard's conviction by saying, &ldquo;It  
was not I, nor my son Benjamin Wilkins, but the  
testimony of the afflicted persons, and the jury concerning the murder of my grandson, Daniel Wilkins,  
that would take away his life, if any thing did.&rdquo; Mr.  
Parris, of course, was in the midst of these proceedings  
at Will's Hill; attended the visits of the afflicted girls  
when they went to ascertain who were the witches  
murdering young Daniel and torturing the old man;  
was present, no doubt, at the solemn examinations and  
investigations of the sages who sat as a jury of inquest  
<pb n="179" id="vII179"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2184">  
<figDesc>Page 179.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
over the former, and, in all likelihood, made, as  
usual, a written report of the same. As soon as he  
got back to his house, he discharged his mind, and  
indorsed the verdict of the coroner's jury by this  
characteristic insertion in his church-records: &ldquo;Dan:  
Wilkins. Bewitched to death.&rdquo; The very next  
entry relates to a case of which this obituary line, in  
Mr. Parris's church-book, is the only intimation that  
has come down to us, &ldquo;Daughter to Ann Douglas. By  
witchcraft, I doubt not.&rdquo; Willard's examination was  
at Beadle's, on the 18th. With this deluge of accusations and tempest of indignation beating upon him, he  
had but little chance, and was committed.</p>  
<p>While the marshals and constables were in pursuit  
of Willard, the time was well improved by the prosecutors. On the 12th of May, warrants were issued to  
apprehend, and bring &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; before the magistrates sitting at Beadle's, &ldquo;Alice Parker, the wife of  
John Parker of Salem; and Ann Pudeator of Salem,  
widow.&rdquo; Alice, commonly called Elsie, Parker was  
the wife of a mariner. We know but little of her.  
We have a deposition of one woman, Martha Dutch,  
as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;This deponent testified and saith, that, about two years  
last past, John Jarman, of Salem, coming in from sea, I  
(this deponent and Alice Parker, of Salem, both of us standing together) said unto her, `What a great mercy it was, for  
to see them come home well; and through mercy,' I said,  
`my husband had gone, and come home well, many times.'  
And I, this deponent, did say unto the said Parker, that `I  
<pb n="180" id="vII180"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2185">  
<figDesc>Page 180.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
did hope he would come home this voyage well also.' And  
the said Parker made answer unto me, and said, `No: never  
more in this world.' The which came to pass as she then  
told me; for he died abroad, as I certainly hear.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Perhaps Parker had information which had not  
reached the ears of Dutch, or she may have been  
prone to take melancholy views of the dangers to  
which seafaring people are exposed. It was a strange  
kind of evidence to be admitted against a person in a  
trial for witchcraft.</p>  
<p>Samuel Shattuck, who has been mentioned (vol. i.  
p. 193) in connection with Bridget Bishop, had a  
long story to tell about Alice Parker. He seems to  
have been very active in getting up charges of witchcraft against persons in his neighborhood, and on the  
most absurd and frivolous grounds. Parker had  
made a friendly call upon his wife; and, not long after,  
one of his children fell sick, and he undertook to  
suspect that it was &ldquo;under an evil hand.&rdquo; In similar circumstances, he took the same grudge against  
Bridget Bishop. Alice Parker, hearing that he had  
been circulating suspicions to that effect against her,  
went to his house to remonstrate; an angry altercation took place between them; and he gave his  
version of the affair in evidence. There was no one  
to present the other side. But the whole thing has,  
not only a one-sided, but an irrelevant character, in no  
wise bearing upon the point of witchcraft. All the  
gossip, scandal, and tittle-tattle of the neighborhood  
for twenty years back, in this case as in others, was  
<pb n="181" id="vII181"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2186">  
<figDesc>Page 181.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
raked up, and allowed to be adduced, however utterly  
remote from the questions belonging to the trial.</p>  
<p>The following singular piece of testimony against  
Alice Parker may be mentioned. John Westgate was  
at Samuel Beadle's tavern one night with boon companions; among them John Parker, the husband of  
Alice. She disapproved of her husband's spending his  
evenings in such company, and in a bar-room; and  
felt it necessary to put a stop to it, if she could.  
Westgate says that she &ldquo;came into the company, and  
scolded at and called her husband all to nought;  
whereupon I, the said deponent, took her husband's  
part, telling her it was an unbeseeming thing for her to  
come after him to the tavern, and rail after that rate.  
With that she came up to me, and called me rogue,  
and bid me mind my own business, and told me I had  
better have said nothing.&rdquo; He goes on to state, that,  
returning home one night some time afterwards, he experienced an awful fright. &ldquo;Going from the house of  
Mr. Daniel King, when I came over against John  
Robinson's house, I heard a great noise;... and there  
appeared a black hog running towards me with open  
mouth, as though he would have devoured me at that  
instant time.&rdquo; In the extremity of his terror, he tried  
to run away from the awful monster; but, as might  
have been expected under the circumstances, he tumbled to the ground. &ldquo;I fell down upon my hip, and my  
knife run into my hip up to the haft. When I came  
home, my knife was in my sheath. When I drew it  
out of the sheath, then immediately the sheath fell all  
<pb n="182" id="vII182"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2187">  
<figDesc>Page 182.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to pieces.&rdquo; And further this deponent testifieth, that,  
after he got up from his fall, his stocking and shoe  
was full of blood, and that he was forced to crawl  
along by the fence all the way home; and the hog followed him, and never left him till he came home. He  
further stated that he was accompanied all the way by  
his &ldquo;stout dog,&rdquo; which ordinarily was much inclined  
to attack and &ldquo;worry hogs,&rdquo; but, on this occasion, &ldquo;ran  
away from him, leaping over the fence and crying  
much.&rdquo; In view of all these things, Westgate concludes his testimony thus: &ldquo;Which hog I then apprehended was either the Devil or some evil thing,  
not a real hog; and did then really judge, or determine  
in my mind, that it was either Goody Parker or by her  
means and procuring, fearing that she is a witch.&rdquo;  
The facts were probably these: The sheath was broken  
by his fall, his skin bruised, and some blood got into his  
stocking and shoe. The knife was never out of the  
sheath until he drew it; there was no mystery or witchcraft in it. Nothing was ever more natural than the  
conduct of the dog. When he saw Westgate frightened  
out of his wits at nothing, trying to run as for dear  
life when there was no pursuer, staggering and pitching along in a zigzag direction with very eccentric  
motions, falling heels over head, and then crawling  
along, holding himself up by the fence, and all the  
time looking back with terror, and perhaps attempting  
to express his consternation, the dog could not tell  
what to make of it; and ran off, as a dog would be  
likely to have done, jumping over the fences, barking,  
<pb n="183" id="vII183"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2188">  
<figDesc>Page 183.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and uttering the usual canine ejaculations. Dogs  
sympathize with their masters, and, if there is a frolic  
or other acting going on, are fond of joining in it.  
The whole thing was in consequence of Westgate's not  
having profited by Alice Parker's rebuke, and discontinued his visits by night to Beadle's bar-room.  
The only reason why he saw the &ldquo;black hog with the  
open mouth,&rdquo; and the dog did not see it, and therefore  
failed to come to his protection, was because he had  
been drinking and the dog had not.</p>  
<p>We find among the papers relating to these transactions many other instances of this kind of testimony;  
sounds heard and sights seen by persons going home  
at night through woods, after having spent the evening  
under the bewildering influences of talk about witches,  
Satan, ghosts, and spectres; sometimes, as in this case,  
stimulated by other causes of excitement.</p>  
<p>Perhaps some persons may be curious to know the  
route by which Westgate made out to reach his home,  
while pursued by the horrors of that midnight experience. He seems to have frequented Samuel Beadle's  
bar-room. That old Narragansett soldier owned a lot  
on the west side of St. Peter's Street, occupying the  
southern corner of what is now Church Street, which  
was opened ten years afterwards, that is, in 1702, by  
the name of Epps's Lane. On that lot his tavern stood.  
He also owned one-third of an acre at the present corner of Brown and St. Peter's Streets, on which he had  
a stable and barn; so that his grounds were on both  
sides of St. Peter's Street, &mdash; one parcel on the west,  
<pb n="184" id="vII184"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2189">  
<figDesc>Page 184.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
nearly opposite the present front of the church; the  
other on the east side of St. Peter's Street, opposite  
the south side of the church. From this locality  
Westgate started. He probably did not go down  
Brown Street, for that was then a dark, unfrequented  
lane, but thought it safest to get into Essex Street.  
He made his way along that street, passing the Common, the southern side of which, at that time, with the  
exception of some house-lots on and contiguous to  
the site of the Franklin Building, bordered on Essex  
Street. The casualty of his fall; the catastrophe to  
his hip, stocking, and shoe; and the witchery practised  
upon his knife and its sheath, &mdash; occurred &ldquo;over against  
John Robinson's house,&rdquo; which was on the eastern  
corner of Pleasant and Essex Streets. Christopher  
Babbage's house, from which he thought the &ldquo;great  
noise&rdquo; came, was next beyond Robinson's. He crawled  
along the fences and the sides of the houses until he  
reached the passage-way on the western side of Thomas  
Beadle's house, and through that managed to get to  
his own house, which was directly south of said Beadle lot, between it and the harbor.</p>  
<p>There is one item in reference to Alice Parker,  
which indicates that the zeal of the prosecutors in  
her case, as in that of Mr. Burroughs, and perhaps  
others, was aggravated by a suspicion that she was  
heretical on some points of the prevalent creed of the  
day. Parris says that &ldquo;Mr. Noyes, at the time of her  
examination, affirmed to her face, that, he being with  
her at a time of sickness, discoursing with her about  
<pb n="185" id="vII185"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2190">  
<figDesc>Page 185.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
witchcraft, whether she were not guilty, she answered, `if she was as free from other sins as from  
witchcraft, she would not ask of the Lord mercy.&rdquo;'  
The manner of expression in this passage shows that  
it was thought that there was something very shocking  
in her answer. Mr. Noyes &ldquo;affirmed to her face.&rdquo;  
No doubt it was thought that she denied the doctrine  
of original and transmitted, or imputed sin.</p>  
<p>Ann Pudeator (pronounced Pud-e-tor) was the widow  
of Jacob Pudeator, and probably about seventy years of  
age. The name is spelt variously, and was originally, as  
it is sometimes found, Poindexter. She was a woman  
of property, owning two estates on the north line of the  
Common; that on which she lived comprised what is  
between Oliver and Winter Streets. She was arrested  
and brought to examination on the 12th of May.  
There is ground to conclude, from the tenor of the  
documents, that she was then discharged. Some people in the town were determined to gratify their spleen  
against her, and procured her re-arrest. The examination took place on the 2d of July, and she was then  
committed. The evidence was, if possible, more  
frivolous and absurd than in other cases. The girls  
acted their usual parts, giving, on this occasion, a particularly striking exhibition of the transmission of  
the diabolical virus out of themselves back into the  
witch by a touch of her body. &ldquo;Ann Putnam fell into  
a fit, and said Pudeator was commanded to take her  
by the wrist, and did; and said Putnam was well presently. Mary Warren fell into two fits quickly, after  
<pb n="186" id="vII186"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2191">  
<figDesc>Page 186.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
one another; and both times was helped by said  
Pudeator's taking her by the wrist.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>When well acted, this must have been one of the  
most impressive and effective of all the methods employed in these performances. To see a young woman  
or girl suddenly struck down, speechless, pallid as in  
death; with muscles rigid, eyeballs fixed or rolled back  
in their sockets; the stiffened frame either wholly prostrate or drawn up into contorted attitudes and shapes,  
or vehemently convulsed with racking pains, or dropping with relaxed muscles into a lifeless lump; and to  
hear dread shrieks of delirious ravings, &mdash; must have  
produced a truly frightful effect upon an excited and  
deluded assembly. The constables and their assistants  
would go to the rescue, lift the body of the sufferer,  
and bear it in their arms towards the prisoner. The  
magistrates and the crowd, hushed in the deepest  
silence, would watch with breathless awe the result of  
the experiment, while the officers slowly approached  
the accused, who, when they came near, would, in  
obedience to the order of the magistrates, hold out a  
hand, and touch the flesh of the afflicted one. Instantly the spasms cease, the eyes open, color returns  
to the countenance, the limbs resume their position  
and functions, and life and intelligence are wholly restored. The sufferer comes to herself, walks back, and  
takes her seat as well as ever. The effect upon the  
accused person must have been confounding. It is a  
wonder that it did not oftener break them down. It  
sometimes did. Poor Deliverance Hobbs, when the  
<pb n="187" id="vII187"/>

<figDesc>Page 187.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
process was tried upon her, was wholly overcome, and  
passed from conscious and calmly asserted innocence  
to a helpless abandonment of reason, conscience, and  
herself, exclaiming, &ldquo;I am amazed! I am amazed!&rdquo;  
and assented afterwards to every charge brought  
against her, and said whatever she was told, or supposed they wished her to say.</p>  
<p>On the 14th of May, warrants were issued against  
Daniel Andrew; George Jacobs, Jr.; his wife, Rebecca  
Jacobs; Sarah Buckley, wife of William Buckley; and  
Mary Whittredge, daughter of said Buckley, &mdash; all of  
Salem Village; Elizabeth Hart, wife of Isaac Hart,  
of Lynn; Thomas Farrar, Sr., also of Lynn; Elizabeth Colson, of Reading; and Bethiah Carter, of  
Woburn. There is nothing of special interest among  
the few papers that are on file relating to Hart, Colson,  
or Carter. The constable made return that he had  
searched the houses of Daniel Andrew and George  
Jacobs, Jr., but could not find them. He brought in  
forthwith the bodies of Sarah Buckley, Mary Whittredge, and Rebecca Jacobs. Farrar and the rest were  
brought in shortly afterwards.</p>  
<p>Daniel Andrew was one of the leading men of the  
village, and the warrant against him was proof that  
soon none would be too high to be reached by the  
prosecutors. He felt that it was in vain to attempt to  
resist their destructive power; and, getting notice in  
some way of the approach of the constable, with his  
near neighbor, friend, and connection, George Jacobs,  
<pb n="188" id="vII188"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2193">  
<figDesc>Page 188.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Jr., effected his escape, and found refuge in a foreign  
country.</p>  
<p>Rebecca, the wife of George Jacobs, Jr., was the  
victim of a partial derangement. Her daughter Margaret was already in jail. Her husband had escaped  
by a hurried flight, and his father was in prison awaiting his trial. She was left in a lonely and unprotected  
condition, in a country but thinly settled, in the midst  
of woods. The constable came with his warrant for  
her. She was driven to desperation, and was inclined  
to resist; but he persuaded her to go with him by holding out the inducement that she would soon be permitted to return. Four young children, one of them  
an infant, were left in the house; but those who were  
old enough to walk followed after, crying, endeavoring to overtake her. Some of the neighbors took them  
into their houses. The imprisonment of a woman in  
her situation and mental condition was an outrage;  
but she was kept in irons, as they all were, for eight  
months. Her mother addressed an humble but earnest and touching petition to the chief-justice of the  
court at Salem, setting forth her daughter's condition;  
but it was of no avail. Afterwards, she addressed a  
similar memorial to &ldquo;His Excellency Sir William  
Phips, Knight, Governor, and the Honorable Council  
sitting at Boston,&rdquo; in the following terms: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble Petition of Rebecca Fox, of Cambridge, showeth,</hi> that, whereas Rebecca Jacobs (daughter of your humble petitioner) has, a long time, &mdash; even many months, &mdash;  
now lain in prison for witchcraft, and is well known to be a  
<pb n="189" id="vII189"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2194">  
<figDesc>Page 189.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
person crazed, distracted, and broken in mind, your humble  
petitioner does most humbly and earnestly seek unto Your  
Excellency and to Your Honors for relief in this case.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Your petitioner, &mdash; who knows well the condition of her  
poor daughter, &mdash; together with several others of good repute and credit, are ready to offer their oaths, that the said  
Jacobs is a woman crazed, distracted, and broken in her  
mind; and that she has been so these twelve years and  
upwards.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;However, for (I think) above this half-year, the said  
Jacobs has lain in prison, and yet remains there, attended  
with many sore difficulties.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Christianity and nature do each of them oblige your  
petitioner to be very solicitous in this matter; and, although  
many weighty cases do exercise your thoughts, yet your  
petitioner can have no rest in her mind till such time as  
she has offered this her address on behalf of her daughter.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Some have died already in prison, and others have been  
dangerously sick; and how soon others, and, among them,  
my poor child, by the difficulties of this confinement may be  
sick and die, God only knows.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;She is uncapable of making that shift for herself that  
others can do; and such are her circumstances, on other  
accounts, that your petitioner, who is her tender mother, has  
many great sorrows, and almost overcoming burdens, on her  
mind upon her account; but, in the midst of all her perplexities and troubles (next to supplicating to a good and merciful God), your petitioner has no way for help but to make  
this her afflicted condition known unto you. So, not doubting  
but Your Excellency and Your Honors will readily hear the  
cries and groans of a poor distressed woman, and grant what

help and enlargement you may, your petitioner heartily begs  
God's gracious presence with you; and subscribes herself, in  
all humble manner, you sorrowful and distressed petitioner, <hi rend="smallcaps">Rebecca Fox.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>No heed was paid to this petition; and the unfortunate woman remained in jail until &mdash; after the delusion had passed from the minds of the people &mdash; a  
grand jury found a bill against her, on which she  
was brought to trial, Jan. 3, 1693, and acquitted.  
There is no more disgraceful feature in all the proceedings than the long imprisonment of this woman,  
her being brought to trial, and the obdurate deafness  
to humanity and reason of the chief-justice, the governor, and the council.</p>  
<p>No papers are found relating to the examination of  
Thomas Farrar; but the following deposition shows the  
manner in which prosecutions were got up: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> who testifieth and  
saith, that, on the 8th of May, 1692, there appeared to me  
the apparition of an old, gray-headed man, with a great  
nose, which tortured me, and almost choked me, and urged  
me to write in his book; and I asked him what was his  
name, and from whence he came, for I would complain of  
him; and he told me he came from Lynn, and people do call  
him `old Father Pharaoh;' and he said he was my grandfather, for my father used to call him father: but I told him  
I would not call him grandfather; for he was a wizard,  
and I would complain of him. And, ever since, he hath  
afflicted me by times, beating me and pinching me and  
almost choking me, and urging me continually to write in his  
book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, whose names are underwritten, having been conversant with Ann Putnam, have heard her declare what is  
above written, &mdash; what she said she saw and heard from the  
apparition of old Pharaoh, &mdash; and also have seen her tortures, and perceived her hellish temptations, by her loud outcries, `I will not write, old Pharaoh, &mdash; I will not write in  
your book.' <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Putnam,</hi></p>  
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert Morrell.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>She had heard this person spoken of as &ldquo;old Father  
Pharaoh,&rdquo; with his &ldquo;great nose;&rdquo; and, from a mere  
spirit of mischief, &mdash; for the fun of the thing, &mdash; cried  
out upon him. Many of the documents exhibit a levity  
of spirit among these girls, which show how hardened  
and reckless they had become. The following depositions are illustrative of this state of mind among  
them: &mdash;</p>

I asked her why. She said the woods were full of devils,  
and said, `There!' and `There they be!' but I could see  
none. Then I put on my horse; and, after I had ridden  
a while, she told me I might ride softer, for we had outridden  
them. I asked her if she was not afraid of the Devil. She  
answered me, `No: she could discourse with the Devil as well  
as with me,' and further saith not. This I am ready to testify on oath, if called thereto, as witness my hand.</p>

believed she lied, for he saw nothing. Then Goody Ingersoll told the girl she told a lie, for there was nothing. Then  
the girl said she did it for sport, &mdash; they must have some  
sport.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Sarah Buckley was examined May 18, and her daughter Mary Whittredge probably on the same day. We  
have Parris's report of the proceedings in reference to  
the former. The only witnesses against her were the  
afflicted children. They performed their grand operation of going into fits, and being carried to the accused  
and subjected to her touch; Ann Putnam, Susanna  
Sheldon, and Mary Warren enacting the part in succession. Sheldon cried out, &ldquo;There is the black man  
whispering in her ear!&rdquo; The magistrates and all  
beholders were convinced. She was committed to  
prison, and remained in irons for eight months before  
a trial, which resulted in her acquittal. So eminently  
excellent was the character of Goodwife Buckley, that  
her arrest and imprisonment led to expressions in her  
favor as honorable to those who had the courage to  
utter them as to her. The following certificates were  
given, previous to her trial, by ministers in the neighborhood: &mdash;</p>

England, which is above fifty years ago; and, during all that  
time, I never knew nor heard of any evil in her carriage, or  
conversation unbecoming a Christian: likewise, she was  
bred up by Christian parents all the time she lived here at  
Ipswich. I further testify, that the said Sarah was admitted  
as a member into the church of Ipswich above forty years  
since; and that I never heard from others, or observed by  
myself, any thing of her that was inconsistent with her profession or unsuitable to Christianity, either in word, deed,  
or conversation, and am strangely surprised that any person  
should speak or think of her as one worthy to be suspected  
of any such crime that she is now charged with. In testimony hereof I have here set my hand this 20th of June,  
1692. <hi rend="smallcaps">William Hubbard.</hi>&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Being desired by Goodman Buckley to give my testimony to his wife's conversation before this great calamity  
befell her, I cannot refuse to bear witness to the truth; viz.,  
that, during the time of her living in Salem for many years  
in communion with this church, having occasionally frequent converse and discourse with her, I have never observed  
myself, nor heard from any other, any thing that was unsuitable to a conversation becoming the gospel, and have  
always looked upon her as a serious, Godly woman.</p>  
<p rend="right">&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">John Higginson.</hi>&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Marblehead, Jan. 2, 169&frac23;. &mdash; Upon the same request,  
having had the like opportunity by her residence many years  
at Marblehead, I can do no less than give the alike testimony  
for her pious conversation during her abode in this place  
and communion with us. <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel Cheever.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>William Hubbard was the venerable minister of Ipswich, described by Hutchinson as &ldquo;a man of learning,  
<pb n="194" id="vII194"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2199">  
<figDesc>Page 194.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and of a candid and benevolent mind, accompanied  
with a good degree of catholicism.&rdquo; He is described  
by another writer as &ldquo;a man of singular modesty,  
learned without ostentation.&rdquo; He will be remembered with honor for his long and devoted service in  
the Christian ministry, and as the historian of New  
England and of the Indian wars.</p>  
<p>John Higginson was worthy of the title of the  
&ldquo;Nestor of the New-England clergy.&rdquo; He was at this  
time seventy-six years old, and had been a preacher  
of the gospel fifty-five years. For thirty-three years  
he had been pastor of the First Church in Salem, of  
which his father was the first preacher. No character,  
in all our annals, shines with a purer lustre. John  
Dunton visited him in 1686, and thus speaks of him:  
&ldquo;All men look to him as a common father; and old  
age, for his sake, is a reverend thing. He is eminent  
for all the graces that adorn a minister. His very  
presence puts vice out of countenance; his conversation is a glimpse of heaven.&rdquo; The fact, that, while his  
colleague, Nicholas Noyes, took so active and disastrous a part in the prosecutions, he, at an early stage,  
discountenanced them, shows that he was a person of  
discrimination and integrity. That he did not conceal  
his disapprobation of the proceedings is demonstrated,  
not only by the tenor of his attestation in behalf of  
Goodwife Buckley, but by the decisive circumstance  
that the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; cried out against his  
daughter Anna, the wife of Captain William Dolliver,  
of Gloucester; got a warrant to apprehend her; and  
<pb n="195" id="vII195"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2200">  
<figDesc>Page 195.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
had her brought to the Salem jail, and committed as a  
witch. They never struck at friends, but were sure to  
punish all who were suspected to disapprove of the  
proceedings. How long Mrs. Dolliver remained in  
prison we are not informed. But it was impossible to  
break down the influence or independence of Mr.  
Higginson. It is not improbable that he believed in  
witchcraft, with all the other divines of his day; but  
he feared not to bear testimony to personal worth, and  
could not be brought to co-operate in violence, or fall  
in with the spirit of persecution. The weight of his  
character compelled the deference of the most heated  
zealots, and even Cotton Mather himself was eager to  
pay him homage. Four years afterwards, he thus  
writes of him: &ldquo;This good old man is yet alive; and  
he that, from a child, knew the Holy Scriptures, does,  
at those years wherein men use to be twice children,  
continue preaching them with such a manly, pertinent,  
and judicious vigor, and with so little decay of his  
intellectual abilities, as is indeed a matter of just  
admiration.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Samuel Cheever was a clergyman of the highest  
standing, and held in universal esteem through a long  
life.</p>  
<p>From passages incidentally given, it has appeared  
that it was quite common, in those times, to attribute  
accidents, injuries, pains, and diseases of all kinds, to  
an &ldquo;evil hand.&rdquo; It was not confined to this locality.  
When, however, the public mind had become excited  
to so extraordinary a degree by circumstances connected  
<pb n="196" id="vII196"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2201">  
<figDesc>Page 196.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
with the prosecutions in 1692, this tendency of  
the popular credulity was very much strengthened.  
Believing that the sufferer or patient was the victim of  
the malignity of Satan, and it also being a doctrine  
of the established belief that he could not act upon  
human beings or affairs except through the instrumental agency of some other human beings in confederacy with him, the question naturally arose, in  
every specific instance, Who is the person in this diabolical league, and doing the will of the Devil in this  
case? Who is the witch? It may well be supposed,  
that the suffering person, and all surrounding friends,  
would be most earnest and anxious in pressing this  
question and seeking its solution. The accusing girls  
at the village were thought to possess the power to  
answer it. This gave them great importance, gratified their vanity and pride, and exalted them to the  
character of prophetesses. They were ready to meet  
the calls made upon them in this capacity; would be  
carried to the room of a sick person; and, on entering  
it, would exclaim, on the first return of pain, or difficulty of respiration, or restless motion of the patient,  
&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; There is such a one's appearance,  
choking or otherwise tormenting him or her. If the  
minds of the accusing girls had been led towards  
a new victim, his or her name would be used, and a  
warrant issued for his apprehension. If not, then the  
name of some one already in confinement would be  
used on the occasion. It was also a received opinion,  
that, while ordinary fastenings would not prevent a  
<pb n="197" id="vII197"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2202">  
<figDesc>Page 197.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
witch from going abroad, &ldquo;in her apparition,&rdquo; to any  
distance to afflict persons, a redoubling of them might.  
Whenever one of the accusing girls pretended to see  
the spectres of persons already in jail afflicting any  
one, orders would forthwith be given to have them  
more heavily chained. Every once in a while, a  
wretched prisoner, already suffering from bonds and  
handcuffs, would be subjected to additional manacles  
and chains. This was one of the most cruel features  
in these proceedings. It is illustrated by the following document: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Benjamin Hutchinson,</hi> who testifleth and saith, that my wife was much afflicted, presently  
after the last execution, with violent pains in her head and  
teeth, and all parts of her body; but, on sabbath day was  
fortnight in the morning, she being in such excessive misery  
that she said she believed that she had an evil hand upon  
her: whereupon I went to Mary Walcot, one of our next  
neighbors, to come and look to see if she could see anybody  
upon her; and, as soon as she came into the house, she said  
that our two next neighbors, Sarah Buckley and Mary Whittredge, were upon my wife. And immediately my wife had  
ease, and Mary Walcot was tormented. Whereupon I  
went down to the sheriff, and desired him to take some  
course with those women, that they might not have such  
power to torment: and presently he ordered them to be  
fettered, and, ever since that, my wife has been tolerable  
well; and I believe, in my heart, that Sarah Buckley and  
Mary Whittredge have hurt my wife and several others by  
acts of witchcraft.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Benjamin Hutchinson owned the above-written evidence  
<pb n="198" id="vII198"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2203">  
<figDesc>Page 198.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to be the truth, upon oath, before the grand inquest,  
15-7, 1692.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The evidence is quite conclusive, from considerations suggested by the foregoing document, and indications scattered through the papers generally, that  
all persons committed on the charge of witchcraft  
were kept heavily ironed, and otherwise strongly fastened. Only a few of the bills of expenses incurred  
are preserved. Among them we find the following:  
For mending and putting on Rachel Clenton's fetters; one pair of fetters for John Howard; a pair of  
fetters each for John Jackson, Sr., and John Jackson,  
Jr.; eighteen pounds of iron for fetters; for making  
four pair of iron fetters and two pair of handcuffs,  
and putting them on the legs and hands of Goodwife  
Cloyse, Easty, Bromidg, and Green; chains for Sarah  
Good and Sarah Osburn; shackles for ten prisoners;  
and one pair of irons for Mary Cox. When we reflect upon the character of the prisoners generally, &mdash;  
many of them delicate and infirm, several venerable  
for their virtues as well as years, &mdash; and that they  
were kept in this cruelly painful condition from early  
spring to the middle of the next January, and the  
larger part to the May of 1693, in the extremes of heat  
and cold, exposed to the most distressing severities of  
both, crowded in narrow, dark, and noisome jails under an accumulation of all their discomforts, restraints,  
privations, exposures, and abominations, our wonder  
is, not that many of them died, but that all did not  
break down in body and mind.</p>

</p>  
<p>Sarah Buckley and her daughter were not brought  
to trial until after the power of the prosecution to  
pursue to the death had ceased. They were acquitted  
in January, 1692. Their goods and chattels had all  
been seized by the officers, as was the usual practice, at the time of their arrest. In humble circumstances before, it took their last shilling to meet the  
charges of their imprisonment. They, as all others,  
were required to provide their own maintenance  
while in prison; and, after trial and acquittal, were  
not discharged until all costs were paid. Five pounds  
had to be raised, to satisfy the claims of the officers of  
the court and of the jails, for each of them. The result  
was, the family was utterly impoverished. The poor  
old woman, with her aged husband, suffered much,  
there is reason to fear, from absolute want during all  
the rest of their days. Their truly Christian virtues  
dignified their poverty, and secured the respect and  
esteem of all good men. The Rev. Joseph Green has  
this entry in his diary: &ldquo;Jan. 2, 1702. &mdash; Old William  
Buckley died this evening. He was at meeting the  
last sabbath, and died with the cold, I fear, for want  
of comforts and good tending. Lord forgive! He was  
about eighty years old. I visited him and prayed  
with him on Monday, and also the evening before he  
died. He was very poor; but, I hope, had not his  
portion in this life.&rdquo; The ejaculation, &ldquo;Lord forgive!&rdquo; expresses the deep sense Mr. Green had, of  
which his whole ministry gave evidence, of the inexpressible sufferings and wrongs brought upon families  
<pb n="200" id="vII200"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2205">  
<figDesc>Page 200.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
by the witchcraft prosecutions. The case of Sarah  
Buckley, her husband and family, was but one of  
many. The humble, harmless, innocent people who  
experienced that fearful and pitiless persecution had  
to drink of as bitter a cup as ever was permitted by an  
inscrutable Providence to be presented to human lips.  
In reference to them, we feel as an assurance, what  
good Mr. Green humbly hoped, that &ldquo;they had not  
their portion in this life.&rdquo; Those who went firmly,  
patiently, and calmly through that great trial without  
losing love or faith, are crowned with glory and honor.</p>  
<p>The examination and commitment of Mary Easty,  
on the 21st of April, have already been described. For  
some reason, and in a way of which we have no information, she was diseharged from prison on the 18th  
of May, and wholly released. This seems to have  
been very distasteful to the accusing girls. They  
were determined not to let it rest so; and put into  
operation their utmost energies to get her back to imprisonment. On the 20th of May, Mercy Lewis, being  
then at the house of John Putnam, Jr., was taken  
with fits, and experienced tortures of unprecedented  
severity. The particular circumstances on this occasion, as gathered from various depositions, illustrate  
very strikingly the skilful manner in which the girls  
managed to produce the desired effect upon the public  
mind.</p>  
<p>Samuel Abbey, a neighbor, whether sent for or not  
we are not informed, went to John Putnam's house  
that morning, about nine o'clock. He found Mercy in  
<pb n="201" id="vII201"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2206">  
<figDesc>Page 201.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
a terrible condition, crying out with piteous tones of  
anguish, &ldquo;Dear Lord, receive my soul.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Lord, let  
them not kill me quite.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Pray for the salvation of  
my soul, for they will kill me outright.&rdquo; He was desired to go to Thomas Putnam's house to bring his  
daughter Ann, &ldquo;to see if she could see who it was that  
hurt Mercy Lewis.&rdquo; He found Abigail Williams with  
Ann, and they accompanied him back to John Putnam. On the way, they both cried out that they  
saw the apparition of Goody Easty afflicting Mercy  
Lewis. When they reached the scene, they exclaimed,  
&ldquo;There is Goody Easty and John Willard and Mary  
Whittredge afflicting the body of Mercy Lewis;&rdquo; Mercy  
at the time laboring for breath, and appearing as  
choked and strangled, convulsed, and apparently at  
the last gasp. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says Abbey, &ldquo;she continued  
the greatest part of the day, in such tortures as no  
tongue can express.&rdquo; Mary Walcot was sent for.  
Upon coming in, she cried out, &ldquo;There is the apparition of Goody Easty choking Mercy Lewis, pressing  
upon her breasts with both her hands, and putting a  
chain about her neck.&rdquo; A message was then despatched for Elizabeth Hubbard. She, too, saw the  
shape of Goody Easty, &ldquo;the very same woman that  
was sent home the other day,&rdquo; aided in her diabolical  
operations by Willard and Whittredge, &ldquo;torturing  
Mercy in a most dreadful manner.&rdquo; Intelligence of  
the shocking sufferings of Mercy was circulated far  
and wide, and people hurried to the spot from all  
directions. Jonathan Putnam, James Darling, Benjamin  
<pb n="202" id="vII202"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2207">  
<figDesc>Page 202.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Hutchinson, and Samuel Braybrook reached the  
house during the evening, and found Mercy &ldquo;in a case  
as if death would have quickly followed.&rdquo; Occasionally, Mercy would have a respite; and, at such intervals, Elizabeth Hubbard would fill the gap. &ldquo;These  
two fell into fits by turns; the one being well while  
the other was ill.&rdquo; Each of them continued, all the  
while, crying out against Goody Easty, uttering in  
their trances vehement remonstrances against her  
cruel operations, representing her as bringing their  
winding-sheets and coffins, and threatening to kill  
them &ldquo;if they would not sign to her book.&rdquo; Their  
acting was so complete that the bystanders seem to  
have thought that they heard the words of Easty, as  
well as the responses of the girls; and that they saw  
the &ldquo;winding-sheet, coffin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the book.&rdquo; In the  
general consternation, Marshal Herrick was sent for.  
What he saw, heard, thought, and did, appears from  
the following: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;May 20, 1692. &mdash; <hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of George Herrick,</hi> aged thirty-four or thereabouts, and <hi rend="smallcaps">John Putnam,  
Jr.,</hi> of Salem Village, aged thirty-five years or thereabouts. &mdash; Testifieth and saith, that, being at the house of  
the above-said John Putnam, both saw Mercy Lewis in a  
very dreadful and solemn condition, so that to our apprehension she could not continue long in this world without a  
mitigation of those torments we saw her in, which caused  
us to expedite a hasty despatch to apprehend Mary Easty,  
in hopes, if possible, it might save her life; and, returning  
the same night to said John Putnam's house about midnight,  
<pb n="203" id="vII203"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2208">  
<figDesc>Page 203.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
we found the said Mercy Lewis in a dreadful fit, but her  
reason was then returned. Again she said, `What! have  
you brought me the winding-sheet, Goodwife Easty? Well,  
I had rather go into the winding-sheet than set my hand to  
the book;' but, after that, her fits were weaker and weaker,  
but still complaining that she was very sick of her stomach.  
About break of day, she fell asleep, but still continues extremely sick, and was taken with a dreadful fit just as we  
left her; so that we perceived life in her, and that was all.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Edward Putnam, after stating that the grievous  
afflictions and tortures of Mercy Lewis were charged,  
by her and the other four girls, upon Mary Easty,  
deposes as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;I myself, being there present with several others, looked  
for nothing else but present death for almost the space of  
two days and a night. She was choked almost to death,  
insomuch we thought sometimes she had been dead; her  
mouth and teeth shut; and all this very often until such  
time as we understood Mary Easty was laid in irons.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Mercy's fits did not cease immediately upon Easty's  
being apprehended, but on her being committed to  
prison and chains by the magistrate in Salem.</p>  
<p>An examination of distances, with the map before  
us, will show the rapidity with which business was  
despatched on this occasion. Abbey went to John  
Putnam, Jr.'s house at nine o'clock in the morning of  
May 20. He was sent to Thomas Putnam's house for  
Ann, and brought her and Abigail Williams back with  
him. Mary Walcot was sent for to the house of her  
father, Captain Jonathan Walcot, and went up at one  
<pb n="204" id="vII204"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2209">  
<figDesc>Page 204.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
o'clock, &ldquo;about an hour by sun.&rdquo; Then Elizabeth  
Hubbard, who lived at the house of Dr. Griggs, &ldquo;was  
carried up to Constable John Putnam's house:&rdquo;  
Jonathan Putnam, James Darling, Benjamin Hutchinson, and Samuel Braybrook got there in the evening, as  
they say, &ldquo;between eight and eleven o'clock.&rdquo; In the  
mean time, Marshal Herrick had arrived. Steps were  
taken to get out a warrant. John Putnam and Benjamin Hutchinson went to Salem to Hathorne for the  
purpose. They must have started soon after eight.  
Hathorne issued the warrant forthwith. It is dated  
May 20. Herrick went with it to the house of Isaac  
Easty, made the arrest, sent his prisoner to the jail  
in Salem, and returned himself to John Putnam's  
house &ldquo;about midnight;&rdquo; staid to witness the apparently mortal sufferings of Mercy until &ldquo;about break  
of day;&rdquo; returned to Salem; had the examination before Hathorne, at Thomas Beadle's: the whole thing  
was finished, Mary Easty in irons, information of the  
result carried to John Putnam's, and Mercy's agonies  
ceased that afternoon, as Edward Putnam testifies.</p>  
<p>I have given this particular account of the circumstances that led to and attended Mary Easty's second  
arrest, because the papers belonging to the case afford,  
in some respects, a better insight of the state of things  
than others, and because they enable us to realize the  
power which the accusing girls exercised. The continuance of their convulsions and spasms for such a  
length of time, the large number of persons who witnessed and watched them in the broad daylight, and  
<pb n="205" id="vII205"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2210">  
<figDesc>Page 205.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the perfect success of their operations, show how  
thoroughly they had become trained in their arts. I  
have presented the occurrences in the order of time,  
so that, by estimating the distances traversed and the  
period within which they took place, an idea can be  
formed of the vehement earnestness with which men  
acted in the &ldquo;hurrying distractions of amazing afflictions&rdquo; and overwhelming terrors. This instance also  
gives us a view of the horrible state of things, when  
any one, however respectable and worthy, was liable,  
at any moment, to be seized, maligned, and destroyed.</p>  
<p>Mary Easty had previously experienced the malice  
of the persecutors. For two months she had suffered  
the miseries of imprisonment, had just been released,  
and for two days enjoyed the restoration of liberty, the  
comforts of her home, and a re-union with her family.  
She and they, no doubt, considered themselves safe  
from any further outrage. After midnight, she was  
roused from sleep by the unfeeling marshal, torn from  
her husband and children, carried back to prison,  
loaded with chains, and finally consigned to a dreadful  
and most cruel death. She was an excellent and  
pious matron. Her husband, referring to the transaction nearly twenty years afterwards, justly expressed  
what all must feel, that it was &ldquo;a hellish molestation.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>One of the most malignant witnesses against Mary  
Easty was &ldquo;Goodwife Bibber.&rdquo; She obtruded herself  
in many of the cases, acting as a sort of outside member of the &ldquo;accusing circle,&rdquo; volunteering her aid in  
<pb n="206" id="vII206"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2211">  
<figDesc>Page 206.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
carrying on the persecutions. It was an outrage for  
the magistrates or judges to have countenanced such  
a false defamer. There are, among the papers,  
documents which show that she ought to have been  
punished as a calumniator, rather than be called to  
utter, under oath, lies against respectable people. The  
following deposition was sworn to in Court: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Joseph Fowler,</hi> who testifieth that  
Goodman Bibber and his wife lived at my house; and I did  
observe and take notice that Goodwife Bibber was a woman  
who was very idle in her calling, and very much given to  
tattling and tale-bearing, making mischief amongst her  
neighbors, and very much given to speak bad words, and  
would call her husband bad names, and was a woman of a  
very turbulent, unruly spirit.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Joseph Fowler lived in Wenham, and was a person  
of respectability and influence. His brother Philip  
was also a leading man; was employed as attorney  
by the Village Parish in its lawsuit with Mr. Parris;  
and married a sister of Joseph Herrick. They were  
the grandsons of the first Philip, who was an early  
emigrant from Wales, settling in Ipswich, where he  
had large landed estates. Henry Fowler and his two  
brothers, now of Danvers, are the descendants of this  
family: one of them, Augustus, distinguished as a  
naturalist, especially in the department of ornithology;  
the other, Samuel Page Fowler, as an explorer of our  
early annals and local antiquities. In 1692, one of  
the Fowlers conducted the proceedings in Court  
<pb n="207" id="vII207"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2212">  
<figDesc>Page 207.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
against the head and front of the witchcraft prosecution; and the other had the courage, in the most  
fearful hour of the delusion, to give open testimony in  
the defence of its victims. It is an interesting circumstance, that one of the same name and descent, in his  
reprint of the papers of Calef and in other publications, has done as much as any other person of our  
day to bring that whole transaction under the light of  
truth and justice.</p>

<p>John Porter, who was a grandson of the original  
John Porter and the original William Dodge and a  
man of property and family, with his wife Lydia;  
Thomas Jacobs and Mary his wife; and Richard Walker, &mdash; all of Wenham, and for a long time neighbors of  
this Bibber, &mdash; testify, in corroboration of the statement  
of Fowler, that she was a woman of an unruly, turbulent spirit, double-tongued, much given to tattling  
and tale-bearing, making mischief amongst her neighbors, very much given to speak bad words, often  
speaking against one and another, telling lies and  
uttering malicious wishes against people. It was  
abundantly proved that she had long been known to be  
able to fall into fits at any time. One witness said  
&ldquo;she would often fall into strange fits when she was  
crossed of her humor;&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;that she could  
fall into fits as often as she pleased.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>On the 21st of May, warrants were issued against  
the wife of William Basset, of Lynn; Susanna Roots, of  
Beverly; and Sarah, daughter of John Procter of Salem  
Farms; a few days after, against Benjamin, a son of

said John Procter; Mary Derich, wife of Michael Derich, and daughter of William Basset of Lynn; and the  
wife of Robert Pease of Salem. Such papers as relate  
to these persons vary in no particular worthy of notice  
from those already presented.</p>  
<p>On the 28th of May, warrants were issued against  
Martha Carrier, of Andover; Elizabeth Fosdick, of Malden; Wilmot Read, of Marblehead; Sarah Rice, of  
Reading; Elizabeth How, of Topsfield; Captain John  
Alden, of Boston; William Procter, of Salem Farms;  
Captain John Flood, of Rumney Marsh; &mdash; Toothaker and her daughter, of Billerica; and &mdash; Abbot,  
between Topsfield and Wenham line. On the 30th,  
a warrant was issued against Elizabeth, wife of Stephen Paine, of Charlestown; on the 4th of June,  
against Mary, wife of Benjamin Ireson, of Lynn. Besides these, there are notices of complaints made and  
warrants issued against a great number of people in  
all parts of the country: Mary Bradbury, of Salisbury;  
Lydia and Sarah Dustin, of Reading; Ann Sears, of  
Woburn; Job Tookey, of Beverly; Abigail Somes, of  
Gloucester; Elizabeth Carey, of Charlestown; Candy,  
a negro woman; and many others. Some of them have  
points of interest, demanding particular notice.</p>  
<p>The case of Martha Carrier has some remarkable  
features. It has been shown, by passages already  
adduced, that every idle rumor; every thing that the  
gossip of the credulous or the fertile imaginations of  
the malignant could produce; every thing, gleaned from  
the memory or the fancy, that could have an unfavorable

bearing upon an accused person, however foreign  
or irrelevant it might be to the charge, was allowed to  
be brought in evidence before the magistrates, and received at the trials. We have seen that a child under  
five years of age was arrested, and put into prison.  
Children were not only permitted, but induced, to  
become witnesses against their parents, and parents  
against their children. Husbands and wives were  
made to criminate each other as witnesses in court.  
When Martha Carrier was arrested, four of her children were also taken into custody. An indictment  
against one of them is among the papers. Under the  
terrors brought to bear upon them, they were prevailed  
on to be confessors. The following shows how these  
children were trained to tell their story:&mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;It was asked Sarah Carrier by the magistrates, &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How long hast thou been a witch? &mdash; Ever since I was  
six years old.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How old are you now? &mdash; Near eight years old: brother Richard says I shall be eight years old in November  
next.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who made you a witch? &mdash; My mother: she made me  
set my hand to a book.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How did you set your hand to it? &mdash; I touched it with  
my fingers, and the book was red: the paper of it was  
white.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;She said she never had seen the black man: the place  
where she did it was in Andrew Foster's pasture, and Elizabeth Johnson, Jr., was there. Being asked who was there  
besides, she answered, her aunt Toothaker and her cousin.  
<pb n="210" id="vII210"/>

Being asked when it was, she said, when she was baptized.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did they promise to give you? &mdash; A black dog.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did the dog ever come to you? &mdash; No.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;But you said you saw a cat once: what did that say to  
you? &mdash; It said it would tear me in pieces, if I would not set  
my hand to the book.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;She said her mother baptized her, and the Devil, or  
black man, was not there, as she saw; and her mother  
said, when she baptized her, `Thou art mine for ever and  
ever. Amen.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How did you afflict folks? &mdash; I pinched them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And she said she had no puppets, but she went to them  
that she afflicted. Being asked whether she went in her  
body or her spirit, she said in her spirit. She said her  
mother carried her thither to afflict.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How did your mother carry you when she was in  
prison? &mdash; She came like a black cat.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How did you know it was your mother? &mdash; The cat told  
me so, that she was my mother. She said she afflicted  
Phelps's child last Saturday, and Elizabeth Johnson joined  
with her to do it. She had a wooden spear, about as long  
as her finger, of Elizabeth Johnson; and she had it of the  
Devil. She would not own that she had ever been at the  
witch-meeting at the village. This is the substance.</p>

<p>The confession of another of her children is among  
the papers. It runs thus: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Have you been in the Devil's snare? &mdash; Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Is your brother Andrew ensnared by the Devil's snare?  
&mdash; Yes.</p>

</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How long has your brother been a witch? &mdash; Near a  
month.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a witch? &mdash; Not long.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Have you joined in afflicting the afflicted persons? &mdash;  
Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;You helped to hurt Timothy Swan, did you? &mdash; Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a witch? &mdash; About five  
weeks.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who was in company when you covenanted with the  
Devil? &mdash; Mrs. Bradbury.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did she help you afflict? &mdash; Yes.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Who was at the village meeting when you were there?  
&mdash; Goodwife How, Goodwife Nurse, Goodwife Wildes, Procter and his wife, Mrs. Bradbury, and Corey's wife.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did they do there? &mdash; Eat, and drank wine.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Was there a minister there? &mdash; No, not as I know of.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;From whence had you your wine? &mdash; From Salem, I  
think, it was.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Goodwife Oliver there? &mdash; Yes: I knew her.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>In concluding his report of the trial of this wretched  
woman, whose children were thus made to become the  
instruments for procuring her death, Dr. Cotton Mathjer expresses himself in the following language: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;This rampant hag (Martha Carrier) was the person of  
whom the confessions of the witches, and of her own children  
among the rest, agreed that the Devil had promised her that  
she should be queen of Hell.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It is quite evident that this &ldquo;rampant hag&rdquo; had no  
better opinion of the dignitaries and divines who  
managed matters at the time than they had of her.  
<pb n="212" id="vII212"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2217">  
<figDesc>Page 212.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
The record of her examination shows that she was not  
afraid to speak her mind, and in plain terms too.  
When brought before the magistrates, the following  
were their questions and her answers. The accusing  
witnesses having severally made their charges against  
her, declaring that she had tormented them in various  
ways, and threatened to cut their throats if they would  
not sign the Devil's book, which, they said, she had  
presented to them, the magistrates addressed her in  
these words: &ldquo;What do you say to this you are  
charged with?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I have not done it.&rdquo;  
One of the accusers cried out that she was, at that  
moment, sticking pins into her. Another declared  
that she was then looking upon &ldquo;the black man,&rdquo; &mdash;  
the shape in which they pretended the Devil appeared.  
The magistrate asked the accused, &ldquo;What black man is  
that?&rdquo; Her answer was, &ldquo;I know none.&rdquo; The accusers  
cried out that the black man was present, and visible  
to them. The magistrate asked her, &ldquo;What black  
man did you see?&rdquo; Her answer was, &ldquo;I saw no black  
man but your own presence.&rdquo; Whenever she looked  
upon the accusers, they were knocked down. The  
magistrate, entirely deluded by their practised acting,  
said to her, &ldquo;Can you look upon these, and not knock  
them down?&rdquo; Her answer was, &ldquo;They will dissemble, if I look upon them.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;You see,  
you look upon them, and they fall down.&rdquo; She broke  
out, &ldquo;It is false: the Devil is a liar. I looked upon  
none since I came into the room but you.&rdquo; Susanna  
Sheldon cried out, in a trance, &ldquo;I wonder what could  
<pb n="213" id="vII213"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2218">  
<figDesc>Page 213.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
you murder thirteen persons for.&rdquo; At this, her spirit  
became aroused: the accusers fell into the most intolerable outcries and agonies. The accused rebuked  
the magistrate, charging him with unfairness in not  
paying any regard to what she said, and receiving  
every thing that the accusers said. &ldquo;It is a shameful  
thing, that you should mind these folks that are out of  
their wits;&rdquo; and, turning to those who were bringing  
these false and ridiculous charges against her, she said,  
&ldquo;You lie: I am wronged.&rdquo; The energy and courage  
of the prisoner threw the accusers, magistrates, and  
the whole crowd into confusion and uproar. The record closes the description of the scene in these words:  
&ldquo;The tortures of the afflicted were so great that there  
was no enduring of it, so that she was ordered away,  
and to be bound hand and foot with all expedition; the  
afflicted, in the mean while, almost killed, to the great  
trouble of all spectators, magistrates, and others.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Parris closes his report of this examination as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Note.</hi> &mdash; As soon as she was well bound, they all had  
strange and sudden ease. Mary Walcot told the magistrates that this woman told her she had been a witch this  
forty years.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This shows the sort of communications the girls  
were allowed to hold with the magistrates, exciting  
their prejudices against accused persons, and filling  
their ears with all sorts of exaggerated and false  
stories. However much she may have been maligned  
<pb n="214" id="vII214"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2219">  
<figDesc>Page 214.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
by her neighbors, some of whom had long been in the  
habit of circulating slanders against her, the whole  
tenor of the papers relating to her shows that she  
always indignantly repelled the charge of being a  
witch, and was the last person in the world to have  
volunteered such a statement as Mary Walcot reported.</p>  
<p>The examination of Martha Carrier must have been  
one of the most striking scenes of the whole drama of  
the witchcraft proceedings. The village meeting-house  
presented a truly wild and exciting spectacle. The  
fearful and horrible superstition which darkened the  
minds of the people was displayed in their aspect and  
movements. Their belief, that, then and there, they  
were witnessing the great struggle between the kingdoms of God and of the Evil One, and that every thing  
was at stake on the issue, gave an awe-struck intensity  
to their expression. The blind, unquestioning confidence of the magistrates, clergy, and all concerned in  
the prosecutions, in the evidence of the accusers; the  
loud outcries of their pretended sufferings; their contortions, swoonings, and tumblings, excited the usual  
consternation in the assembly. In addition to this,  
there was the more than ordinary bold and defiant  
bearing of the prisoner, stung to desperation by the  
outrage upon human nature in the abuse practised  
upon her poor children; her firm and unshrinking  
courage, facing the tempest that was raised to overwhelm her, sternly rebuking the magistrates, &mdash; &ldquo;It  
is a shameful thing that you should mind these folks  
<pb n="215" id="vII215"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2220">  
<figDesc>Page 215.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that are out of their wits;&rdquo; &mdash; her whole demeanor,  
proclaiming her conscious innocence, and proving that  
she chose chains, the dungeon, and the scaffold, rather  
than to belie herself. Seldom has a scene in real life,  
or a picture wrought by the inspiration of genius and the  
hand of art, in its individual characters or its general  
grouping, surpassed that presented on this occasion.</p>  
<p>Hutchinson has preserved the record of another  
examination of a different character. An ignorant  
negro slave-woman was brought before the magistrates. She was cunning enough, not only to confess,  
but to cover herself with the cloak of having been led  
into the difficulty by her mistress.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Candy, are you a witch? &mdash; Candy no witch in her  
country. Candy's mother no witch. Candy no witch, Barbados. This country, mistress give Candy witch.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Did your mistress make you a witch in this country? &mdash;  
Yes: in this country, mistress give Candy witch.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;What did your mistress do to make you witch? &mdash;  
Mistress bring book and pen and ink; make Candy write  
in it.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Upon being asked what she wrote, she took a pen  
and ink, and made a mark. Upon being asked how  
she afflicted people, and where were the puppets she  
did it with, she said, that, if they would let her go out  
for a moment, she would show them how. They allowed her to go out, and she presently returned with  
two pieces of cloth or linen, &mdash; one with two knots,  
the other with one tied in it. Immediately on seeing  
these articles, the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; were &ldquo;greatly  
<pb n="216" id="vII216"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2221">  
<figDesc>Page 216.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
affrighted,&rdquo; and fell into violent fits. When they  
came to, they declared that the &ldquo;black man,&rdquo; Mrs.  
Hawkes, and the negro, stood by the puppets of rags,  
and pinched them. Whereupon they fell into fits  
again. &ldquo;A bit of one of the rags being set on fire,&rdquo;  
they all shricked that they were burned, and &ldquo;cried  
out dreadfully.&rdquo; Some pieces being dipped in water,  
they went into the convulsions and struggles of drowning persons; and one of them rushed out of the room,  
and raced down towards the river.</p>  
<p>Candy and the girls having played their parts so  
well, there was no escape for poor Mrs. Hawkes but in  
confession, which she forthwith made. They were  
both committed to prison. Fortunately, it was not  
convenient to bring them to trial until the next January, when, the delusion having blown over, they were  
acquitted.</p>  
<p>Besides those already mentioned, there were others,  
among the victims of this delusion, whose cases excite  
our tenderest sensibility, and deepen our horror in the  
contemplation of the scene. It seems, that, some time  
before the transactions took place in Salem Village, a  
difficulty arose between two families on the borders of  
Topsfield and Ipswich, such as often occur among  
neighbors, about some small matter of property,  
fences, or boundaries. Their names were Perley and  
How. A daughter of Perley, about ten years of age,  
hearing, probably, strong expressions by her parents,  
became excited against the Hows, and charged the  
wife of How with bewitching her. She acted much  
<pb n="217" id="vII217"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2222">  
<figDesc>Page 217.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
after the manner of the &ldquo;afflicted girls&rdquo; in Salem  
Village, which was near the place of her residence.  
Very soon the idea became current that Mrs. How  
was a witch; and every thing that happened amiss to  
any one was laid at her door. She was cried out  
against by the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; in Salem Village,  
and carried before the magistrates for examination on  
the 31st of May, 1692. Upon being brought into her  
presence, the accusers fell into their usual fits and  
convulsions, and charged her with tormenting them.  
To the question, put by the magistrates, &ldquo;What say  
you to this charge?&rdquo; her answer was, &ldquo;If it was the  
last moment I was to live, God knows I am innocent  
of any thing in this nature.&rdquo; The papers connected  
with her trial bear abundant testimony to the excellent character of this pious and amiable woman. A  
person, who had lived near her twenty-four years,  
states, in her deposition, &ldquo;that she had found her a  
neighborly woman, conscientious in her dealing, faithful to her promises, and Christianlike in her conversation.&rdquo; Several others join in a deposition to this  
effect: &ldquo;For our own parts, we have been well acquainted with her for above twenty years. We never  
saw but that she carried it very well, and that both  
her words and actions were always such as well became a good Christian.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The following passages illustrate the wicked arts  
sometimes used to bring accusations upon innocent  
persons, and give affecting proof of the excellence of  
the character and heart of Elizabeth How: &mdash;</p>

<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Samuel Phillips,</hi> aged about sixtyseven, minister of the word of God in Rowley, who saith that  
Mr. Payson  
(minister of God's word also in Rowley) and  
myself went, being desired, to Samuel Perly, of Ipswich,  
to see their young daughter, who was visited with strange  
fits; and, in her fits (as her father and mother affirmed),  
did mention Goodwife How, the wife of James How, Jr.,  
of Ipswich, as if she was in the house, and did afflict her.  
When we were in the house, the child had one of her fits,  
but made no mention of Goodwife How; and, when the  
fit was over, and she came to herself, Goodwife How went  
to the child, and took her by the hand, and asked her  
whether she had ever done her any hurt; and she answered,  
`No, never; and, if I did complain of you in my fits, I  
knew not that I did so.' I further can affirm, upon oath,  
that young Samuel Perley, brother to the afflicted girl,  
looked out of a chamber window (I and the afflicted child  
being without doors together), and said to his sister, `Say  
Goodwife How is a witch, &mdash; say she is a witch;' and the  
child spake not a word that way. But I looked up to  
the window where the youth stood, and rebuked him for his  
boldness to stir up his sister to accuse the said Goodwife  
How; whereas she had cleared her from doing any hurt to  
his sister in both our hearing; and I added, `No wonder  
that the child, in her fits, did mention Goodwife How, when  
her nearest relations were so frequent in expressing their  
suspicions, in the child's hearing, when she was out of her  
fits, that the said Goodwife How was an instrument of mischief to the child.&rdquo;'</p></q>  
<p>Mr. Payson, in reference to the same occasion, deposed as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="219" id="vII219"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2224">  
<figDesc>Page 219.</figDesc>

</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Being in Perley's house some considerable time before  
the said Goodwife How came in, their afflicted daughter  
upon something that her mother spake to her with <unclear></unclear>  
presently fell into one of her usual strange fits, during <unclear></unclear>  
she made no mention (as I observed) of the abovesaid <unclear></unclear>  
her name, or any thing relating to her. Some time after, <unclear></unclear>  
said How came in, when said girl had recovered her capacity, her fit being over. Said How took said girl by <unclear></unclear>  
hand, and asked her whether she had ever done her <unclear></unclear>  
hurt. The child answered, `No; never,' with several expressions to that purpose.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The bearing of Elizabeth How, under <unclear></unclear>  
so cruelly and shamefully fabricated and <unclear></unclear>  
against her, exhibits one of the most beautiful <unclear></unclear>  
tures of a truly forgiving spirit and of <unclear></unclear>  
love anywhere to be found. Several witnesses <unclear></unclear>  
&ldquo;We often spoke to her of some things that <unclear></unclear>  
reported of her, that gave some suspicion of that <unclear></unclear>  
is now charged with; and she, always professing <unclear></unclear>  
innocency, often desired our prayers to God for <unclear></unclear>  
that God would keep her in his fear, and <unclear></unclear>  
her under her burden. We have often heard <unclear></unclear>  
speaking of those persons that raised those reports <unclear></unclear>  
her, and we never heard her speak badly of them <unclear></unclear>  
the same; but, in our hearing, hath often said <unclear></unclear>  
she desired God that he would sanctify that <unclear></unclear>  
as well as others, for her spiritual good.&rdquo; Others <unclear></unclear>  
tified to the same effect. Simon Chapman, and <unclear></unclear>  
his wife, say that &ldquo;they had been acquainted with <unclear></unclear>  
wife of James How, Jr., as a neighbor, for this <unclear></unclear>

ten years;&rdquo; that they had resided in the same house  
with her &ldquo;by the fortnight together;&rdquo; that they never  
knew any thing but what was good in her. They  
&ldquo;found, at all times, by her discourse, she was a  
woman of afflication, and mourning for sin in herself  
and others; and, when she met with any affliction, she  
seemed to justify God and say that it was all better  
than she deserved, though it was by false accusations  
from men. She used to bless God that she got good  
by affliction; for it made her examine her own heart.  
We never heard her revile any person that hath accused her with witchcraft, but pitied them, and said,  
`I pray God forgive them; for they harm themselves  
more than me. Though I am a great sinner, I am  
clear of that; and such kind of affliction doth but  
set me to examining my own heart, and I find God  
wonderfully supporting me and comforting me by his  
word and promises.&rdquo;'</p>  
<p>Joseph Knowlton and his wife Mary, who had lived  
near her, and sometimes in the same family with her,  
testified, that, having heard the stories told about  
her, they were led to &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;take special notice of her life and conversation ever since.  
And I have asked her if she could freely forgive them that  
raised such reports of her. She told me yes, with all her  
heart, desiring that God would give her a heart to be more  
humble under such a providence; and, further, she said she  
was willing to do any good she could to those who had done  
unneighborly by her. Also this I have taken notice, that she  
would deny herself to do a neighbor a good turn.&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>The father of her husband, &mdash; James How, Sr., aged  
about ninety-four years, &mdash; in a communication addressed to the Court, declared that &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;he, living by her for about thirty years, hath taken notice  
that she hath carried it well becoming her place, as a daughter, as a wife, in all relations, setting aside human infirmities, as becometh a Christian; with respect to myself as a  
father, very dutifully; and as a wife to my son, very careful,  
loving, obedient, and kind, &mdash; considering his want of eyesight, tenderly leading him about by the hand. Desiring  
God may guide your honors,... I rest yours to serve.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The only evidence against this good woman &mdash; be  
yond the outcries and fits of the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo;  
enacted in their usual skilful and artful style &mdash; consisted of the most wretched gossip ever circulated in  
an ignorant and benighted community. It came from  
people in the back settlements of Ipswich and Topsfield, and disclosed a depth of absurd and brutal superstition, which it is difficult to believe ever existed in  
New England. So far as those living in secluded  
and remote localities are regarded, this was the most  
benighted period of our history. Except where, as  
in Salem Village, special circumstances had kept up  
the general intelligence, there was much darkness  
on the popular mind. The education that came over  
with the first emigrants from the mother-country had  
gone with them to their graves. The system of common schools had not begun to produce its fruit in  
the thinly peopled outer settlements. There is no  
more disgraceful page in our annals than that which

<figure entity="Uphv2227">  
<figDesc>Page 222.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
details the testimony given at the trial, and records the  
conviction and execution, of Elizabeth How.</p>  
<p>But the dark shadows of that day of folly, cruelty,  
and crime, served to bring into a brighter and purer  
light virtues exhibited by many persons. We meet  
affecting instances, all along, of family fidelity and  
true Christian benevolence. James How, as has been  
stated, was stricken with blindness. He had two  
daughters, Mary and Abigail. Although their farm  
was out of the line of the public-roads, travel very difficult, and they must have encountered many hardships,  
annoyances, and, it is to be feared, sometimes unfeeling  
treatment by the way, one of them accompanied their  
father, twice every week, to visit their mother in her  
prison-walls. They came on horseback; she managing the bridle, and guiding him by the hand after  
alighting. Their humble means were exhausted in  
these offices of reverence and affection. One of the  
noble girls made her way to Boston, sought out the  
Governor, and implored a reprieve for her mother;  
but in vain. The sight of these young women, leading  
their blind father to comfort and provide for their  
&ldquo;honored mother, &mdash; as innocent,&rdquo; as they declared  
her to be, &ldquo;of the crime charged, as any person in the  
world,&rdquo; &mdash; so faithful and constant in their filial love  
and duty, relieved the horrors of the scene; and it  
ought to be held in perpetual remembrance. The  
shame of that day is not, and will not be, forgotten;  
neither should its beauty and glory.</p>  
<p>The name of Elizabeth How, before marriage, was

Jackson. Among the accounts rendered against the  
country for expenses incurred in the witchcraft prosecutions are these two items: &ldquo;For John Jackson, Sr.,  
one pair of fetters, five shillings; for John Jackson,  
Jr., one pair of fetters, five shillings.&rdquo; There is also  
an item for carrying &ldquo;the two Jacksons&rdquo; from one  
jail to another, and back again. No other reference to  
them is found among the papers. They were, perhaps, a brother and nephew of Elizabeth How. There  
is reason to suppose that her husband, James How,  
Jr., was a nephew of the Rev. Francis Dane, of Andover.</p>  
<p>The examination of Job Tookey, of Beverly, presents  
some points worthy of notice. He is described as  
a &ldquo;laborer,&rdquo; but was evidently a person, although perhaps inconsiderate of speech, of more than common  
discrimination, and not wholly deluded by the fanaticism of the times. He is charged with having said  
that he &ldquo;would take Mr. Burroughs's part;&rdquo; &ldquo;that  
he was not the Devil's servant, but the Devil was his.&rdquo;  
When the girls testified that they saw his shape afflicting persons, he answered, like a sensible man, if they  
really saw any such thing, &ldquo;it was not he, but the  
Devil in his shape, that hurts the people.&rdquo; Susanna  
Sheldon, Mary Warren, and Ann Putnam, all declared, that, at that very moment while the examination was going on, two men and two women and one  
child &ldquo;rose from the dead, and cried, `Vengeance!  
vengeance!&rdquo;' Nobody else saw or heard any thing:  
but the girls suddenly became dumb; their eyes were

<figure entity="Uphv2229">  
<figDesc>Page 224.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fixed on vacancy, all looking towards the same spot;  
and their whole appearance gave assurance of the  
truth of what they said. In a short time, Mary Warren recovered the use of her vocal organs, and exclaimed, &ldquo;There are three men, and three women, and  
two children. They are all in their winding-sheets:  
they look pale upon us, but red upon Tookey, &mdash; red as  
blood.&rdquo; Again, she exclaimed, in a startled and  
affrighted manner, &ldquo;There is a young child under the  
table, crying out for vengeance.&rdquo; Elizabeth Booth,  
pointing to the same place, was struck speechless.  
In this way, the murder of about every one who had  
died at Royal Side, for a year or two past, was put  
upon Tookey. Some of them were called by name;  
the others, the girls pretended not to recognize. The  
wrath and horror of the whole community were excited against him, and he was committed to jail, by the  
order of the magistrates, &mdash; Bartholomew Gedney,  
Jonathan Corwin, and John Hathorne.</p>  
<p>No character, indeed, however blameless lovely or  
venerable, was safe. The malignant accusers struck  
at the highest marks, and the consuming fire of popular frenzy was kindled and attracted towards the most  
commanding objects. Mary Bradbury is described, in  
the indictment against her, as the &ldquo;wife of Captain  
Thomas Bradbury, of Salisbury, in the county of Essex, gentleman.&rdquo; A few of the documents that are  
preserved, belonging to her case, will give some idea  
what sort of a person she was: &mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do plead `Not guilty.' I am wholly innocent of any  
such wickedness, through the goodness of God that have kept  
me hitherto. I am the servant of Jesus Christ, and have  
given myself up to him as my only Lord and Saviour, and to  
the diligent attendance upon him in all his holy ordinances, in  
utter contempt and defiance of the Devil and all his works, as  
horrid and detestable, and, accordingly, have endeavored to  
frame my life and conversation according to the rules of his  
holy word; and, in that faith and practice, resolve, by the  
help and assistance of God, to continue to my life's end.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;For the truth of what I say, as to matter of practice, I  
humbly refer myself to my brethren and neighbors that know  
me, and unto the Searcher of all hearts, for the truth and  
uprightness of my heart therein (human frailties and unavoidable infirmities excepted, of which I bitterly complain  
every day). <hi rend="smallcaps">Mary Bradbury.</hi>&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;July 28, 1692. &mdash; Concerning my beloved wife, Mary  
Bradbury, this is what I have to say: We have been married  
fifty-five years, and she hath been a loving and faithful wife  
to me. Unto this day, she hath been wonderful laborious,  
diligent, and industrious, in her place and employment, about  
the bringing-up of our family (which have been eleven children of our own, and four grandchildren). She was both  
prudent and provident, of a cheerful spirit, liberal and charitable. She being now very aged and weak, and grieved  
under her affliction, may not be able to speak much for herself, not being so free of speech as some others may be.  
I hope her life and conversation have been such amongst her

neighbors as gives a better and more real testimony of her  
than can be expressed by words.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Owned by me, <hi rend="smallcaps">Tho. Bradbury.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The Rev. James Allin made oath before Robert Pike,  
an assistant and magistrate, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;I, having lived nine years at Salisbury in the work of  
the ministry, and now four years in the office of a pastor, to  
my best notice and observation of Mrs. Bradbury, she hath  
lived according to the rules of the gospel amongst us; was a  
constant attender upon the ministry of the word, and all the  
ordinances of the gospel; full of works of charity and mercy  
to the sick and poor: neither have I seen or heard any thing  
of her unbecoming the profession of the gospel.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Robert Pike also affirmed to the truth of Mr. Allin's  
statement, from &ldquo;upwards of fifty years' experience,&rdquo;  
as did John Pike also: they both declared themselves  
ready and desirous to give their testimony before the  
Court.</p>  
<p>One hundred and seventeen of her neighbors &mdash; the  
larger part of them heads of families, and embracing  
the most respectable people of that vicinity &mdash; signed  
their names to a paper, of which the following is a  
copy: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Concerning Mrs. Bradbury's life and conversation, we,  
the subscribers, do testify, that it was such as became the  
gospel: she was a lover of the ministry, in all appearance,  
and a diligent attender upon God's holy ordinances, being of  
a courteous and peaceable disposition and carriage. Neither  
did any of us (some of whom have lived in the town with her

</figure>  
above fifty years) ever hear or ever know that she ever had  
any difference or falling-out with any of her neighbors, &mdash;  
man, woman, or child, &mdash; but was always ready and willing  
to do for them what lay in her power night and day, though  
with hazard of her health, or other danger. More might be  
spoken in her commendation, but this for the present.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Although this aged matron and excellent Christian  
lady was convicted and sentenced to death, it is most  
satisfactory to find that she escaped from prison, and  
her life was saved.</p>  
<p>The following facts show the weight which ought to  
have been attached to these statements. The position,  
as well as character and age, of Mary [Perkins] Bradbury entitled her to the highest consideration, in the  
structure of society at that time. This is recognized  
in the title &ldquo;Mrs.,&rdquo; uniformly given her. She had  
been noted, through life, for business capacity, energy,  
and influence; and, in 1692, was probably seventy-five  
years of age, and somewhat infirm in health. Her  
husband, Thomas Bradbury, had been a prominent  
character in the colony for more than fifty years. In  
1641, he was appointed, by the General Court, Clerk of  
the Writs for Salisbury, with the functions of a magistrate, to execute all sorts of legal processes in that  
place. He was a deputy in 1651 and many subsequent years; a commissioner for Salisbury in 1657,  
empowered to act in all criminal cases, and bind over  
offenders, where it was proper, to higher courts, to  
take testimonies upon oath, and to join persons in  
marriage. He was required to keep a record of all his  
<pb n="228" id="vII228"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2233">  
<figDesc>Page 228.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
doings. If the parties agreed to that effect, he was  
authorized to hear and determine cases of every kind  
and degree, without the intervention of a jury. The  
towns north of the Merrimac, and all beyond now  
within the limits of New Hampshire, constituted the  
County of Norfolk; and Thomas Bradbury, for a long  
series of years, was one of its commissioners and associate judges. From the first, he was conspicuous  
in military matters; having been commissioned by the  
General Court, in 1648, Ensign of the trainband in  
Salisbury. He rose to its command; and, in the latter  
portion of his life, was universally spoken of as &ldquo;Captain Bradbury.&rdquo; All along, the records of the General  
Court, for half a century, demonstrate the estimation  
in which he was held; various important trusts  
and special services requiring integrity and ability  
being from time to time committed to him. His  
family was influentially connected. His son William  
married the widow of Samuel Maverick, Jr., who was  
the son of one of the King's Commissioners in 1664.  
she was the daughter of the Rev. John Wheelwright,  
a man of great note, intimately related to the celebrated Anne Hutchinson, and united with her by  
sympathy in sentiment and participation in exile.</p>  
<p>Robert Pike, born in 1616, was a magistrate in 1644.  
He was deputy from Salisbury in 1648, and many  
times after; Associate Justice for Norfolk in 1650;  
and Assistant in 1682, holding that high station, by  
annual elections, to the close of the first charter, and  
during the whole period of the intervening and insurgent  
<pb n="229" id="vII229"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2234">  
<figDesc>Page 229.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
government. He was named as one of the  
council that succeeded to the House of Assistants,  
when, under the new charter, Massachusetts became  
a royal province. He was always at the head of  
military affairs, having been commissioned, by the  
General Court, Lieutenant of the Salisbury trainband  
in 1648; and, in the later years of his life, he held the  
rank and title of major. John Pike, probably his son,  
resided in Hampton in 1691, and was minister of  
Dover at his death in 1710.</p>  
<p>Surely, the attestations of such men as the Pikes,  
father and son, and the Rev. James Allin, to the  
Christian excellence of Mary Bradbury, must be allowed to corroborate fully the declarations of her  
neighbors, her husband, and herself.</p>  
<p>The motives and influences that led to her arrest and  
condemnation in 1692 demand an explanation. The  
question arises, Why should the attention of the accusing girls have been led to this aged and most respectable woman, living at such a distance, beyond the  
Merrimac? A critical scrutiny of the papers in  
the case affords a clew leading to the true answer.</p>  
<p>The wife of Sergeant Thomas Putnam, as has been  
stated (vol. i. p. 253), was Ann Carr of Salisbury.  
Her father, George Carr, was an early settler in that  
place, and appears to have been an enterprising and  
prosperous person. The ferry for the main travel of  
the country across the Merrimac was from points  
of land owned by him, and always under his charge.  
He was engaged in ship-building, &mdash; employing, and  
<pb n="230" id="vII230"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2235">  
<figDesc>Page 230.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
having in his family, young men; among them a son of  
Zerubabel Endicott, bearing the same name.</p>  
<p>Among the papers in the case is the following: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Richard Carr,</hi> who testifieth and  
saith, that, about thirteen years ago, presently after some  
difference that happened to be between my honored father,  
Mr. George Carr, and Mrs. Bradbury, the prisoner at the bar,  
upon a sabbath at noon, as we were riding home, by the  
house of Captain Tho: Bradbury, I saw Mrs. Bradbury go  
into her gate, turn the corner of, and immediately there  
darted out of her gate a blue boar, and darted at my father's  
horse's legs, which made him stumble; but I saw it no more.  
And my father said, `Boys, what do you see?' We both  
answered, `A blue boar.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Zerubabel Endicott</hi> testifieth and saith, that I lived at  
Mr. George Carr, now deceased, at the time above mentioned,  
and was present with Mr. George Carr and Mr. Richard  
Carr. And I also saw a blue boar dart out of Mr. Bradbury gate to Mr. George Carr's horse's legs, which made  
him stumble after a strange manner. And I also saw the  
blue boar dart from Mr. Carr's horse's legs in at Mrs. Bradbury window. And Mr. Carr immediately said, `Boys,  
what did you see?' And we both said, `A blue boar.' Then  
said he, `From whence came it?' And we said, `Out of  
Mr. Bradbury's gate.' Then said he, `I am glad you see it  
as well as I.' <hi rend="italics">Jurat in Curia,</hi> Sept. 9, '92.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Stephen Sewall, the clerk of the courts, with his  
usual eagerness to make the most of the testimony  
against persons accused, adds to the deposition the  
following: &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="231" id="vII231"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2236">  
<figDesc>Page 231.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;And they both further say, on their oaths, that Mr.  
Carr discoursed with them, as they went home, about what  
had happened, and they all concluded that it was Mrs.  
Bradbury that so appeared as a blue boar.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>At the date of this occurrence, Richard Carr was  
twenty years of age, and Zerubabel Endicott a lad of  
of fifteen.</p>  
<p>It is not to be wondered at that there was &ldquo;some  
difference between&rdquo; George Carr and Mrs. Bradbury,  
if he was in the habit of indulging in such talk about  
her as he took the leading part in on this occasion.  
He evidently encouraged in his &ldquo;boys&rdquo; the absurd  
imaginations with which their credulity had been  
stimulated. They were prepared by preconceived notions to witness something preternatural about the  
premises of Mrs. Bradbury; and, in their jaundiced  
vision, any animal, moving in and out of the gate,  
might naturally assume the likeness of a &ldquo;blue boar.&rdquo;  
Such ideas circulating in the family, and among the  
apprentices of Carr, would soon be widely spread.  
No doubt, Zerubabel, on his visits to his home, told  
wondrous stories about Mrs. Bradbury. His brother  
Samuel, then a youth of eighteen, had his imagination  
filled with them; and some time after, on a voyage to  
&ldquo;Barbadoes and Saltitudos,&rdquo; in which severe storms  
and various disasters were experienced, attributed them  
all to Mrs. Bradbury; and, &ldquo;in a bright moonshining  
night, sitting upon the windlass, to which he had been  
 
sent forward to look out for land,&rdquo; the wild fancies of  
his excited imagination took effect. He heard &ldquo;a  
<pb n="232" id="vII232"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2237">  
<figDesc>Page 232.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
rumbling noise,&rdquo; and thought he saw the legs of some  
person. &ldquo;Presently he was shook, and looked over  
his shoulder, and saw the appearance of a woman,  
from her middle upwards, having a white cap and  
white neckcloth on her, which then affrighted him very  
much; and, as he was turning of the windlass, he saw  
the aforesaid two legs.&rdquo; Such superstitious phantasms  
seem to be natural to the experiences of sailor-life,  
and perhaps still linger in the forecastle and at the  
night-watch.</p>  
<p>The habit of maligning Mrs. Bradbury as a witch  
dated back in the Carr family more than thirteen years,  
as the following deposition proves. I give it precisely  
as it is in the original. As in a few other instances in  
this work, the spelling and punctuation are preserved  
as curiosities. Like all the papers in the case, with  
one exception, presented in court against Mrs. Bradbury, it is in the handwriting of Sergeant Thomas  
Putnam: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposistion of James Carr.</hi> who testifieth and

</p>  
<p>But the whole of George Carr's family did not sympathize in this morbid state of prejudice, or cherish  
such foolish and malignant fancies, against Mrs. Bradbury. One of the sons, William, had married, Aug.  
20, 1672, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Pike. It appears, by the following deposition, which is in the  
handwriting of Major Pike, that there had been another love affair between the families, leading to a  
melancholy result, inflaming still more the morbid and  
malign prejudice against Mrs. Bradbury; but William  
repudiated it utterly: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of William Carr,</hi> aged forty-one, or  
thereabouts, is that my brother John Carr, when he was  
young, was a man of as good capacity as most men of his  
age; but falling in love with Jane True (now wife of Captain

John March), and my father being persuaded by [] of  
the family (which I shall not name) not to let him marry  
so young, my father would not give him a portion, whereupon the match broke off, which my brother laid so much to  
heart that he grew melancholy, and by degrees much crazed,  
not being the man, that he was before, to his dying day.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;I do further testify that my said brother was sick about  
a fortnight or three weeks, and then died; and I was present  
with him when he died. And I do affirm that he died peaceably and quietly, never manifesting the least trouble in the  
world about anybody, nor did not say any thing of Mrs.  
Bradbury nor anybody else doing him hurt; and yet I was  
with him till the breath and life were out of his body.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The usual form, <hi rend="italics">jurat in curia,</hi> is written at the foot  
of this deposition, but evidently by a much later hand;  
and this leads me to mention the improbability that  
any testimony in favor of the accused ever reached  
the Court at the trials. They had no counsel: the  
attorney-general had prejudged all the cases; and his  
mind and those of the judges repudiated utterly any  
thing like an investigation. Every friendly voice was  
silenced. The doors were closed against the defence.  
Robert Pike, an assistant under the old and a councillor under the new government, endeavored in vain to  
enter them.</p>  
<p>William Carr was a person of great respectability,  
and bore the appointment, by the General Court, of  
land-surveyor for the towns in the northern part of  
the present county of Essex.</p>  
<p>The member of the family who &mdash; as stated in the  
<pb n="236" id="vII236"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2241">  
<figDesc>Page 236.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
foregoing deposition &mdash; prevented the match, all the circumstances seem to indicate, was Mrs. Ann Putnam.  
She perhaps had experienced the effects of a too early  
marriage, bringing the burden of life upon the constitution and the character before they are mature enough  
to bear it. She may have attributed to this cause  
the troubles and trials with which her cup had been so  
bitterly filled, and the blasting of the happiness of her  
youth. Half deranged, as perpetual excitement from  
the parish quarrels in reference to Mr. Bayley had made  
her, she may have become morbidly opposed to the  
equally early marriage of a brother. Added to this was  
the fact that Henry True had married one of Mrs. Bradbury daughters, and that Jane True was his sister.  
It cannot be doubted that she entertained the same  
ideas about Mrs. Bradbury as her father and brothers,  
James and Richard; and, for this reason, also opposed  
the match of her brother John. Wishing to be relieved  
from the self-reproach of having caused his derangement and death, when the witchcraft delusion broke  
out at Salem Village and she became wholly absorbed  
by it, as all other deaths and misfortunes were ascribed to it, she avowed and maintained the belief,  
as some had suspected at the time, that the happiness, health, reason, and life of her brother had been  
destroyed by diabolical agency, practised by Mrs. Bradbury.</p>  
<p>In the state of things long subsisting between the  
Bradbury and Carr families, we find an explanation of  
the movement made against Mrs. Bradbury. Young  
<pb n="237" id="vII237"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2242">  
<figDesc>Page 237.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Ann Putnam may have often heard her unpleasantly  
spoken of by her mother, and it was natural that she  
should have &ldquo;cried out against her.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The family of Mrs. Ann Putnam seem to have had  
constitutional traits that illustrate and explain her own  
character and conduct. They were excitable and sensitive to an extraordinary degree. Their judgment,  
reason, and physical systems, were subject to the power  
of their fancies and affections. One of her brothers,  
in consequence of being badly coquetted with and jilted  
by a young widow, was thrown into an awful condition  
of body and mind &ldquo;for about three-quarters of a  
year.&rdquo; The reason, health, and heart of another were  
broken; and he sunk into an early grave, in consequence of having been crossed in love. The death of  
her sister Bayley may have been caused by the unhappy  
controversies in the village parish. We have seen,  
and shall see, the all but maniac condition to which  
excitement brought her own mind. At last, the  
heaviest blow that can fall upon a fond wife suddenly  
snapped the brittle cord of her life. These considerations must be borne in mind, while we attempt to  
explain her conduct, and should throw the weight of  
pity and charity into the scales, if mortal judgment  
ventures to estimate her guilt. They are known to  
the Infinite Mind, and never overlooked by divine  
mercy.</p>  
<p>I have introduced these singular private details to  
illustrate what the documents all along show, &mdash; that  
the proceedings against persons charged with witchcraft,  
<pb n="238" id="vII238"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2243">  
<figDesc>Page 238.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in 1692, were instigated by all sorts of personal  
grudges and private piques, many of them of long  
standing, fomented and kept alive by an unhappy indulgence of unworthy feelings, always ready to mix  
themselves with popular excitements, and leading all  
concerned headlong to the utmost extent of mischief  
and wrong.</p>  
<p>The case of Mary Bradbury has been allowed to  
occupy so large a space, because I desire to disabuse  
the public mind of a great error on this subject. It  
has been too much supposed, that the sufferers in the  
witchcraft delusion were generally of the inferior  
classes of society, and particularly ignorant and benighted. They were the very reverse. They mostly  
belonged to families in the better conditions of life, and,  
many of them, to the highest social level. They were  
all persons of great moral firmness and rectitude, as  
was demonstrated by their bearing under persecutions  
and outrage, and when confronting the terrors of death.  
Their names do not deserve reproach, and their memories ought to be held in honor.</p>  
<p>The following account of the examination of Elizabeth Cary of Charlestown, given by her husband,  
Captain Cary, a shipmaster, has the highest interest,  
as written at the time by one who was an eye-witness,  
and participated in the sufferings of the occasion: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;May 24. &mdash; I having heard, some days, that my wife

advice went to Salem Village, to see if the afflicted knew  
her: we arrived there on the 24th of May. It happened

to be a day appointed for examination; accordingly, soon  
after our arrival, Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Corwin, &amp;c., went  
to the meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that  
work. The minister began with prayer; and, having taken  
care to get a convenient place, I observed that the afflicted  
were two girls of about ten years old, and about two or  
three others of about eighteen: one of the girls talked most,  
and could discern more than the rest.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;The prisoners were called in one by one, and, as they  
came in, were cried out at, &amp;c. The prisoners were placed  
about seven or eight feet from the justices, and the accusers  
between the justices and them. The prisoners were ordered  
to stand right before the justices, with an officer appointed to  
hold each hand, lest they should therewith afflict them: and  
the prisoners' eyes must be constantly on the justices; for,  
if they looked on the afflicted, they would either fall into  
fits, or cry out of being hurt by them. After an examination of the prisoners, who it was afflicted these girls, &amp;c.,  
they were put upon saying the Lord's Prayer, as a trial of  
their guilt. After the afflicted seemed to be out of their  
fits, they would look steadfastly on some one person, and  
frequently not speak; and then the justices said they were  
struck dumb, and after a little time would speak again: then  
the justices said to the accusers, `Which of you will go  
and touch the prisoner at the bar?' Then the most courageous would adventure, but, before they had made three  
steps, would ordinarily fall down as in a fit: the justices  
ordered that they should be taken up and carried to the  
prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon as they  
were touched by the accused, the justices would say, `They  
are well,' before I could discern any alteration, &mdash; by which  
I observed that the justices understood the manner of it.

Thus far I was only as a spectator: my wife also was there  
part of the time, but no notice was taken of her by the  
afflicted, except once or twice they came to her, and asked  
her name. But I, having an opportunity to discourse Mr.  
Hale (with whom I had formerly acquaintance), I took his  
advice what I had best do, and desired of him that I might  
have an opportunity to speak with her that accused my  
wife; which he promised should be, I acquainting him that  
I reposed my trust in him. Accordingly, he came to me  
after the examination was over, and told me I had now an  
opportunity to speak with the said accuser, Abigail Williams, a girl eleven or twelve years old; but that we could  
not be in private at Mr. Parris's house, as he had promised  
me: we went therefore into the alehouse, where an Indian  
man attended us, who, it seems, was one of the afflicted; to  
him we gave some cider: he showed several scars, that  
seemed as if they had been long there, and showed them  
as done by witchcraft, and acquainted us that his wife, who  
also was a slave, was imprisoned for witchcraft. And now,  
instead of one accuser, they all came in, and began to tumble  
down like swine; and then three women were called in to  
attend them. We in the room were all at a stand to see  
who they would cry out of; but in a short time they cried out  
`Cary;' and, immediately after, a warrant was sent from  
the justices to bring my wife before them, who were sitting  
in a chamber near by, waiting for this. Being brought  
before the justices, her chief accusers were two girls. My  
wife declared to the justices, that she never had any knowledge of them before that day. She was forced to stand  
with her arms stretched out. I requested that I might hold  
one of her hands, but it was denied me: then she desired  
me to wipe the tears from her eyes, and the sweat from her  
<pb n="241" id="vII241"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2246">  
<figDesc>Page 241.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
face, which I did; then she desired she might lean herself  
on me, saying she should faint. Justice Hathorne replied  
she had strength enough to torment these persons, and she  
should have strength enough to stand. I speaking something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded me  
to be silent, or else I should be turned out of the room.  
The Indian before mentioned was also brought in, to be  
one of her accusers; being come in, he now (when before  
the justices) fell down, and tumbled about like a hog, but  
said nothing. The justices asked the girls who afflicted the  
Indian: they answered she (meaning my wife), and that  
she now lay upon him. The justices ordered her to touch  
him, in order to his cure, but her head must be turned  
another way, lest, instead of curing, she should make him  
worse by her looking on him, her hand being guided to  
take hold of his; but the Indian took hold of her hand, and  
pulled her down on the floor in a barbarous manner: then  
his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and the  
cure was quickly wrought. I being extremely troubled at  
their inhuman dealings, uttered a hasty speech, `That God  
would take vengeance on them, and desired that God would  
deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.' Then her  
<hi rend="italics">mittimus</hi> was writ. I did with difficulty and charge obtain  
the liberty of a room, but no beds in it; if there had been,  
could have taken but little rest that night. She was committed to Boston prison; but I obtained a <foreign lang="unknown" rend="italics">habeas corpus</foreign> to  
remove her to Cambridge prison, which is in our county of  
Middlesex. Having been there one night, next morning the  
jailer put irons on her legs (having received such a command); the weight of them was about eight pounds: these  
irons and her other afflictions soon brought her into convulsion  
<pb n="242" id="vII242"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2247">  
<figDesc>Page 242.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fits, so that I thought she would have died that  
night. I sent to entreat that the irons might be taken off;  
but all entreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her  
life, so that in this condition she must continue. The trials  
at Salem coming on, I went thither to see how things were  
managed: and finding that the spectre evidence was there  
received, together with idle, if not malicious stories, against  
people's lives, I did easily perceive which way the rest would  
go; for the same evidence that served for one would serve  
for all the rest. I acquainted her with her danger; and that,  
if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she would  
never return. I did my utmost that she might have her  
trial in our own county; I with several others petitioning  
the judge for it, and were put in hopes of it: but I soon  
saw so much, that I understood thereby it was not intended; which put me upon consulting the means of her  
escape, which, through the goodness of God, was effected,  
and she got to Rhode Island, but soon found herself not  
safe when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from  
thence she went to New York, along with some others that  
had escaped their cruel hands, where we found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Esq., Governor, who was very  
courteous to us. After this, some of my goods were seized  
in a friend's hands, with whom I had left them, and myself  
imprisoned by the sheriff, and kept in custody half a day,  
and then dismissed; but to speak of their usage of the  
prisoners, and the inhumanity shown to them at the time  
of their execution, no sober Christian could bear. They  
had also trials of cruel mockings, which is the more, considering what a people for religion, I mean the profession  
of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of

them church members, and most of them unspotted in their  
conversation, till their adversary the Devil took up this  
method for accusing them. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jonathan Cary.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The only account we have, written by one who had  
actually experienced, in his own person, what it was  
to fall into the hands of those who got up and carried  
on the prosecutions, is the following. Captain Alden  
had probably been from an early stage in their operations in the eye of the accusing girls. He was meant,  
perhaps, by what often fell from them about &ldquo;the tall  
man in Boston.&rdquo; We are left entirely to conjecture  
as to the reason why they singled him out, as not one  
of them, we may be quite sure, had ever seen him.  
It may be that some person who had experienced  
discipline under his orders as a naval commander  
bore him a grudge, and took pains to suggest his  
name to the girls, and provided them with the coarse,  
vulgar, and ridiculous scandal they so recklessly  
poured out upon him: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">An Account how John Alden, Sr., was dealt with at Salem  
Village.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;John Alden, Sr., of Boston, in the county of Suffolk,  
mariner, on the twenty-eighth day of May, 1692, was  
sent for by the magistrates of Salem, in the county of  
Essex, upon the accusation of a company of poor distracted  
or possessed creatures or witches; and, being sent by Mr.  
Stoughton, arrived there on the 31st of May, and appeared  
at Salem Village before Mr. Gedney, Mr. Hathorne, and  
Mr. Corwin.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Those wenches being present who played their juggling  
<pb n="244" id="vII244"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2249">  
<figDesc>Page 244.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
tricks, falling down, crying out, and staring in people's  
faces, the magistrates demanded of them several times,  
who it was, of all the people in the room, that hurt them.  
One of these accusers pointed several times at one Captain  
Hill, there present, but spake nothing. The same accuser  
had a man standing at her back to hold her up. He stooped  
down to her ear: then she cried out, `Alden, Alden afflicted  
her.' One of the magistrates asked her if she had ever  
seen Alden. She answered, `No.' He asked her how she  
knew it was Alden. She said the man told her so.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Then all were ordered to go down into the street,  
where a ring was made; and the same accuser cried out,  
`There stands Alden, a bold fellow, with his hat on before  
the judges: he sells powder and shot to the Indians and  
French, and lies with the Indian squaws, and has Indian  
papooses.' Then was Alden committed to the marshal's  
custody, and his sword taken from him; for they said he  
afflicted them with his sword. After some hours, Alden  
was sent for to the meeting-house in the Village, before  
the magistrates, who required Alden to stand upon a chair,  
to the open view of all the people.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;The accusers cried out that Alden pinched them then,  
when he stood upon the chair, in the sight of all the people,  
a good way distant from them. One of the magistrates  
bid the marshal to hold open Alden's hands, that he might  
not pinch those creatures. Alden asked them why they  
should think that he should come to that village to afflict  
those persons that he never knew or saw before. Mr.  
Gedney bid Alden to confess, and give glory to God. Alden  
said he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped he  
should never gratify the Devil: but appealed to all that ever  
knew him, if they ever suspected him to be such a person;  
<pb n="245" id="vII245"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2250">  
<figDesc>Page 245.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and challenged any one that could bring in any thing on  
their own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being  
such an one. Mr. Gedney said he had known Alden many  
years, and had been at sea with him, and always looked  
upon him to be an honest man; but now he saw cause to  
alter his judgment. Alden answered, he was sorry for that,  
but he hoped God would clear up his innocency, that he  
would recall that judgment again; and added, that he hoped  
that he should, with Job, maintain his integrity till he died.  
They bid Alden look upon the accusers, which he did, and  
then they fell down. Alden asked Mr. Gedney what reason  
there could be given why Alden's looking upon <hi rend="italics">him</hi> did  
not strike <hi rend="italics">him</hi> down as well; but no reason was given that  
I heard. But the accusers were brought to Alden to touch  
them; and this touch, they said, made them well. Alden  
began to speak of the providence of God in suffering these  
creatures to accuse innocent persons. Mr. Noyes asked  
Alden why he should offer to speak of the providence of  
God: God, by his providence (said Mr. Noyes), governs  
the world, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with  
discourse, and stopped Alden's mouth as to that. Alden  
told Mr. Gedney that he could assure him that there was a  
lying spirit in them; for I can assure you that there is not  
a word of truth in all these say of me. But Alden was  
again committed to the marshal, and his <hi rend="italics">mittimus</hi> written.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;To Boston Alden was carried by a constable: no bail  
would be taken for him, but was delivered to the prisonkeeper, where he remained fifteen weeks; and then, observing the manner of trials, and evidence then taken, was at  
length prevailed with to make his escape.</p>

</p>  
<p>Alden made his escape about the middle of September, at the bloodiest crisis of the tragedy, and just  
before the execution of nine of the victims, including  
that of Giles Corey. He is understood to have fled  
to Duxbury, where his relatives secreted him. He  
made his appearance among them late at night; and,  
on their asking an explanation of his unexpected visit  
at that hour, replied that he was flying from the  
Devil, and the Devil was after him. After a while,  
when the delusion had abated, and people were coming to their senses, he delivered himself up, and was  
bound over to the Superior Court at Boston, the last  
Tuesday in April, 1693, when, no one appearing to  
prosecute, he, with some hundred and fifty others, was  
discharged by proclamation, and all judicial proceedings brought to a close. It is to be feared, that ever  
after, to his dying day, when the subject of his experience on the 31st of May, 1692, was referred to,  
the old sailor indulged in rather strong expressions  
in relating his reminiscences of Rev. &ldquo;Mr. Nicholas Noyes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Bartholomew Gedney,&rdquo; and the  
&ldquo;wenches&rdquo; of Salem Village.</p>  
<p>Captain John Alden was a son of John Alden,  
ever memorable as one of the first founders of Plymouth Colony. He had been for more than thirty  
years a resident of Boston, a member of the church,  
and in all respects a leading and distinguished man.  
For some time, he had been commander of the armed  
vessel belonging to the colony, and was a brave and  
efficient officer and an able and experienced mariner.  
<pb n="247" id="vII247"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2252">  
<figDesc>Page 247.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
He had seen service in French and Indian wars,  
had acted two years before, that is in 1690, as commissioner in conducting negotiations with the native  
tribes, and, at a later period, was charged with important trusts as a naval commander. He was a man  
of large property, and seventy years of age. He was,  
as well he might be, utterly confounded and amazed  
in finding himself charged as a principal culprit in  
the Salem witchcraft. The accusing girls were evidently delighted to get hold of such a notable and  
doughty character; and their tongues were released,  
on the occasion, from all restraints of decorum and  
decency. When the ring was formed around him  
&ldquo;in the street,&rdquo; in front of Deacon Ingersoll's door,  
his sword unbuckled from his side, and such foul  
and vulgar aspersions cast upon his good name, he  
felt, no doubt, that it would have been better to have  
fallen into the hands of savages of the wilderness or  
pirates on the sea, than of the crowd of audacious  
girls that hustled him about in Salem Village. It  
was a relief to his wounded honor, and gave leisure  
for the workings of his indignant resentment, to escape  
from them into Boston jail. Not only his old shipmate, Bartholomew Gedney, but, as will be seen, the  
learned attorney-general, who was present, and witnessed the whole affair, was fully convinced of his  
guilt.</p>  
<p>The wife of an honest and worthy man in Andover  
was sick of a fever. After all the usual means had  
failed to check the symptoms of her disease, the idea  
<pb n="248" id="vII248"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2253">  
<figDesc>Page 248.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
became prevalent that she was suffering under an  
&ldquo;evil hand.&rdquo; The husband, pursuant of the advice  
of friends, posted down to Salem Village to ascertain  
from the afflicted girls who was bewitching his wife.  
Two of them returned with him to Andover. Never  
did a place receive such fatal visitors. The Grecian  
horse did not bring greater consternation to ancient  
Ilium. Immediately after their arrival, they succeeded  
in getting more than fifty of the inhabitants into  
prison, several of whom were hanged. A perfect panic  
swept like a hurricane over the place. The idea seized  
all minds, as Hutchinson expresses it, that the only  
&ldquo;way to prevent an accusation was to become an  
accuser.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;The number of the afflicted increased  
every day, and the number of the accused in proportion.&rdquo; In this state of things, such a great accession being made to the ranks of the confessing  
witches, the power of the delusion became irresistibly  
strengthened. Mr. Dudley Bradstreet, the magistrate  
of the place, after having committed about forty persons to jail, concluded he had done enough, and declined to arrest any more. The consequence was  
that he and his wife were cried out upon, and they  
had to fly for their lives. They accused his brother,  
John Bradstreet, with having &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; a dog. Bradstreet escaped by flight. The dog was executed. The  
number of persons who had publicly confessed that  
they had entered into a league with Satan, and exercised the diabolical power thus acquired, to the  
injury, torment, and death of innocent parties, produced  
<pb n="249" id="vII249"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2254">  
<figDesc>Page 249.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
a profound effect upon the public mind. At  
the same time, the accusers had everywhere increased  
in number, owing to the inflamed state of imagination universally prevalent which ascribed all ailments  
or diseases to the agency of witches, to a mere love  
of notoriety and a passion for general sympathy, to  
a desire to be secure against the charge of bewitching  
others, or to a malicious disposition to wreak vengeance upon enemies. The prisons in Salem, Ipswich,  
Boston, and Cambridge, were crowded. All the securities of society were dissolved. Every man's life was  
at the mercy of every other man. Fear sat on every  
countenance, terror and distress were in all hearts,  
silence pervaded the streets: all who could, quit the  
country; business was at a stand; a conviction sunk  
into the minds of men, that a dark and infernal confederacy had got foot-hold in the land, threatening to  
overthrow and extirpate religion and morality, and  
establish the kingdom of the Prince of darkness in  
a country which had been dedicated, by the prayers  
and tears and sufferings of its pious fathers, to the  
Church of Christ and the service and worship of  
the true God. The feeling, dismal and horrible indeed, became general, that the providence of God  
was removed from them; that Satan was let loose,  
and he and his confederates had free and unrestrained power to go to and fro, torturing and destroying whomever he willed. We cannot, by any extent  
of research or power of imagination, enter fully into  
the ideas of the people of that day; and it is therefore  
<pb n="250" id="vII250"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2255">  
<figDesc>Page 250.</figDesc>

absolutely impossible to appreciate the awful condition of the community at the point of time to which  
our narrative has led us.</p>

<note id="v2n2"><p>* In the innumerable depositions written by Thomas Putnam, he is  
not so careful to be correct, in his chirography and construction, as in  
his parish-records. But, if the reader is inclined to make the experiment, he will find, that, if the above document should be properly  
pointed and spelled, according to our fashion at the present day, it  
would read well, and is clearly and forcibly put together. Spelling, at  
that time, was phonetic, and it enables us to ascertain the then prevalent pronunciation of words. &ldquo;Corsely,&rdquo; no doubt, shows how the  
word was then spoken. &ldquo;Angury&rdquo; was, with a large class of words  
now dissyllables, then a trisyllable. &ldquo;Tould,&rdquo; &ldquo;spaking,&rdquo; and many  
other words above, are spelled just as they were then pronounced.  
&ldquo;Wicthcraft&rdquo; is always, I believe, spelled this way by Thomas Putnam. He had not got rid of the old Anglo-Saxon sound of the word  
&ldquo;witch,&rdquo; brought by his father from Buckinghamshire, sixty years  
before, &mdash; &ldquo;wicca.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The condition of medical science and practice, at that period, is curiously illustrated in this paper. It is plain that the distemper of James  
Carr was purely in the realm of the sensibilities and fancy; and &ldquo;doctor  
Crosbe&rdquo; is not wholly to blame because his &ldquo;visek&rdquo; did not &ldquo;work.&rdquo;  
A good smart nightmare, with a feeling that he had given a thorough  
basting to the spectre, in the form of a cat, of the supposed author of  
his woful and aggravated disappointment in love, was what he needed;  
and it cured him. &ldquo;A posset of sack&rdquo; was Falstaff's refuge, from the  
plight into which he had been led by &ldquo;building upon a foolish woman's  
promise,&rdquo; when he emerged from the Thames and the &ldquo;buck-basket.&rdquo;  
Many others, no doubt, in drowning sorrow and mortification, have  
found it &ldquo;the sovereignest thing on earth.&rdquo; But, as administered by  
physicians of the Dr. Crosby school, with tobacco steeped in it, it must  
have been a &ldquo;villanous compound.&rdquo;</p></note>

<div3 type="segment"><head></head>  
<p>In the midst of this state of things, the old colony  
of Massachusetts was transformed into a royal province, and a new government organized. Sir William  
Phips, the governor, arrived at Boston, with the  
new charter, on the evening of the 14th of May.  
William Stoughton, of Dorchester, superseded Thomas  
Danforth as deputy-governor. In the Council, which  
took the place of the Assistants, most of the former  
body were retained. Bartholomew Gedney had a few  
years before been dropped from the board of Assistants.  
He was now placed in the Council with John Hathorne,  
Jonathan Corwin, Samuel Appleton, and Robert Pike,  
of this county. The new government did not interfere  
with the proceedings in progress relating to the  
witchcraft prosecutions, at the moment. Examinations and commitments went on as before; only the  
magistrates, acting on those occasions, were re-enforced  
by Mr. Gedney, who presided at their sessions. The  
affair had become so formidable, and the public infatuation had reached such a point, that it was difficult  
to determine what ought to be done. Sir William  
Phips, no doubt, felt that it was beyond his depth,  
and yielded himself to the views of the leading men  
of his council. Stoughton was in full sympathy with  
Cotton Mather, whose interest had been used in procuring his appointment over Danforth. Through him,  
Mather acquired, and held for some time, great ascendency  
<pb n="251" id="vII251"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2256">  
<figDesc>Page 251.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
with the governor. It was concluded best  
to appoint a special court of Oyer and Terminer for  
the witchcraft trials. Stoughton, the deputy-governor,  
was commissioned as chief-justice. Nathaniel Saltonstall` of Haverhill; Major John Richards of Boston;  
Major Bartholomew Gedney of Salem; Mr. Wait Winthrop, Captain Samuel Sewall, and Mr. Peter Sargent,  
all three of Boston, &mdash; were made associate judges.  
Saltonstall early withdrew from the service; and Jonathan Corwin, of Salem, succeeded to his place on the  
bench of the special court. A majority of the judges  
were citizens of Boston.</p>  
<p>Jonathan Corwin had been associated with Hathorne in conducting the examinations that have been  
described. He was a son of George Corwin, who has  
been noticed in the account of Salem Village.</p>  
<p>A shade of illegality rests upon the very existence  
of this special court. There has always been a question whether the new charter gave to the governor  
and council power to create it without the concurrence of the House of Representatives. It has been  
held that such a court could have no other lawful  
foundation than an act of the General Court. Hutchinson was evidently of this opinion. This question  
was a very serious one; for, as that considerate and  
able historian and eminent judicial officer says, the  
tribunal that passed sentence in the witchcraft prosecutions was &ldquo;the most important court to the life  
of the subject which was ever held in the province.&rdquo;  
The time required to convene the popular branch of the  
<pb n="252" id="vII252"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2257">  
<figDesc>Page 252.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
government is itself, in all cases, an element of safety.  
In this case, it would have carried the country beyond  
the period of the delusion, and saved its annals from  
their darkest and bloodiest page. The condition of  
things when he arrived, had his counsellors been wise,  
would have led Sir William Phips forthwith to issue  
writs of election of deputies, before taking any action  
whatever. In a free republican government, the executive department ought never to attempt to dispose  
of difficult matters of vital importance without the  
joint deliberations and responsibility of the representatives of the people.</p>  
<p>So far as the composition of the court is considered, no objection can be made. The justices were  
all members of the council, and belonged to the highest order, not only of the magistracy, but of society  
generally. They constituted as respectable a body of  
gentlemen as could have been collected. Thomas  
Newton, of Boston, was commissioned to act as attorney. The official title of marshal ceasing with  
the new government, George Corwin was appointed  
sheriff of the county of Essex. Herrick appears to  
have continued in the service as deputy. Sheriff  
Corwin was twenty-six years of age. He was the  
grandson of the original George Corwin, and the son  
of John. His mother was grand-daughter of Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts, and daughter of  
Governor Winthrop of Connecticut. His wife was a  
daughter of Bartholomew Gedney; so that it appears  
that two of the judges were his uncles, and one his

father-in-law. These personal connections may be  
borne in mind, as affording ground to believe, that, in  
the discharge of his painful duties, he did not act without advice and suggestions from the highest quarter.</p>  
<p>The court-house in which the trials were held stood  
in the middle of what is now Washington Street, near  
where Lynde and Church Streets, which did not then  
exist, now enter it, fronting towards Essex Street.  
The building was also used as a town-house; Washington Street being, for this reason, then called &ldquo;Town Lane.&rdquo; Off against the court-house, on the  
west side of the lane, was the house of the Rev. Nicholas Noyes, on the site of the residence of the late  
Robert Brookhouse. Opposite to it was the estate  
of Edward Bishop, which fronted westerly on &ldquo;Town Lane&rdquo; a little over a hundred feet, including  
the present Jeffrey Court, and extending a few feet  
beyond the corner of the house of Dr. S. M. Cate,  
over a portion of Church Street. Its depth, towards  
St. Peter Street, was about three hundred and forty feet. Edward Bishop held this estate in the right  
of his wife Bridget, the widow of Thomas Oliver  
who had died about 1679. Not long after this marriage, Bishop removed to his farm at Royal Side. In  
1685, the &ldquo;old Oliver house&rdquo; was either removed or  
rebuilt, and a new one erected on the same premises,  
which was occupied by tenants in 1692. These items  
are given because they will help to illustrate the  
narrative, and enable us to understand points of  
evidence in the approaching trial. It is a curious

circumstance, that the first public victim of the prosecutions, Bridget Bishop, had been the nearest neighbor  
and lived directly opposite, to the person who, more  
than any other inhabitant of the town, was responsible  
for the blood that was shed, &mdash; Nicholas Noyes. The  
jail, at that time, was on the western side of Prison  
Lane, now St. Peter Street, north of the point where  
Federal Street now enters it. The meeting-house  
stood on what has always been the site of the First  
Church. The &ldquo;Ship Tavern&rdquo; was on ground the  
front of which is occupied, at present, by &ldquo;West's  
Block,&rdquo; nearly opposite the head of Central Street.  
It had long been owned and kept by John Gedney,  
Sr. Two of his sons, John and Bartholomew, had  
married Susanna and Hannah Clarke. John died in  
1685. His widow moved into the family of her father; and, after his death in 1688, continued to keep  
the house. In 1698 she was married to Deliverance  
Parkman, and died in 1728. The tavern, in 1692, was  
known as the &ldquo;Widow Gedney's.&rdquo; The estate had an  
extensive orchard in the rear, contiguous, along its  
northern boundary, to the orchard of Bridget Bishop,  
which occupied ground now covered by the Lyceum  
building, and one or two others to the east of it.</p>  
<p>The Court was opened at Salem in the first week  
of June, 1692. In the mean time, the attorney-general,  
to prepare for the management of the cases, came to  
Salem. He addressed the following letter to Isaac  
Addington, Secretary of the province: &mdash;</p>

<p>Hutchinson says that there was no colony or province law against witchcraft in force when the trials  
began; and that the proceedings were under an act of  
James the First, passed in 1603. By that act, persons  
convicted were to be sentenced to &ldquo;the pains and  
penalties of death as felons.&rdquo; By the colonial law, conviction of capital crimes did not incapacitate the party  
affected from disposing of property. In this and other  
respects, there were points of difference, which caused  
some inconvenience in carrying out the practice of  
the mother-country; and the attorney-general had to  
supply the want of experience in the local officers.</p>  
<p>It may here be mentioned, that no record of the  
doings of this special court are now to be found, and  
our only information respecting them is obtained in  
brief and imperfect statements of writers of the time.  
Perhaps Hutchinson had the use of the records. He  
gives the dates of the several sessions of the courts,  
and of the conviction and execution of the prisoners.  
Some of the depositions sworn to in court are on file,  
but without giving in many instances the date when  
thus offered in the trials. In some cases, they state  
when they were laid before the grand jury. Only a  
small part of them are preserved. The matter they  
contain was, to a considerable extent, brought forward  
at the preliminary examinations, and has been already  
adduced. In the following account of the trials, some  
further use will be made of these depositions.</p>  
<p>Bridget Bishop was the only person tried at the  
first session of the Court. She was brought through

Prison Lane, up Essex Street, by the First Church,  
into Town-house Lane, to the Court-house. Cotton  
Mather says, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;There was one strange thing with which the court was  
newly entertained. As this woman was under a guard,  
passing by the great and spacious meeting-house, she gave  
a look towards the house; and immediately a demon, invisibly entering the meeting-house, tore down a part of it:  
so that, though there was no person to be seen there, yet  
the people, at the noise, running in, found a board, which  
was strongly fastened with several nails, transported into  
another quarter of the house.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It is probable that the streets were thronged by  
crowds eager to get a sight of the prisoner; and that  
the doors, fences, and house-tops were occupied. Some,  
perhaps, got into the meeting-house; and, in clambering up to the windows, a board may have been put in  
requisition, and left misplaced. Incredible almost as  
it is, this circumstance seems, from Mather's language, &mdash; &ldquo;the court was entertained,&rdquo; &mdash; to have been  
brought in evidence at the trial, and regarded as  
weighty and conclusive proof of Bridget's guilt.</p>  
<p>One or two points in the evidence adduced against  
her, in addition to those mentioned heretofore, deserve  
consideration. The position taken, at her trial, by  
the Rev. John Hale of Beverly demands criticism.  
The charge of witchcraft had been made against her  
on more than one occasion before; particularly about  
the year 1687, when she resided near the bounds of  
Beverly, at Royal Side. A woman in the neighborhood,  
<pb n="258" id="vII258"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2263">  
<figDesc>Page 258.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
subject to fits of insanity, had, while passing into  
one of them, brought the accusation against her; but,  
on the return of her reason, solemnly recanted, and  
deeply lamented the aspersion. In a violent recurrence of her malady, this woman committed suicide.  
Mr. Hale had examined the case at the time, and  
exonerated Bridget Bishop, who was a communicant in  
his church, from the charge made against her by the  
unhappy lunatic. He was satisfied, as he states, that  
&ldquo;Sister Bishop&rdquo; was innocent, and in no way deserved  
to be ill thought of. He hoped &ldquo;better of said Goody  
Bishop at that time.&rdquo; Without any pretence of new  
evidence touching the facts of the case, he came into  
court in 1692, and related them, to the effect and  
with the intent to make them bear against her. He  
described the appearance of the throat of the woman,  
after death, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;As to the wounds she died of, I observed three deadly  
ones; a piece of her windpipe cut out, and another wound  
above that through the windpipe and gullet, and the vein  
they call jugular. So that I then judged and still do apprehend it impossible for her, with so short a pair of scissors, to  
mangle herself so without some extraordinary work of the  
Devil or witchcraft.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>If this was his impression at the time, it is strange  
that he did not then say so. But there is no appearance of any criminal proceedings having been had, by  
the grand jury or otherwise, against &ldquo;Sister Bishop&rdquo;  
on the occasion. On the contrary, Mr. Hale seems to  
have acquiesced in the opinion, that the derangement of  
<pb n="259" id="vII259"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2264">  
<figDesc>Page 259.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the woman was aggravated, if not caused, by her being  
overmuch given to searching and pondering upon the  
dark passages and mysterious imagery of prophecy.  
The truth, in all probability, is, that Mr. Hale's suspicion was an after-thought. The effect produced upon  
his mental condition by the statements and actings of  
the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; in 1692 was unconsciously  
transferred to 1687. The delusion, in which he was  
then fully participating, led him to put a different  
interpretation upon the suicidal wounds and horrible  
end of the wretched maniac, five or six years before.</p>  
<p>A piece of evidence, which illustrates the state of  
opinion at that time, relating to our subject, given in  
this case, is worthy of notice. Samuel Shattuck was  
a hatter and dyer. His house was on the south side  
of Essex Street, opposite the western entrance to the  
grounds of the North Church. Before her removal to  
the village, Bridget Bishop was in the habit of calling  
at Shattuck's to have articles of dress dyed. He states  
that she treated him and his family politely and kindly;  
or, as he characterized her deportment after his mind  
had become jaundiced against her, &ldquo;in a smooth and  
flattering manner.&rdquo; He tells his story in a deposition  
written by him, and signed and sworn to in Court  
by himself and wife, June 2, 1692. It is as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Our eldest child, who promised as much health and  
understanding, both by countenance and actions, as any  
other children of his years, was taken in a very drooping  
<pb n="260" id="vII260"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2265">  
<figDesc>Page 260.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
condition; and, as she came oftener to the house, he grew  
worse and worse. As he would be standing at the door,  
would fall out, and bruise his face upon a great step-stone,  
as if he had been thrust out by an invisible hand; oftentimes falling, and hitting his face against the sides of the  
house, bruising his face in a very miserable manner....  
This child taken in a terrible fit, his mouth and eyes  
drawn aside, and gasped in such a manner as if he was upon  
the point of death. After this, he grew worse in his fits,  
and, out of them, would be almost always crying. That,  
for many months, he would be crying till nature's strength  
was spent, and then would fall asleep, and then awake, and  
fall to crying and moaning; and that his very countenance  
did bespeak compassion. And at length, we perceived his  
understanding decayed: so that we feared (as it has since  
proved) that he would be quite bereft of his wits; for, ever  
since, he has been stupefied and void of reason, his fits still  
following of him. After he had been in this kind of sickness  
some time, he has gone into the garden, and has got upon a  
board of an inch thick, which lay flat upon the ground, and we  
have called him; he would come to the edge of the board, and  
hold out his hand, and make as if he would come, but could  
not till he was helped off the board.... My wife has offered  
him a cake and money to come to her; and he has held out  
his hand, and reached after it, but could not come till he had  
been helped off the board, by which I judge some enchantment kept him on.... Ever since, this child hath been followed with grievous fits, as if he would never recover more;  
his head and eyes drawn aside so as if they would never  
come to rights more; lying as if he were, in a manner,  
dead; falling anywhere, either into fire or water, if he be  
not constantly looked to; and, generally, in such an uneasy,  
<pb n="261" id="vII261"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2266">  
<figDesc>Page 261.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
restless frame, almost always running to and fro, acting so  
strange that I cannot judge otherwise but that he is bewitched: and, by these circumstances, do believe that the  
aforesaid Bridget Oliver &mdash; now called Bishop &mdash; is the cause  
of it: and it has been the judgment of doctors, such as lived  
here and foreigners, that he is under an evil hand of witchcraft.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The means used to give this direction to the suspicions of Shattuck and his wife are described in the  
notice of Bridget Bishop, in the First Part of this work.</p>  
<p>Shattuck was a son of the sturdy Quaker of that  
name who, thirty years before, had given the government of the colony so much trouble, and seems to  
have inherited some of his notions. In his deposition,  
he mentions, as corroborative proof of Bridget Bishop's  
being a witch, that she used to bring to his dye-house  
&ldquo;sundry pieces of lace,&rdquo; of shapes and dimensions  
entirely outside of his conceptions of what could be  
needed in the wardrobe, or for the toilet, of a plain and  
honest woman. He evidently regarded fashionable  
and vain apparel as a snare and sign of the Devil.</p>  
<p>The imaginations of several persons in Shattuck's  
immediate neighborhood seem to have been wrought  
up to a high point against Bridget Bishop. John  
Cook lived on the south side of the street, directly  
opposite the eastern entrance to the grounds of the  
North Church, on its present site. John Bly's house  
was on a lot contiguous to the rear of Cook's, fronting  
on Summer Street. One of Cook's sons (John), aged  
eighteen, testified, that, &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="262" id="vII262"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2267">  
<figDesc>Page 262.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;About five or six years ago, one morning about sun, as I was in bed, before I rose, I saw Goodwife Bishop,  
<hi rend="italics">alias</hi> Oliver, stand in the chamber by the window: and she  
looked on me and grinned on me, and presently struck me on  
the side of the head, which did very much hurt me; and then  
I saw her go out under the end window at a little crevice,  
about so big as I could thrust my hand into. I saw her  
again the same day, &mdash; which was the sabbath-day, &mdash; about  
noon, walk across the room; and having, at the time, an  
apple in my hand, it flew out of my hand into my mother's  
lap, who sat six or eight foot distance from me, and then she  
disappeared: and, though my mother and several others  
were in the same room, yet they affirmed they saw her  
not.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Bly and his wife Rebecca had a difficulty with Bishop  
in reference to payment for a hog they had bought of  
her. The following is from their testimony at her trial.  
After stating that she came to their house and quarrelled with them about it, they go on to say that the  
animal &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;was taken with strange fits, jumping up, and knocking her  
head against the fence, and seemed blind and deaf, and would  
not eat, neither let her pigs suck, but foamed at the mouth;  
which Goody Henderson, hearing of, said she believed she  
was overlooked, and that they had their cattle ill in such a  
manner at the Eastward, when they lived there, and used to  
cure them by giving of them red ochre and milk, which we  
also gave the sow. Quickly after eating of which, she grew  
better; and then, for the space of near two hours together,  
she, getting into the street, did set off, jumping and running  
between the house of said deponents and said Bishop's, as if  
<pb n="263" id="vII263"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2268">  
<figDesc>Page 263.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
she were stark mad, and, after that, was well again: and  
we did then apprehend or judge, and do still, that said  
Bishop had bewitched said sow.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>William Stacey testified, that, as he was &ldquo;agoing to  
mill,&rdquo; meeting Bishop in the street, some conversation  
passed between them, and that, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;being gone about six rods from her, the said Bishop, with  
a small load in his cart, suddenly the off-wheel slumped or  
sunk down into a hole upon plain ground; that this deponent  
was forced to get one to help him get the wheel out. Afterwards, this deponent went back to look for said hole where  
his wheel sunk in, but could not find any hole.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Stacey further deposed, that, on another occasion,  
he &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;met the said Bishop by Isaac Stearns's brick-kiln. After  
he had passed by her, this deponent's horse stood still with  
a small load going up the hill; so that, the horse striving to  
draw, all his gears and tackling flew in pieces, and the cart  
fell down.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>These mishaps and marvels occurred in Summer  
Street, near the foot of Chestnut Street, where the  
ground was then much lower than it is now. Stacey  
was ascending the street, on his way through High  
Street to his father's mill, at the South River.</p>  
<p>Stacey concluded his testimony as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;This deponent hath met with several other of her  
pranks at several times, which would take up a great time to  
tell of.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;This deponent doth verily believe that the said Bridget  
Bishop was instrumental to his daughter Priscilla's death.  
<pb n="264" id="vII264"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2269">  
<figDesc>Page 264.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
About two years ago, the child was a likely, thriving child;  
and suddenly screeched out, and so continued, in an unusual  
manner, for about a fortnight, and so died in that lamentable  
manner.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Many of the extraordinary &ldquo;pranks,&rdquo; charged upon  
Bridget Bishop, had their scene near to her dwellinghouse. John Louder, a servant of John Gedney, Sr.,  
some years before, had a controversy with her about  
her fowls, &ldquo;that used to come into our orchard or garden.&rdquo; He swore as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Some little time after which, I, going well to bed, about  
the dead of the night, felt a great weight upon my breast,  
and, awakening, looked; and, it being bright moonlight, did  
clearly see said Bridget Bishop, or her likeness, sitting upon  
my stomach; and, putting my arms off of the bed to free myself from the great oppression, she presently laid hold of my  
throat, and almost choked me, and I had no strength or  
power in my hands to resist, or help myself; and, in this condition, she held me to almost day. Some time after this, my  
mistress (Susannah Gedney) was in our orchard, and I was  
then with her; and said Bridget Bishop, being then in her  
orchard, &mdash; which was next adjoining to ours, &mdash; my mistress  
told said Bridget that I said or affirmed that she came, one  
night, and sat upon my breast, as aforesaid, which she denied, and I affirmed to her face to be true, and that I did  
plainly see her; upon which discourse with her, she threatened me. And, some time after that, I, being not very well,  
stayed at home on a Lord's Day; and, on the afternoon of said  
day, the doors being shut, I did see a black pig in the room  
coming towards me; so I went towards it to kick it, and it  
vanished away.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<pb n="265" id="vII265"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2270">  
<figDesc>Page 265.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>Louder goes on to say, that, immediately after this,  
on the same occasion while he was staying at home  
from meeting, he saw a black thing jump into the window, and it came and stood just before his face &ldquo;upon  
the bar.&rdquo; The body of it looked like a monkey, only  
the feet were like a cock's feet with claws, and the  
face somewhat more like a man's than a monkey's.  
He says that he was greatly affrighted, &ldquo;not being  
able to speak or help myself by reason of fear, I suppose;&rdquo; and that his mysterious visitor made quite a  
speech to him, representing that it was a messenger  
sent to say, that, if he would &ldquo;be ruled by him, he  
should want for nothing in this world.&rdquo; The virtuous  
and indignant Louder says that he answered, &ldquo;You  
devil, I will kill you!&rdquo; and gave it a blow with his  
fist, but &ldquo;could feel no substance; and it jumped out  
of the window again.&rdquo; It immediately came in by the  
porch, although the doors were shut, and said, &ldquo;You  
had better take my counsel.&rdquo; Hereupon Louder  
struck at it with a stick, hitting the ground-sill and  
breaking the stick, but felt no substance. Louder  
concludes his testimony as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The arm with which I struck was presently disenabled.  
Then it vanished away, and I opened the back-door and  
went out; and, going towards the house-end, I espied said  
Bridget Bishop in her orchard going towards her house, and,  
seeing her, had no power to set one foot forward, but returned in again: and, going to shut the door, I again did see  
that or the like creature, that I before did see within doors,  
in such a posture as it seemed to be agoing to fly at me;  
<pb n="266" id="vII266"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2271">  
<figDesc>Page 266.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
upon which I cried out, `The whole armor of God be between  
me and you.' So it sprang back and flew over the appletree, flinging the dirt with its feet against my stomach, upon  
which I was struck dumb, and so continued for about three  
days' time; and also shook many of the apples off from the  
tree which it flew over.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Before removing to his farm, Edward and Bridget  
Bishop made the alterations, before mentioned, on their  
town estate. John Bly, Sr., aged fifty-seven years, and  
William Bly, aged fifteen, were employed in the operation of removing the cellar wall of &ldquo;the ould house;&rdquo;  
and testified, that they found in holes and crevices  
of said cellar wall &ldquo;several puppets made up of rags  
and hogs' bristles, with headless pins in them with the  
points outward.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Upon such evidence, Bridget Bishop was condemned,  
and executed the next week. The death-warrants, in  
these trials, were collected together in one envelope,  
marked as such. The envelope remains, but its  
contents have all been abstracted. The death-warrant  
of Bridget Bishop was probably overlooked when the  
others were gathered together. The consequence is  
that it has been preserved, and is the only one known  
to be in existence.</p>  
<p>The sheriff seems to have proceeded, immediately  
after the execution, to the clerk's office, and indorsed  
his return on the warrant. When he wrote it, he  
added, after the word &ldquo;dead,&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;and buried her on  
the spot.&rdquo; On its occurring to him that the burying of  
the body was not mentioned in the warrant, he drew

his pen through the words; as is seen in the photograph. This superfluous clause, thus partially obliterated, is the only positive evidence we have of the  
disposal of the bodies at the time. They were undoubtedly all thrown into pits dug among the rocks, on  
the spot, and hastily covered by the officers having in  
charge the details of the executions. There were no  
prayers over their graves, except those uttered by themselves in their last moments.</p>  
<p>The descendants of Bridget Bishop are very numberous in Salem; embracing some of our oldest and most  
respectable families, and branching widely from them.  
There is no evidence of issue by her first marriage.  
Thomas Oliver, her second husband, had daughters by  
a former wife, who were represented in the next generation under the names of Hilliard, Hooper, and  
Jones. By his wife Bridget, he had but one child, &mdash; a  
daughter, Christian, born May 8, 1667. She married  
Thomas Mason, and died in 1693; leaving an only child,  
Susannah, born August 23, 1687. Edward Bishop  
was her guardian. She married John Becket in 1711,  
and by him had a son, John, and six daughters, as  
follows: Susannah, married to David Felt, Elizabeth  
to William Peele, Sarah to Nathaniel Silsbee, Rebecca  
to William Fairfield, Eunice to Thorndike Deland, and  
Hannah to William Cloutman.</p>  
<p>After the condemnation of Bridget Bishop, the Court  
took a recess, and consulted the ministers of Boston  
and the neighborhood respecting the prosecutions.  
The response of the reverend gentlemen, while urging,

</figure>  
in general terms, the importance of caution and circumspection in the methods of examination, decidedly  
and earnestly recommended that the proceedings should  
be vigorously carried on; and they were, indeed, vigorously carried on.</p>  
<p>Hutchinson says, that, &ldquo;at the first trial, there was  
no colony or provincial law against witchcraft in force.  
The statute of James the First must therefore have  
been considered as in force in the province, witchcraft  
not being an offence at common law. Before the adjournment, the old colony law, which makes witchcraft a capital offence, was revived with the other local  
laws, as they were called, and made a law of the province.&rdquo; The General Court, which thus revived the  
law making witchcraft a capital offence, met, June 8,  
two days before the execution of Bridget Bishop. The  
proceedings that took place at Salem were thus assumed as a provincial matter, for which the immediate  
locality was not responsible, but the legislature, clergy,  
and people of the country at large.</p>  
<p>The Court met again on Wednesday, the 29th of  
June; and, after trial, sentenced to death Sarah Good,  
Sarah Wildes, Elizabeth How, Susanna Martin, and  
Rebecca Nurse, who were all executed on the 19th of  
July.</p>  
<p>Calef says, that, at the trial of Sarah Good, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;One of the afflicted fell in a fit; and, after coming out of  
it, cried out of the prisoner for stabbing her in the breast  
with a knife, and that she had broken the knife in stabbing  
of her. Accordingly, a piece of the blade of a knife was  
<pb n="269" id="vII269"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2276">  
<figDesc>Page 269.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
found about her. Immediately, information being given to  
the Court, a young man was called, who produced a half and  
part of the blade, which the Court, having viewed and compared, saw it to be the same; and, upon inquiry, the young  
man affirmed that yesterday he happened to break that knife,  
and that he cast away the upper part, &mdash; this afflicted person  
being then present. The young man was dismissed and she  
was bidden by the Court not to tell lies; and was improved  
after (as she had been before) to give evidence against the  
prisoners.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Hutchinson, in relating this circumstance, refers to  
a case tried before Sir Matthew Hale, when a similar  
kind of falsehood was proved against an &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo;  
witness; notwithstanding which he says the person  
on trial was found guilty, &ldquo;and the judge and all the  
court were fully satisfied with the verdict.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Sarah Good appears to have been an unfortunate  
woman, having been subject to poverty, and consequent sadness and melancholy. But she was not  
wholly broken in spirit. Mr. Noyes, at the time of  
her execution, urged her very strenuously to confess.  
Among other things, he told her &ldquo;she was a witch,  
and that she knew she was a witch.&rdquo; She was conscious of her innocence, and felt that she was oppressed, outraged, trampled upon, and about to be  
murdered, under the forms of law; and her indignation  
was roused against her persecutors. She could not  
bear in silence the cruel aspersion; and, although she  
was just about to be launched into eternity, the torrent  
of her feelings could not be restrained, but burst upon  
<pb n="270" id="vII270"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2277">  
<figDesc>Page 270.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the head of him who uttered the false accusation.  
&ldquo;You are a liar,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I am no more a witch  
than you are a wizard; and, if you take away my  
life, God will give you blood to drink.&rdquo; Hutchinson  
says that, in his day, there was a tradition among the  
people of Salem, and it has descended to the present  
time, that the manner of Mr. Noyes's death strangely  
verified the prediction thus wrung from the incensed  
spirit of the dying woman. He was exceedingly corpulent, of a plethoric habit, and died of an internal  
hemorrhage, bleeding profusely at the mouth.</p>  
<p>We have no information relating to the execution of  
Elizabeth How. Her gentle, patient, humble, benignant, devout, and tender heart bore her, no doubt, with  
a spirit of saint-like love and faith, through the dreadful scenes. We cannot doubt, that, in death as in life,  
she forgave, prayed for, and invoked blessing upon her  
persecutors. Neither has any thing come down in reference to the deportment of Sarah Wildes or Susanna  
Martin. We may take it for granted, that the former  
was a patient and humble, but firm and faithful sufferer; and that the latter displayed the great energy  
of spirit, and probably the strength of language, for  
which she was remarkable. Of the case of Rebecca  
Nurse we have more information.</p>  
<p>The character, age, and position of this venerable  
matron created an impression, which called, to the  
utmost, all the arts and efforts of the prosecution to  
counteract. Many who had gone fully and earnestly  
in support of the proceedings against others paused  
<pb n="271" id="vII271"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2278">  
<figDesc>Page 271.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and hesitated in reference to her; and large numbers  
who had been overawed into silence before, bravely  
came forward in her defence. The character of  
Nathaniel Putnam has been described. He was a man  
of extraordinary strength and acuteness of mind, and  
in all his previous life had been proof against popular  
excitement. The death of his brother Thomas, seven  
years before, had left him the head and patriarch of  
his great family: as such, he was known as &ldquo;Landlord Putnam.&rdquo; Entire confidence was felt by all in his  
judgment, and deservedly. But he was a strong  
religionist, a life-long member of the Church, and extremely strenuous and zealous in his ecclesiastical  
relations. He was getting to be an old man; and Mr.  
Parris had wholly succeeded in obtaining, for the time,  
possession of his feelings, sympathy, and zeal in the  
management of the Church, and secured his full co in the witchcraft prosecutions. He had been  
led by Parris to take the very front in the proceedings.  
But even Nathaniel Putnam could not stand by in  
silence, and see Rebecca Nurse sacrificed. A curious  
paper, written by him, is among those which have been  
preserved: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Nathaniel Putnam,</hi> Sr., being desired by Francis  
Nurse, Sr., to give information of what I could say concerning his wife's life and conversation, I, the abovesaid, have  
known this said aforesaid woman forty years, and what I  
have observed of her, human frailties excepted, her life and  
conversation have been according to her profession; and she  
hath brought up a great family of children and educated  
<pb n="272" id="vII272"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2279">  
<figDesc>Page 272.</figDesc>

them well, so that there is in some of them apparent savor of  
godliness. I have known her differ with her neighbors; but  
I never knew or heard of any that did accuse her of what  
she is now charged with.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>A similar paper was signed by thirty-nine other persons of the village and the immediate vicinity, all of  
the highest respectability. The men and women who  
dared to do this act of justice must not be forgotten: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;We whose names are hereunto subscribed, being desired  
by Goodman Nurse to declare what we know concerning his  
wife's conversation for time past, &mdash; we can testify, to all  
whom it may concern, that we have known her for many  
years; and, according to our observation, her life and conversation were according to her profession, and we never had  
any cause or grounds to suspect her of any such thing as she  
is now accused of.</p>

<p>An examination of the foregoing names in connection with the history of the Village will show conclusive  
proof, that, if the matter had been left to the people  
there, it would never have reached the point to which  
it was carried. It was the influence of the magistracy  
and the government of the colony, and the public  
sentiment prevalent elsewhere, overruling that of the  
immediate locality, that drove on the storm.</p>  
<p>Israel Porter was the head of a great and powerful  
family. His wife Elizabeth was, as has been stated, a  
sister of Hathorne, the examining magistrate. Edward  
and Hannah Bishop were the venerable heads and  
founders of a large family. They lived in Beverly, and  
must each have been about ninety years of age. The  
list contains the names of the heads of the principal  
families in the village, &mdash; such as John and Rebecca  
Putnam, the Hutchinsons, Reas, Leaches, Houltons,  
and Herricks; and, in the neighborhood, such as the  
Feltons, Osbornes, and Samuel Endicott. The most  
remarkable fact it discloses is that it contains the name  
of one of the two complainants who procured the  
warrant against Rebecca Nurse, &mdash; Jonathan Putnam,  
the eldest son of John; and also of his wife Lydia.  
Subsequent reflection, and the return of his better  
judgment, satisfied him that he had done a great wrong  
to an innocent and worthy person; and he had the manliness to come out in her favor. This document ought  
to have been effectual in saving the life of Rebecca  
Nurse. It will for ever vindicate her character, and reflect honor upon each and every name subscribed to it.</p>

<p>One of the most cruel features in the prosecution  
of the witchcraft trials, and which was practised in all  
countries where they took place, was the examination  
of the bodies of the prisoners by a jury of the same  
sex, under the direction and in the presence of a surgeon or physician. The person was wholly exposed,  
and every part subjected to the most searching scrutiny.  
The process was always an outrage upon human nature; and in the cases of the victims on this occasion,  
many of them of venerable years and delicate feelings,  
it was shocking to every natural and instinctive sentiment. There is reason to fear that it was often conducted in a rough, coarse, and brutal manner. Marshal  
Herrick testifies, that, &ldquo;by order of Their Majesties'  
justices,&rdquo; he, accompanied by the jail-keeper Dounton,  
and Constable Joseph Neal, made an examination of  
the body of George Jacobs. In persons of his great  
age, there would, in all likelihood, be shrivelled, desiccated, and callous places. They found one on the old  
man, under his right shoulder. Herrick made oath  
that it was a veritable witch teat, and his deposition  
describes it as follows: &ldquo;About a quarter of an inch  
long or better, with a sharp point drooping downwards,  
so that I took a pin, and run it through the said teat;  
but there was neither water, blood, or corruption, nor  
any other matter.&rdquo; As proof positive that this was  
&ldquo;the Devil's mark,&rdquo; Herrick and the turnkey testify  
that &ldquo;the said jacobs was not in the least sensible of  
what had been done&rdquo;!</p>  
<p>The mind loathes the thought of handling in this  
<pb n="275" id="vII275"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2282">  
<figDesc>Page 275.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
way refined and sensitive females of matronly character, or persons of either sex, with infirmities of  
body rendered sacred by years. The results of the examination were reduced to written reports, going into  
details, and, among other evidences in the trials,  
spread before the Court and jury.<note target="v2n3">*</note></p>  
<p>The evidence in the case of Rebecca Nurse was  
made up of the usual representations and actings of  
the &ldquo;afflicted children.&rdquo; Mary Walcot and Abigail  
Williams charged her with having committed several  
murders; mentioning particularly Benjamin Houlton,  
John Harwood, and Rebecca Shepard, and averring that  
she was aided therein by her sister Cloyse. Mr. Parris,  
too, gave in a deposition against her; from which it appears,  
<pb n="276" id="vII276"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2283">  
<figDesc>Page 276.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that, a certain person being sick, Mercy Lewis  
was sent for. She was struck dumb on entering  
the chamber. She was asked to hold up her hand, if  
she saw any of the witches afflicting the patient.  
Presently she held up her hand, then fell into a  
trance; and after a while, coming to herself, said  
that she saw the spectres of Goody Nurse and Goody  
Carrier having hold of the head of the sick man. Mr.  
Parris swore to this statement with the utmost confidence in Mercy's declarations.</p>  
<p>The testimony of three persons particularly is required to be given, as illustrating the extraordinary  
extent to which the minds of those involved in the  
affair were under infatuation or hallucination.</p>  
<p>Mrs. Ann Putnam was about thirty years of age.  
For six months she had been constantly absorbed in  
what was then, as now, regarded as spiritualism. Her  
<pb n="277" id="vII277"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2284">  
<figDesc>Page 277.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
house had been the scene of a perpetual series of  
wonders supposed to be disclosures and manifestations of a supernatural character. Apparitions, spectral shapes of living witches, ghosts of their murdered  
victims, and demons generally, were of daily and hourly  
occurrence. The dread secrets of the world unknown  
had been revealed to her in waking fancies and dreams  
by night. An originally sensitive and imaginative  
nature had been wrought into a condition in which  
her mental faculties were at once enfeebled and exalted. Besides all this, there were the trials to  
which her constitution had been subjected by the  
experiences of maternity so early begun, and the pressure upon her mind and heart of the anxieties and  
cares incident to a large family of young children.  
An accumulation of disappointments, vexations, and  
consuming griefs, spread like a dark cloud over her  
life, &mdash; the deaths of her own children, and of her sister  
Bayley and her children, and of her sister Baker's children; and, finally, the long-continued, and constantly  
recurring sufferings, tortures, convulsions, fits, and  
trances of her daughter Ann, and her servant-woman  
Mercy Lewis, under, as she fully believed, a diabolical  
hand. &mdash; These things must have given to her countenance and tones of voice a wonderful impressiveness to all who looked upon or listened to them. Her  
eminent social position, her general reputation, &mdash; for  
Lawson, who knew her well, calls her &ldquo;a very sober  
and pious woman,&rdquo; so far as he could judge, &mdash; the  
stamp of profound earnestness marked on all her  
<pb n="278" id="vII278"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2285">  
<figDesc>Page 278.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
language, the glow which morbid excitement long experienced gave to her expression, must have arrested,  
to a high degree, the attention of the assembled multitude. An air of sadness, in the wild ravings of  
imagination, pervades her testimony. I present her  
deposition in full, as one of the phenomena of this  
strange transaction: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> the wife of Thomas  
Putnam, aged about thirty years, who testifieth and saith,  
that, on the 18th March, 1692, I being wearied out in helping to tend my poor afflicted child and maid, about the  
middle of the afternoon I lay me down on the bed to take  
a little rest; and immediately I was almost pressed and  
choked to death, that, had it not been for the mercy of  
a gracious God and the help of those that were with me,  
I could not have lived many moments: and presently I saw  
the apparition of Martha Corey, who did torture me so as  
I cannot express, ready to tear me all to pieces, and then  
departed from me a little while; but, before I could recover  
strength or well take breath, the apparition of Martha  
Corey fell upon me again with dreadful tortures, and hellish  
temptation to go along with her. And she also brought to  
me a little red book in her hand and a black pen, urging me  
vehemently to write in her book; and several times that  
day she did most grievously torture me, almost ready to kill  
me. And, on the 19th March, Martha Corey again appeared  
to me; and also Rebecca Nurse, the wife of Francis Nurse,  
Sr.: and they both did torture me a great many times this  
day with such tortures as no tongue can express, because  
I would not yield to their hellish temptations, that, had I  
not been upheld by an Almighty arm, I could not have lived  
<pb n="279" id="vII279"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2286">  
<figDesc>Page 279.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
while night. The 20th March, being sabbath-day, I had  
a great deal of respite between my fits. 21st March, being  
the day of the examination of Martha Corey, I had not  
many fits, though I was very weak; my strength being,  
as I thought, almost gone: but, on the 22d March, 1692,  
the apparition of Rebecca Nurse did again set upon me in  
a most dreadful manner, very early in the morning, as soon  
as it was well light. And now she appeared to me only in  
her shift, and brought a little red book in her hand, urging  
me vehemently to write in her book; and, because I would  
not yield to her hellish temptations, she threatened to tear  
my soul out of my body, blasphemously denying the blessed  
God, and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to save my soul;  
and denying several places of Scripture which I told her of,  
to repel her hellish temptations. And for near two hours  
together, at this time, the apparition of Rebecca Nurse did  
tempt and torture me, and also the greater part of this  
day, with but very little respite. 23d March, am again  
afflicted by the apparitions of Rebecca Nurse and Martha  
Corey, but chiefly by Rebecca Nurse. 24th March, being the  
day of the examination of Rebecca Nurse, I was several  
times afflicted in the morning by the apparition of Rebecca  
Nurse, but most dreadfully tortured by her in the time of  
her examination, insomuch that the honored magistrates  
gave my husband leave to carry me out of the meeting; and, as soon as I was carried out of the meeting doors, it pleased Almighty God, for his free grace and  
mercy's sake, to deliver me out of the paws of those roaring  
lions, and jaws of those tearing bears, that, ever since that  
time, they have not had power so to afflict me until this  
31st May, 1692. At the same moment that I was hearing  
my evidence read by the honored magistrates, to take my  
<pb n="280" id="vII280"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2287">  
<figDesc>Page 280.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
oath, I was again re-assaulted and tortured by my beforementioned tormentor, Rebecca Nurse.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Ann Putnam,</hi> Jr., witnesseth and  
saith, that, being in the room when her mother was afflicted,  
she saw Martha Corey, Sarah Cloyse, and Rebecca Nurse,  
or their apparition, upon her mother.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Mrs. Ann Putnam made another deposition under  
oath, at the same trial, which shows that she was  
determined to overwhelm the prisoner by the multitude of her charges. She says that Rebecca Nurse's  
apparition declared to her that &ldquo;she had killed Benjamin Houlton, John Fuller, and Rebecca Shepard;&rdquo;  
and that she and her sister Cloyse, and Edward Bishop wife, had killed young John Putnam's child; and  
she further deposed as followeth: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Immediately there did appear to me six children in  
winding-sheets, which called me aunt, which did most  
grievously affright me; and they told me that they were my  
sister Baker's children of Boston; and that Goody Nurse,  
and Mistress Carey of Charlestown, and an old deaf woman  
at Boston, had murdered them, and charged me to go and  
tell these things to the magistrates, or else they would tear  
me to pieces, for their blood did cry for vengeance. Also  
there appeared to me my own sister Bayley and three of  
her children in winding-sheets, and told me that Goody  
Nurse had murdered them.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>There is in this deposition a passage which illustrates one of the doctrines held at the time on the  
subject of witchcraft. Mrs. Ann Putnam &ldquo;testifieth  
and saith, that, on the first day of June, 1692, the  
<pb n="281" id="vII281"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2288">  
<figDesc>Page 281.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
apparition of Rebecca Nurse did again fall upon me,  
and almost choke me; and she told me, that, now she  
was come out of prison, she had power to afflict me,  
and that now she would afflict me all this day long.&rdquo;  
The reference here is probably to the fact, that, on the  
1st of June, she with many other prisoners was transferred from the jail in Boston to that in Salem; and  
that, &ldquo;all that day long&rdquo; being outside of prison  
walls, she had greater power to afflict than when  
chained in a cell. This was undoubtedly the received  
opinion, and it is curiously illustrated in the foregoing passage.</p>  
<p>The only breath of disparagement against the character of Goodwife Nurse that can be found in any  
of the papers is in the following deposition: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Sarah Houlton,</hi> relict of Benjamin Houlton, deceased, who testifieth and saith, that, about  
this time three years, my dear and loving husband, Benjamin  
Houlton, deceased, was as well as ever I knew him in my  
life till one Saturday morning, that Rebecca Nurse, who  
now stands charged for witchcraft, came to our house, and  
fell a railing at him because our pigs got into her field.  
Though our pigs were sufficiently yoked, and their fence was  
down in several places, yet all we could say to her could  
no ways pacify her; but she continued railing and scolding  
a great while together, calling to her son Benj. Nurse to go  
and get a gun and kill our pigs, and let none of them go out  
of the field, though my poor husband gave her never a  
misbeholding word. And, within a short time after this, my  
poor husband going out very early in the morning, as he

</figure>  
was coming in again, he was taken with a strange fit in the  
entry; being struck blind and stricken down two or three  
times, so that, when he came to himself, he told me he  
thought he should never have come into the house any more.  
And, all summer after, he continued in a languishing condition, being much pained at his stomach, and often struck  
blind: but, about a fortnight before he died, he was taken  
with strange and violent fits, acting much like to our poor  
bewitched persons when we thought they would have died;  
and the doctor that was with him could not find what his  
distemper was. And, the day before he died, he was very  
cheerly; but, about midnight, he was again most violently

<p>In explanation of the import of this testimony, it is  
to be observed, that the estate of Benjamin Houlton  
was contiguous to that of Francis Nurse. They were  
separated by a fence, which, as in such cases, was required for half its length to be kept in order by one  
party, the remaining half by the other. What the  
exact facts were cannot be ascertained, as we have  
the story of one side only. The widow Houlton appears to have been a tender-hearted, and, for aught we  
know, good woman. Some years afterwards, she was  
married, as his second wife, to Benjamin Putnam, &mdash; a  
very respectable person, and, on the death of his father  
Nathaniel, the head of that branch of the family. He  
was, for many years, deacon of the church. But she  
was, it must be conceded, a prejudiced witness; and  
<pb n="283" id="vII283"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2290">  
<figDesc>Page 283.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
her judgment for the time was wholly beclouded by  
the prevalent superstitions. The garden had been,  
from the days of Townsend Bishop, a choice portion  
of the Nurse estate. In all farms, it was a most important and valuable item; and was generally under  
the special care and management of the wife, daughters, and younger lads of the husbandman. Rebecca  
Nurse was an efficient helpmeet; contributing her  
whole share to the success of the great enterprise of  
clearing the estate, as well as in bringing up and  
educating a large family. It was, no doubt, very provoking to her, as it would be to any one, to have  
vegetable and flower beds devastated by the ravages of  
a neighbor's stray pigs. To what extent her &ldquo;railing  
and scolding&rdquo; went, she was not allowed to contribute  
her statement, to enable us to judge. The affair  
probably produced considerable gossip, and seems to  
be alluded to in Nathaniel Putnam's certificate in behalf of Rebecca Nurse. There is reason to believe  
that the widow Houlton was one of the first to realize  
what great injustice had been done by her and others  
to the good name of Rebecca Nurse.</p>  
<p>Notwithstanding this evidence, so deeply were the  
jury impressed with the eminent virtue and true  
Christian excellence of this venerable woman, that, in  
spite of the clamors of the outside crowd, the monstrous  
statements of accusing witnesses, and the strong leaning of the Court against her, the jury brought in a  
verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo; Calef, and Hutchinson after  
him, describe the effect, and what followed: &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="284" id="vII284"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2291">  
<figDesc>Page 284.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Immediately, all the accusers in the Court, and, suddenly  
after, all the afflicted out of Court, made an hideous outcry;  
to the amazement, not only of the spectators, but the Court  
also seemed strangely surprised. One of the judges expressed himself not satisfied: another of them, as he was  
going off the bench, said they would have her indicted anew,  
The chief-justice said he would not impose on the jury, but  
intimated as if they had not well considered one expression  
of the prisoner when she was upon trial; viz., that when one  
Hobbs, who had confessed herself to be a witch, was brought  
into Court to witness against her, the prisoner, turning her  
head to her, said, `What! do you bring her? She is one of  
us;' or words to that effect. This, together with the  
clamors of the accusers, induced the jury to go out again,  
after their verdict, `Not guilty.&rdquo;'</p></q>  
<p>The foreman of the jury, Thomas Fisk, made this  
statement on the 4th of July, a few days after the  
trial: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;After the honored Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the verdict, several of the jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon the Court  
gave leave; but, when we came to consider the case, I could  
not tell how to take her words as an evidence against her,  
till she had a further opportunity to put her sense upon them,  
if she would take it. And then, going into Court, I mentioned  
the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court were  
affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the  
bar, but made no reply nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a principal evidence against  
her.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<pb n="285" id="vII285"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2292">  
<figDesc>Page 285.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>Upon being informed of the use made of her words,  
the prisoner put in the following declaration: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;These presents do humbly show to the honored Court  
and jury, that I being informed that the jury brought me  
in guilty upon my saying that Goodwife Hobbs and her  
daughter were of our company; but I intended no otherwise than as they were prisoners with us, and therefore  
did then, and yet do, judge them not legal evidence against  
their fellow-prisoners. And I being something hard of  
hearing and full of grief, none informing me how the Court  
took up my words, and therefore had no opportunity to declare what I intended when I said they were of our company.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It was perfectly natural for her to have spoken of  
them as &ldquo;of our company,&rdquo; not only from the fact  
that they had long been crowded together in the same  
jails, but as they had accompanied each other in the  
transferrence from one jail to another, from time to  
time. A few days before, a large party, of which she  
was one, had been brought from Boston, spending the  
whole day together on the route. Sarah Good, John  
Procter and wife, Susanna Martin, Bridget Bishop,  
and Alice Parker happen to be mentioned as belonging  
to it. Calef further states: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;After her condemnation, the governor saw cause to  
grant a reprieve, which, when known (and some say immediately upon granting), the accusers renewed their dismal outcries against her; insomuch that the governor was by  
some Salem gentlemen prevailed with to recall the reprieve,  
and she was executed with the rest.</p>  
<pb n="286" id="vII286"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2293">  
<figDesc>Page 286.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>&ldquo;The testimonials of her Christian behavior, both in the  
course of her life and at her death, and her extraordinary  
care in educating her children, and setting them a good example, under the hands of so many, are so numerous, that  
for brevity they are here omitted.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The extraordinary conduct of &ldquo;the Salem gentlemen,&rdquo; in preventing the intended exercise of executive  
discretion and clemency on this occasion, is explained,  
it is probable, by the fact, stated by Neal in his &ldquo;History  
of New England,&rdquo; that there was an organized association of private individuals, a committee of vigilance,  
in Salem, during the continuance of the delusion, who  
had undertaken to ferret out and prosecute all suspected persons. He says that many were arrested and  
thrown into prison by their influence and interference.  
It is hardly to be doubted, that the persons who busied  
themselves to prevent the reprieve of Rebecca Nurse  
acted under the authority and by the direction of this  
self-constituted body of inquisitors. The agency of  
such unauthorized and irresponsible combinations is  
always of questionable expediency. When acting in  
the same line with an excited populace, they are extremely dangerous.</p>  
<p>There is no more disgraceful record in the judicial  
annals of the country, than that which relates the trial  
of this excellent woman. The wave of popular fury  
made a clear breach over the judgment-seat. The loud  
and malignant outcry of an infatuated mob, inside  
and outside of the Court-house, instead of being yielded  
to, ought to have been, not only sternly rebuked, but  
<pb n="287" id="vII287"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2294">  
<figDesc>Page 287.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
visited with prompt and exemplary punishment. The  
judges were not only overcome and intimidated from  
the faithful discharge of their sacred duty by a  
clamoring crowd, but they played into their hands.  
Hutchinson justly remarks, that their conduct was in  
violation of that rule to execute &ldquo;law and justice  
in mercy,&rdquo; which ought always to be written on their  
hearts. &ldquo;In a capital case, the Court often refuses a  
verdict of `Guilty;' but rarely, if ever, sends a jury out  
again upon one of `Not guilty.&rdquo;' The statement made  
by the foreman of the jury, with the subsequent explanation of the prisoner, taken in connection with  
the ground on which the chief-justice sent the jury  
out again after rendering their verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo;  
made it the duty of the Court and the executive to  
give to her the benefit of that verdict.</p>  
<p>At the trial of her mother, Sarah Nurse &mdash; aged  
twenty-eight years or thereabouts &mdash; offered this piece  
of testimony: that, &ldquo;being in the Court, this 29th of  
June, 1692, I saw Goodwife Bibber pull pins out of her  
clothes, and held them between her fingers, and clasped  
her hands round her knee; and then she cried out, and  
said, Goody Nurse pinched her.&rdquo; In all these trials,  
Mercy Lewis was a principal witness and actor; yet  
we find, among the papers, testimony from the most  
respectable and reliable persons, that she was not to  
be trusted. There was also testimony which ought  
to have broken the force of the depositions of Ann  
Putnam and her mother. Four days after the examination and commitment of Rebecca Nurse, John  
<pb n="288" id="vII288"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2295">  
<figDesc>Page 288.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Tarbell and Samuel Nurse went to the house of Thomas  
Putnam to find out in what way their mother had been  
made the object of such shocking accusations. They  
were men whose credibility was never brought in question. Their declarations, on this occasion, were not  
disputed, and, if not true, might have been overthrown;  
for there were many witnesses of the facts they stated.  
Tarbell swore as follows: &ldquo;Upon discourse of many  
things, I asked whether the girl that was afflicted did  
first speak of Goody Nurse, before others mentioned  
her to her. They said she told them she saw the  
apparition of a pale-faced woman that sat in her  
grandmother's seat, but did not know her name.  
Then I replied and said, `But who was it that told her  
that it was Goody Nurse?' Mercy Lewis said it was  
Goody Putnam that said it was Goody Nurse. Goody  
Putnam said that it was Mercy Lewis that told her.  
Thus they turned it upon one another, saying, `It was  
you,' and `It was you that told her.&rdquo;' Samuel Nurse  
testified to the same.</p>  
<p>There was another piece of evidence, which, though  
brought against Rebecca Nurse, bears harder, as we  
read it now, upon Ann Putnam than any one else,  
and makes it more difficult to palliate her conduct  
on the supposition of partial insanity. It is, all along,  
one of the obscure problems of our subject to determine how far delusion may have been accompanied by  
fraud and imposture. Edward Putnam testified, that  
&ldquo;Ann Putnam, Jr., was bitten by Rebecca Nurse, as she  
said, about two of the clock of the day&rdquo; after Rebecca  
<pb n="289" id="vII289"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2296">  
<figDesc>Page 289.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Nurse had been committed to jail, and while she was  
several miles distant, in Salem; and the said Nurse also  
struck said Ann Putnam with her spectral chain, leaving  
a mark, &ldquo;being in a kind of a round ring, and three  
streaks across the ring: she had six blows with a chain  
in the space of half an hour; and she had one remarkable one, with six streaks across her arm.&rdquo;  
Edward Putnam swears, &ldquo;I saw the mark, both of bite  
and chains.&rdquo; The Court, no doubt, were solemnly  
impressed by this amazing evidence; but it is hard to  
avoid the conclusion that Ann Putnam was guilty of  
elaborate falsehood and a studied trick.</p>  
<p>In the trials at this session, one of the &ldquo;afflicted  
children&rdquo; cried out against the Rev. Samuel Willard,  
of the Old South Church, in Boston. &ldquo;She was sent  
out of Court, and it was told about that she was mistaken in the person.&rdquo; There was surely evidence  
enough against the honesty and credibility of the  
accusers to leave the judges without excuse, and  
justly meriting perpetual condemnation for not paying heed to it.</p>  
<p>The case of Rebecca Nurse proves that a verdict  
could not have been obtained against a person of her  
character charged with witchcraft in this county, had  
not the most extraordinary efforts been made by the  
prosecuting officer, aided by the whole influence of  
the Court and provincial authorities. The odium of  
the proceedings at the trials and at the executions  
cannot fairly be laid upon Salem, or the people of this  
vicinity.</p>  
<pb n="290" id="vII290"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2297">  
<figDesc>Page 290.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>But nothing can extenuate the infamy that must for  
ever rest upon the names of certain parties to the  
proceedings. Not to attempt here to measure the  
guilt of the accusing witnesses, it may be mentioned  
that it was the deliberate conviction of the family of  
Rebecca Nurse, that Mr. Parris, more than all other  
persons, was responsible for her execution; whether  
by his officious activity in driving on the prosecution,  
or in preventing her reprieve, cannot be known. Of  
the prominent part taken by Mr. Noyes in the cruel  
treatment of this woman, there is no room for doubt.  
The records of the First Church in Salem are darkened by the following entry: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;1692, July 3. &mdash; After sacrament, the elders propounded  
to the church, &mdash; and it was, by an unanimous vote, consented  
to, &mdash; that our sister Nurse, being a convicted witch by the  
Court, and condemned to die, should be excommunicated;  
which was accordingly done in the afternoon, she being  
present.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The scene presented on this occasion must have  
been truly impressive at the time, as it is shocking to  
us in the retrospect. The action of the church, at the  
close of the morning service, of course became universally known; and the &ldquo;great and spacious meeting&rdquo; was thronged by a crowd that filled every  
nook and corner of its floor, galleries, and windows.  
The sheriff and his subordinates brought in the prisoner, manacled, and the chains clanking from her  
aged form. She was placed in the broad aisle. Mr.  
<pb n="291" id="vII291"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2298">  
<figDesc>Page 291.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Higginson and Mr. Noyes &mdash; the elders, as the clergy  
were then called &mdash; were in the pulpit. The two ruling  
elders &mdash; who were lay officers &mdash; and the two deacons  
were in their proper seats, directly below and in front  
of the pulpit. Mr. Noyes pronounced the dread sentence, which, for such a crime, was then believed to be  
not merely an expulsion from the church on earth, but  
an exclusion from the church in heaven. It was meant  
to be understood as an eternal doom. As it had been  
proved, in his estimation, beyond a question, that she  
had given her soul to the Devil, he delivered her over  
to the great adversary of God and man.</p>  
<p>From the dismal cell, which, for but a few days  
longer, was to hold her body, he proclaimed the transferrence of her soul to &mdash;</p>  
<q><lg type="verse">  
<l>&ldquo;A dungeon horrible on all sides round,</l>  
<l>As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames</l>  
<l>No light, but rather darkness visible;</l>  
<l>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</l>  
<l>And rest can never dwell; hope never comes</l>  
<l>That comes to all; but torture without end,</l>  
<l>As far removed from God, and light of heaven,</l>  
<l>As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.&rdquo;</l>  
</lg></q>  
<p>Language and imagery, exhausting the resources of  
the divine genius of the greatest of poets, fail to give  
expression to what was felt to be the import of this  
fearful sentence. It sunk the recipient of it below the  
reach of human sympathy. She was regarded, by that  
blinded multitude, with a horror that cast out pity, and  
was full of hate. But in our view now, and, as we  
believe, in the view of God and angels then, she  
<pb n="292" id="vII292"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2299">  
<figDesc>Page 292.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
occupied an infinite height above her persecutors.  
Her mind was serenely fixed upon higher scenes, and  
filled with a peace which the world could not take  
away, or its cruel wrongs disturb. She went back to  
her prison walls, and then to the scaffold, with a pious  
and humble faith which has not failed to be recorded  
among men, as it has been rewarded where the wicked  
cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.</p>  
<p>Calef, as already quoted, gives the impression produced by her demeanor at her death. Hutchinson  
expresses in the following words the judgment of history and the sense of all coming times: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Mr. Noyes, the minister of Salem, a zealous prosecutor,  
excommunicated the poor old woman, and delivered her  
to Satan, to whom he supposed she had formally given herself up many years before; but her life and conversation  
had been such, that the remembrance thereof, in a short  
time after, wiped off all the reproach occasioned by the civil  
or ecclesiastical sentence against her.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It is impossible to close the story of the lot assigned  
to this good woman by an inscrutable Providence,  
without again contemplating it in a condensed recapitulation. In her old age, experiencing a full share  
of all the delicate infirmities which the instincts of  
humanity require to be treated with careful and reverent tenderness, she was ruthlessly snatched from the  
bosom of a loving family reared by her pious fidelity in  
all Christian graces, from the side of the devoted companion of her long life, from a home that was endeared  
<pb n="293" id="vII293"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2300">  
<figDesc>Page 293.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
by every grateful association and comfort; immured in  
the most wretched and crowded jails; kept loaded with  
irons and bound with cords for months; insulted and  
maligned at the preliminary examinations; outraged  
in her person by rough and unfeeling handling and  
scrutiny; and in her rights, by the most flagrant and  
detestable judicial oppression, by which the benefit of  
a verdict, given in her favor, had been torn away;  
carried to the meeting-house to receive the sentence  
of excommunication in a manner devised to harrow  
her most sacred sentiments; and finally carted through  
the streets by a route every foot of which must have  
been distressing to her infirm and enfeebled frame;  
made to ascend a rough and rocky path to the place  
of execution, and there consigned to the hangman.  
Surely, there has seldom been a harder fate.</p>  
<p>Her body was probably thrown with the rest into a  
hole in the crevices of the rock, and covered hastily  
and thinly over by the executioners. It has been the  
constant tradition of the family, that, in some way, it  
was recovered; and the spot is pointed out in the burialplace belonging to the estate, where her ashes rest by  
the side of her husband, and in the midst of her  
children. It is certain, that, at least, one other body  
was thus exhumed, and taken to its own proper place  
of burial. From the known character of Francis  
Nurse and his sons and sons-in-law, we may be sure  
that what others could do they did not suffer to remain undone. It is left to the imagination to present  
the details of the sad and secret enterprise. In the  
<pb n="294" id="vII294"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2301">  
<figDesc>Page 294.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
darkness of midnight, they found and identified the  
body, and bore it tenderly in their arms along the  
silent roads and by-ways, across fields and over fences,  
to the old home, where it was received by the assembled family, mourned over, and cared for; and, during  
that or the ensuing night, deposited, with tears and  
prayers, in their own consecrated grounds. Her descendants of successive generations owned and reverently guarded the spot. They own and guard it to. The interesting reminiscences connected with  
the early history of the Nurse house have been alluded  
to. It has witnessed an extraordinary variety of the  
conditions of domestic vicissitude. Scenes rising before the mind in contemplative retrospection, while  
gazing upon it, present the extremest contrasts of  
human experience. On the evening of the 25th of  
October, 1678, Mary and Elizabeth Nurse were married. Such an occurrence was undoubtedly the occasion of the highest joy and gladness in a happy  
household. The old mansion shone in light, and  
echoed voices of cheer. How altered its aspect!  
What darkness and silence brooded over and within  
it, while those same daughters waited, watched, and  
listened, through the solemn hours of that night of  
woe and horror, for the coming of their father, husbands, and brothers, bearing to the home, from which  
she had been so cruelly torn, the remains of their  
slaughtered mother!</p>  
<p>The subsequent history of the house presents a  
circumstance of singular interest in connection with  
<pb n="295" id="vII295"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2302">  
<figDesc>Page 295.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
our story. All the members of the three branches of  
the Putnam family, with the exception of Joseph, seem  
to have been carried away by the witchcraft delusion,  
in its early stages, and were more or less active in  
pushing on the prosecutions. We have seen how fierce  
was the maniac testimony of Mrs. Ann Putnam and  
her daughter against Rebecca Nurse. The lapse of  
time, by a Providence that wonderfully works its ends,  
has repaired the breaches made by folly and wrong.  
The descendants of the numerous family of Mrs. Ann  
Putnam have disappeared from the scene: none of  
them bearing the name are in the village. The descendants of Deacon Edward Putnam have also scattered in emigration to other places. Nathaniel and  
John, the heads of the other two branches of the  
family, although involved in the witchcraft delusion,  
each signed papers in favor of Rebecca Nurse; their  
descendants, as well as those of Joseph, are still  
numerous in the village, hold their old position of  
respectability and influence, and many of them occupy  
the lands of their ancestors. Stephen, the grandson  
of Nathaniel, married Miriam, the grand-daughter of  
John. Their son Phinehas, in 1784, bought the Nurse  
homestead from Benjamin Nurse, the great-grandson  
of Rebecca. Orin Putnam, the great-grandson of  
Phinehas, to whom the estate descends, married in  
1836 the daughter of Allen Nurse, a direct descendant  
of Rebecca, and placed her at the head of her old ancestral homestead. The children of that marriage,  
with their father and grandfather, constitute the family  
<pb n="296" id="vII296"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2303">  
<figDesc>Page 296.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that dwell in and own the venerable mansion. This  
singular restoration, suggesting such pleasing sentiments, adds another to the remarkable elements of interest belonging to the history of the Townsend-Bishop  
House.</p>  
<p>The descendants of Francis and Rebecca Nurse  
are numerous, and have honorably perpetuated the  
name. Among them may be mentioned the Rev.  
Peter Nurse, a graduate of Harvard College in 1802,  
for some years librarian of that institution, an excellent  
scholar, and long universally respected as a clergyman; and Amos Nurse, a graduate of the same  
college in 1812, &mdash; an eminent physician connected with  
the medical faculty of Bowdoin College, a man of distinguished talent and influence in public affairs, and  
senator in Congress from the State of Maine.</p>  
<p>The Court met again on the 5th of August, and  
tried George Burroughs; John Procter and Elizabeth,  
his wife; George Jacobs, Sr.; John Willard; and  
Martha Carrier. They were all condemned, and, with  
the exception of Elizabeth Procter, executed on the  
19th of the same month.</p>  
<p>Hutchinson describes the trial of Burroughs. After  
speaking of the evidence of the &ldquo;afflicted persons&rdquo;  
and the confessing witches, he mentions other circumstances which were thought to corroborate it: &ldquo;One  
was, that, being a little man, he had performed feats  
beyond the strength of a giant; viz., had held out a  
gun of seven feet barrel with one hand, and had carried  
a barrel full of cider from a canoe to the shore.&rdquo; Burroughs  
<pb n="297" id="vII297"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2304">  
<figDesc>Page 297.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
said that an Indian present at the time did the  
same. Instantly, the accusers said it was &ldquo;the black  
man, or the Devil, who,&rdquo; they swore, &ldquo;looks like an  
Indian.&rdquo; Another piece of evidence was, that he  
went from one place to another, on a certain occasion,  
in a shorter time than was possible had not the Devil  
helped him. He said, in answer, that another man accompanied him. Their reply to this was, that it was  
the Devil, using the appearance of another man. So  
whatever he said was turned against him. Hutchinson says, &ldquo;Upon the whole, he was confounded,  
and used many twistings and turnings, which, I think,  
we cannot wonder at.&rdquo; This fair and judicious writer,  
like Brattle, appears in the foregoing remark to have  
adopted the common scandal, put in circulation by  
parties interested to disparage Mr. Burroughs. The  
papers in this case, that have come down to us, are  
more numerous than in reference to many others  
among the sufferers; and they do not bear such an  
impression. Mr. Burroughs was astounded at the  
monstrous folly and falsehood with which he was surrounded. He was a man without guile, and incapable  
of appreciating such wickedness. He tried, in simplicity and ingenuousness, to explain what was brought  
against him; and this, probably, was all the &ldquo;twisting  
and turning&rdquo; he exhibited.</p>  
<p>Hutchinson had the benefit of consulting all the  
papers belonging to this and other trials; but neither  
he nor Calef seems to have noticed one remarkable  
fact: many of the depositions, how many we cannot  
<pb n="298" id="vII298"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2305">  
<figDesc>Page 298.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
tell, were procured after the trials were over, and surreptitiously foisted in among the papers to bolster up  
the proceedings. We find, for instance, the following  
deposition: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Greenslitt,</hi> aged about forty years, being  
deposed, testifieth that, about the first breaking-out of this  
last Indian war, being at the house of Captain Joshua  
Scotto at Black Point, he saw Mr. George Burrows, who  
was lately executed at Salem, lift a gun of six-foot barrel  
or thereabouts, putting the forefinger of his right hand into  
the muzzle of said gun, and that he held it out at arms'  
end, only with that finger: and further this deponent testifieth,  
that, at the same time, he saw the said Burrows take up a  
full barrel of molasses with but two of the fingers of one of  
his hands in the bung, and carry it from the stage head to the  
door at the end of the stage, without letting it down; and that  
Lieutenant Richard Hunniwell and John Greenslitt were then  
present, and some others that are dead. Sept. 15, '92.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Not only the date to this deposition, but its express  
language, proves that it could not have been used at the  
trial. There is another, to the same effect and of the  
same date, that is, nearly a month after Burroughs was  
thrown into his grave. There are others of the same  
kind. This stamps the management of the prosecutions,  
and of those concerned in the charge of the papers,  
with an irregularity of the grossest kind, which partakes  
strongly of the character of fraud and falsehood.</p>  
<p>When it was found that there was beginning to  
grow up a want of confidence in &ldquo;spectre evidence&rdquo;  
and the testimony of the afflicted children, those concerned  
<pb n="299" id="vII299"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2306">  
<figDesc>Page 299.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in the prosecutions became alarmed lest a  
re-action of public sentiment might take place. The  
persons who had brought Mr. Burroughs to his death  
concluded that their best escape from public indignation was to accumulate evidence against him after  
he was in his grave, particularly on the point of his  
superhuman strength; and they got up these depositions, and caused them to be put among the papers  
on file. Great stress was laid, by those who were  
interested in damaging his character and suppressing  
sympathy in his fate, upon this particular proof of  
his having been in confederacy with the Devil. Increase Mather said, that, in his judgment, it was conclusive evidence that he &ldquo;had the Devil to be his  
familiar,&rdquo; and that, had he been on the jury, he could  
not, on this account, have concurred in a verdict of  
acquittal; and Cotton Mather, feeling the importance  
of making the most of Mr. Burroughs's extraordinary  
strength, gives way to his tendency to indulge in the  
marvellous, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;God had been pleased so to leave this George Burroughs, that he had ensnared himself by several instances  
which he had formerly given of preternatural strength,  
and which were now produced against him. He was a very  
puny man, yet he had often done things beyond the strength  
of a giant. A gun of about seven-foot barrel, and so heavy  
that strong men could not steadily hold it out with both  
hands, &mdash; there were several testimonies given in by persons  
of credit and honor, that he made nothing of taking up  
such a gun behind the lock with but one hand, and holding  
it out, like a pistol, at arms' end. Yea, there were two  
<pb n="300" id="vII300"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2307">  
<figDesc>Page 300.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
testimonies, that George Burroughs, with only putting the  
forefinger of his right hand into the muzzle of a heavy gun,  
a fowling-piece of about six or seven foot barrel, did lift  
up the gun, and hold it out at arms' end, &mdash; a gun which the  
deponents thought strong men could not with both hands  
lift up, and hold at the butt end, as is usual.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It is further observable, in reference to the foregoing deposition from Greenslitt, that it was given  
six days after the condemnation of his mother, Ann  
Pudeator, and a week before her execution. Cotton  
Mather says that he &ldquo;was overpersuaded by others  
to be out of the way upon George Burroughs's trial,&rdquo;  
six weeks before. He did not fail, however, to come  
to Salem to be with his mother at her trial and until  
her death, and being here was compelled to give his  
deposition. His mother's life was at the mercy of  
the prosecutors; and he was tempted, in the vain hope  
of conciliating that mercy, to gratify them by making  
the statement about Burroughs a month after his  
execution, and whom it could not then harm. What  
he said was probably no more than the truth. It has  
been found that the power of the human muscles can  
be cultivated to a surprising extent; and the feats  
ascribed to Burroughs, without making much allowance for a natural degree of exaggeration, have been  
fully equalled in our day.</p>  
<p>Calef gives the following account of his execution: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Mr. Burroughs was carried in a cart with the others,  
through the streets of Salem, to execution. When he was  
upon the ladder, he made a speech for the clearing of his  
<pb n="301" id="vII301"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2308">  
<figDesc>Page 301.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
innocency, with such solemn and serious expressions as  
were to the admiration of all present. His prayer (which  
he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well  
worded, and uttered with such composedness and such (at  
least seeming) fervency of spirit, as was very affecting, and  
drew tears from many, so that it seemed to some that the  
spectators would hinder the execution. The accusers said  
the black man stood and dictated to him. As soon as he  
was turned off, Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a  
horse, addressed himself to the people, partly to declare that  
he (Mr. Burroughs) was no ordained minister, and partly  
to possess the people of his guilt, saying that the Devil often  
had been transformed into an angel of light; and this somewhat appeased the people, and the executions went on. When  
he was cut down, he was dragged by a halter to a hole, or  
grave, between the rocks, about two feet deep; his shirt and  
breeches being pulled off, and an old pair of trousers of one  
executed put on his lower parts: he was so put in, together  
with Willard and Carrier, that one of his hands, and his  
chin, and a foot of one of them, was left uncovered.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Cotton Mather, not satisfied with this display of  
animosity, at a moment when every human heart, however imbittered by prejudice, is hushed for the time  
in solemn silence, attempts, in an account afterwards  
given of Mr. Burroughs's trial, to blacken his character by an elaborate dressing-up of the absurd stories  
told by the accusers, and a perverse misrepresentation of the demeanor of the accused. He relates with  
apparent glee what was regarded as a wonderful  
achievement of adroitness on the part of Chief-justice  
Stoughton in trapping Mr. Burroughs, and putting  
the laugh upon him in Court.</p>  
<pb n="302" id="vII302"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2309">  
<figDesc>Page 302.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;It cost the Court a wonderful deal of trouble to hear  
the testimonies of the sufferers; for, when they were going  
to give in their depositions, they would for a long while  
be taken with fits, that made them quite uncapable of saying  
any thing. The chief judge asked the prisoner, who he  
thought hindered these witnesses from giving their testimonies; and he answered, he supposed it was the Devil. The  
honorable person then replied, `How comes the Devil so  
loath to have any testimony borne against you?' Which  
cast him into very great confusion.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>From what fell from him, at the preliminary examination, it is evident that it did not occur to him  
as a possibility that human nature could be capable  
of the guilt of such a wilful fabrication and imposture  
on the part of the &ldquo;afflicted children.&rdquo; He beheld  
their sufferings, and he knew his own innocence. He  
felt, whatever his theological creed might have been,  
that a Devil was required to explain the mystery.  
The apparent sufferings of the accusing witnesses convinced Court, jury, and all, of the guilt of the accused.  
The logic of the chief-justice was perfectly absurd.  
For, if the Devil caused the sufferings, he was an adverse  
party to the prisoner. This, however, overthrows the  
whole theory of the prosecution, which was that the prisoner and the Devil were in league with each other. But  
the judge, jury, and people, all equally blinded and  
stupefied by the delusion, did not see it; and they  
chuckled over the alleged confusion of the prisoner.  
All thoughtful persons will concur in Mr. Burroughs's  
opinion, that, if ever a diabolical power had possession  
<pb n="303" id="vII303"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2310">  
<figDesc>Page 303.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of human beings, it was in the case of the wretched  
creatures who enacted the part of the accusing girls  
in the witchcraft proceedings. In his account of the  
trial, Mather makes statements which show that he  
was privy to the fact, that testimony, subsequently  
taken, was lodged with the evidence belonging to the  
case. The documents prove that it was done to an  
extent beyond what he acknowledges.</p>  
<p>Considering that none dared to show the least sympathy with the persons on trial, that they had none to  
counsel or stand by them, that the public passions  
were incensed against them as against no other persons ever charged with crime, &mdash; it being vastly more  
flagrant than any other crime, a rebellion against  
heaven and earth, God and man; a deliberate selling of  
the soul to the Arch-enemy of souls for the ruin of all  
other souls, &mdash; in view of all these things, it is truly astonishing, that, by the documents themselves, proceeding, as in almost all cases they do, from hostile and  
imbittered sources, we are compelled to the conviction,  
that, in their imprisonments, trials, and deaths, the  
victims of this savage delusion manifested &mdash; in most  
cases eminently, and in all substantially &mdash; the marks,  
not only of innocent, but of elevated and heroic minds.  
A review of what can be gleaned in reference to  
Mr. Burroughs at Casco Bay and Salem Village, and  
a considerate survey and scrutiny of all that has  
reached us from the day of his arrest to the moment  
of his death, have left a decided impression, that he  
was an able, intelligent, true-minded man; ingenuous,  
<pb n="304" id="vII304"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2311">  
<figDesc>Page 304.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
sincere, humble in his spirit; faithful and devoted as a  
minister; and active, generous, and disinterested as  
a citizen. His descendants, under his own name and  
the names of Newman, Fowle, Holbrook, Fox, Thomas,  
and others, have been numerous and respectable. The  
late Isaiah Thomas, LL.D., was one of them.</p>  
<p>From the account given of John Procter, in the  
First Part, it is apparent that he was a person of  
decided character, and, although impulsive and liable  
to be imprudent, of a manly spirit, honest, earnest,  
and bold in word and deed. He saw through the  
whole thing, and was convinced that it was the result  
of a conspiracy, deliberate and criminal, on the part of  
the accusers. He gave free utterance to his indignation at their conduct, and it cost him his life.</p>  
<p>A few days before his trial, he made his will. There  
is no reference in it to his particular situation. His  
signature to the document is accurately represented  
among the autographs given in this work. It was  
written while the manacles were on him. Notwithstanding the danger to which any one was exposed who  
expressed sympathy for convicted or accused persons,  
or doubt of their guilt, a large number had the manliness to try to save this worthy and honest citizen.  
John Wise, one of the ministers of Ipswich, heads  
the list of petitioners from that place. The document  
is in his handwriting. Thirty-one others joined in the  
act, many of them among the most respectable citizens  
of that town. Mr. Wise was a learned, able, and  
enlightened man. He had a free spirit, and was perhaps  
<pb n="305" id="vII305"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2312">  
<figDesc>Page 305.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the only minister in the neighborhood or country,  
who was discerning enough to see the erroneousness of  
the proceedings from the beginning. The petition is  
as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble and Sincere Declaration of us, Subscribers,  
Inhabitants in Ipswich, on the Behalf of our Neighbors,  
John Procter and his Wife, now in Trouble and  
under Suspicion of Witchcraft.</hi></p>  
<p rend="center">&ldquo;TO THE HONORABLE COURT OF ASSISTANTS NOW SITTING  
IN BOSTON.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Honored and Right Worshipful,</hi> &mdash; The aforesaid John  
Procter may have great reason to justify the Divine Sovereignty of God under these severe remarks of Providence  
upon his peace and honor, under a due reflection upon his  
life past; and so the best of us have reason to adore the  
great pity and indulgence of God's providence, that we are  
not exposed to the utmost shame that the Devil can invent,  
under the permissions of sovereignty, though not for that  
sin forenamed, yet for our many transgressions. For we do  
at present suppose, that it may be a method within the severer but just transactions of the infinite majesty of God,  
that he sometimes may permit Sathan to personate, dissemble, and thereby abuse innocents and such as do, in the  
fear of God, defy the Devil and all his works. The great  
rage he is permitted to attempt holy Job with; the abuse he  
does the famous Samuel in disquieting his silent dust, by  
shadowing his venerable person in answer to the charms of  
witchcraft; and other instances from good hands, &mdash; may be  
arguments. Besides the unsearchable footsteps of God's  
judgments, that are brought to light every morning, that astonish  
<pb n="306" id="vII306"/>

</figure>  
our weaker reasons; to teach us adoration, trembling,  
dependence, &amp;c. But we must not trouble Your Honors by  
being tedious. Therefore, being smitten with the notice of  
what hath happened, we reckon it within the duties of our  
charity, that teacheth us to do as we would be done by, to  
offer thus much for the clearing of our neighbors' innocency;  
viz., that we never had the least knowledge of such a nefandous wickedness in our said neighbors, since they have  
been within our acquaintance. Neither do we remember  
any such thoughts in us concerning them, or any action by  
them or either of them, directly tending that way, no more  
than might be in the lives of any other persons of the clearest reputation as to any such evils. What God may have  
left them to, we cannot go into God's pavilion clothed with  
clouds of darkness round about; but, as to what we have  
ever seen or heard of them, upon our consciences we judge  
them innocent of the crime objected. His breeding hath  
been amongst us, and was of religious parents in our place,  
and, by reason of relations and properties within our town,  
hath had constant intercourse with us. We speak upon our  
personal acquaintance and observation; and so leave our  
neighbors, and this our testimony on their behalf, to the wise  
thoughts of Your Honors.</p>

<p>Their neighbors living near the bounds of the village  
presented the following paper, in the handwriting of  
Felton, the first signer. From the appearance of the  
document, it seems that a portion of it, probably containing an equal number of names, has been cut out  
by scissors.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;We whose names are underwritten, having several  
years known John Procter and his wife, do testify that  
we never heard or understood that they were ever suspected  
to be guilty of the crime now charged upon them; and several of us, being their near neighbors, do testify, that, to our  
apprehension, they lived Christian-like in their family, and

<p>In addition to this testimony in their favor, evidence  
was offered, at their trial, that one of the accusing  
<pb n="308" id="vII308"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2315">  
<figDesc>Page 308.</figDesc>

witnesses had denied, out of Court, what she had  
sworn to in Court; and declared that she must, at the  
time, have been &ldquo;out of her head,&rdquo; and that she had  
never intended to accuse them. It was further proved,  
that another of the accusing witnesses acknowledged  
that she had sworn falsely, and tried to explain away  
her testimony in Court, acknowledging that what the  
girls said was &ldquo;for sport. They must have some  
sport.&rdquo; But neither the testimony in their favor from  
those who had known them through life, nor the palpable and decisive manner in which the evidence  
against them had been impeached and exposed, could  
open the eyes of the infatuated Court and jury.</p>  
<p>After his conviction, he requested, in vain, time  
enough to prepare himself for death, and make the  
necessary arrangements of his business and for the  
welfare of his family; and the statement has come  
down to us, that Mr. Noyes refused to pray with him,  
unless he would confess himself guilty. The following  
letter, addressed by him to the ministers named, in  
behalf of himself and fellow-prisoners, gives a truly  
shocking account of the outrages connected with the  
prosecutions. It illustrates the courage of the writer  
in exposing them, and is a sensible and manly appeal  
and remonstrance. There is ground for supposing  
that the ministers addressed were known not to be  
entirely carried away by the delusion. The fact that  
Mr. Mather &mdash; meaning, of course, Increase Mather &mdash;  
is the first named, corroborates other evidence that he  
was beginning to entertain doubts about the propriety  
<pb n="309" id="vII309"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2316">  
<figDesc>Page 309.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of the proceedings. Of the Rev. James Allen, much  
has been said in connection with the Townsend-Bishop  
farm. He had been a clergyman in England, and was  
silenced by the Act of Uniformity, in 1662. He came  
to New England; and, after officiating as an assistant  
to the Rev. Mr. Davenport, in the First Church at Boston, for six years, was ordained as its preacher in 1668.  
He was of independent fortune, and subsequently took  
a leading part with those opposed to the party that had  
favored the witchcraft prosecutions. He must have  
known Rebecca Nurse quite intimately, and much of  
the influence used in her favor, and which almost saved  
her, may be attributed to him; there was a particular  
intimacy between him and Increase Mather, and together they held Cotton Mather somewhat in check,  
occasionally at least. The Rev. Joshua Moody had  
been settled in the ministry at Portsmouth, New  
Hampshire. In the maintenance of the principles of  
religious liberty he suffered a long imprisonment, and  
was afterwards exiled by arbitrary power. He was  
then invited to the First Church in Boston, where he  
preached from 1684 to 1693, when he returned to  
Portsmouth. He died in 1697. By his active exertions, Mr. and Mrs. English were enabled to escape  
from the jail at Boston. The Rev. Samuel Willard,  
pastor of the Old South Church in Boston, was one of  
the most revered and beloved ministers in the country.  
His publications were numerous, learned, and valuable;  
consisting of discourses, tracts, and volumes. His  
&ldquo;Body of Divinity&rdquo; is an elaborate and systematic  
<pb n="310" id="vII310"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2317">  
<figDesc>Page 310.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
work, comprising two hundred and fifty lectures on the  
Assembly's Catechism. That Procter was not in error  
in supposing Mr. Willard open to reason on the subject is demonstrated by the fact, that the &ldquo;afflicted  
girls&rdquo; were beginning to cry out against this eminent  
divine. The Rev. John Bailey was one of the ejected  
ministers who had here sought refuge from oppression  
in the mother-country. He was a distinguished person, associated with Mr. Allen and Mr. Moody in  
the ministry of the First Church at Boston. Cotton  
Mather made him the subject of the strongest eulogium in his &ldquo;Magnalia.&rdquo; Procter addressed his letter  
to these persons because he believed them to be superior in wisdom and candid in spirit. It cannot be  
doubted that the good men did what they could in  
his behalf, but in vain.</p>

so much enraged and incensed against us by the delusion of  
the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason we know,  
in our own consciences, we are all innocent persons. Here  
are five persons who have lately confessed themselves to be  
witches, and do accuse some of us of being along with them  
at a sacrament, since we were committed into close prison,  
which we know to be lies. Two of the five are (Carrier's  
sons) young men, who would not confess any thing till they  
tied them neck and heels, till the blood was ready to come  
out of their noses; and it is credibly believed and reported  
this was the occasion of making them confess what they  
never did, by reason they said one had been a witch a  
month, and another five weeks, and that their mother made  
them so, who has been confined here this nine weeks. My  
son, William Procter, when he was examined, because he  
would not confess that he was guilty, when he was innocent,  
they tied him neck and heels till the blood gushed out at his  
nose, and would have kept him so twenty-four hours, if one,  
more merciful than the rest, had not taken pity on him, and  
caused him to be unbound.</p>

have already undone us in our estates, and that will not  
serve their turns without our innocent blood. If it cannot

beg that you would endeavor to have these magistrates  
changed, and others in their room; begging also and beseeching you, that you would be pleased to be here, if not  
all, some of you, at our trials, hoping thereby you may be  
the means of saving the shedding of our innocent blood.  
Desiring your prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest,

<p>The bitterness of the prosecutors against Procter  
was so vehement, that they not only arrested, and tried  
to destroy, his wife and all his family above the age of  
infancy, in Salem, but all her relatives in Lynn, many  
of whom were thrown into prison. The helpless  
children were left destitute, and the house swept of  
its provisions by the sheriff. Procter's wife gave  
birth to a child, about a fortnight after his execution.  
This indicates to what alone she owed her life.</p>  
<p>John Procter had spoken so boldly against the proceedings, and all who had part in them, that it was  
felt to be necessary to put him out of the way. He  
had denounced the entire company of the accusers, and  
their revenge demanded his sacrifice. They brought  
the whole power of their cunning and audacious arts  
to bear against him, and pursued him to the death  
with violence and rage. The manly and noble deportment exhibited in his dying hour seems to have made  
a deep impression on the minds of some, and gave  
an effectual blow to the delusion. The descendants  
of John Procter have always understood that his remains were recovered from the spot where the hangman deposited them, and placed in his own grounds,  
where they rest to-day.</p>  
<p>No account has come to us of the deportment of  
George Jacobs, Sr., at his execution. As he was remarkable in life for the firmness of his mind, so he  
probably was in death. He had made his will before  
the delusion arose. It is dated Jan. 29, 1692; and  
shows that he, like Procter, had a considerable estate.

Bartholomew Gedney is one of the attesting witnesses,  
and probably wrote the document. After his conviction, on the 12th of August, he caused another to be  
written, which, in its provisions, reflects light upon the  
 
state of mind produced by the condition in which he  
found himself. In his infirm old age, he had been condemned to die for a crime of which he knew himself  
innocent, and which there is some reason to believe he  
did not think any one capable of committing. He regarded the whole thing as a wicked conspiracy and  
absurd fabrication. He had to end his long life upon a  
scaffold in a week from that day. His house was desolated, and his property sequestered. His only son,  
charged with the same crime, had eluded the sheriff,  
&mdash; leaving his family, in the hurry of his flight, unprovided for &mdash; and was an exile in foreign lands. The  
crazy wife of that son was in prison and in chains,  
waiting trial on the same charge; her little children,  
including an unweaned infant, left in a deserted and  
destitute condition in the woods. The older children  
were scattered, he knew not where, while one of them  
had completed the bitterness of his lot by becoming  
a confessor, upon being arrested with her mother as a  
witch. This grand-daughter, Margaret, overwhelmed  
with fright and horror, bewildered by the statements  
of the accusers, and controlled probably by the arguments and arbitrary methods of address employed by  
her minister, Mr. Noyes, &mdash; whose peculiar function in  
these proceedings seems to have been to drive persons  
accused to make confession &mdash; had been betrayed into  
<pb n="316" id="vII316"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2323">  
<figDesc>Page 316.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that position, and became a confessor, and accuser of  
others. Under these circumstances, the old man made  
a will, giving to his son George his estates, and securing the succession of them to his male descendants.  
But, in the mean while, without his then knowing  
it, Margaret had recalled her confession, as appears  
from the following documents, which tell their own  
story: &mdash;</p>  
</div3>  
<div3 type="letter">  
<head></head>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble Declaration of Margaret Jacobs unto the  
Honored Court now sitting at Salem showeth,</hi> that, whereas  
your poor and humble declarant, being closely confined  
here in Salem jail for the crime of witchcraft, &mdash; which  
crime, thanks be to the Lord! I am altogether ignorant of,  
as will appear at the great day of judgment, &mdash; may it please  
the honored Court, I was cried out upon by some of the  
possessed persons as afflicting them; whereupon I was  
brought to my examination; which persons at the sight of  
me fell down, which did very much startle and affright me.  
The Lord above knows I knew nothing in the least measure  
how or who afflicted them. They told me, without doubt I  
did, or else they would not fall down at me; they told me, if  
I would not confess, I should be put down into the dungeon,  
and would be hanged, but, if I would confess, I should  
have my life: the which did so affright me, with my own  
vile, wicked heart, to save my life, made me make the like  
confession I did, which confession, may it please the honored  
Court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night  
after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I could not sleep, for fear the Devil should carry  
me away for telling such horrid lies. I was, may it please  
the honored Court, sworn to my confession, as I understand

since; but then, at that time, was ignorant of it, not knowing  
what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I  
trust, out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me  
my false forswearing myself. What I said was altogether  
false against my grandfather and Mr. Burroughs, which I  
did to save my life, and to have my liberty: but the Lord,  
charging it to my conscience, made me in so much horror,  
that I could not contain myself before I had denied my confession, which I did, though I saw nothing but death before  
me; choosing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to  
live in such horror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon  
my denying my confession, I was committed to close prison,  
where I have enjoyed more felicity in spirit, a thousand  
times, than I did before in my enlargement. And now,  
may it please Your Honors, your declarant having in part  
given Your Honors a description of my condition, do leave it  
to Your Honors' pious and judicious discretions to take pity  
and compassion on my young and tender years, to act and  
do with me as the Lord above and Your Honors shall see  
good, having no friend but the Lord to plead my cause for  
me; not being guilty, in the least measure, of the crime of  
witchcraft, nor any other sin that deserves death from man.  
And your poor and humble declarant shall for ever pray, as  
she is bound in duty, for Your Honors' happiness in this life,  
and eternal felicity in the world to come. So prays Your  
Honors' declarant,</p>

<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Honored Father,</hi> &mdash; After my humble duty remembered to you, hoping in the Lord of your good health, as,  
blessed be God! I enjoy, though in abundance of affliction,  
being close confined here in a loathsome dungeon: the Lord  
look down in mercy upon me, not knowing how soon I shall  
be put to death, by means of the afflicted persons; my  
grandfather having suffered already, and all his estate  
seized for the king. The reason of my confinement is this:  
I having, through the magistrates' threatenings, and my own  
vile and wretched heart, confessed several things contrary  
to my conscience and knowledge, though to the wounding of  
my own soul; (the Lord pardon me for it!) but, oh! the terrors of a wounded conscience who can bear? But, blessed  
be the Lord! he would not let me go on in my sins, but in  
mercy, I hope, to my soul, would not suffer me to keep it  
any longer: but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the magistrates, who would not believe me; but it is  
their pleasure to put me in here, and God knows how soon  
I shall be put to death. Dear father, let me beg your  
prayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a joyful and  
happy meeting in heaven. My mother, poor woman, is very  
crazy, and remembers her kind love to you, and to uncle;  
viz., D. A. So, leaving you to the protection of the Lord,  
I rest, your dutiful daughter,</p>

<p>A temporary illness led to the postponement of her  
trial; and, before the next sitting of the Court, the  
delusion had passed away.</p>  
<p>The &ldquo;uncle D. A.,&rdquo; referred to, was Daniel Andrew, their nearest neighbor, who had escaped at the  
<pb n="319" id="vII319"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2326">  
<figDesc>Page 319.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
same time with her father. She calls him &ldquo;uncle.&rdquo;  
He was, it is probable, a brother of John Andrew who  
had married Ann Jacobs, sister of her father. Words  
of relationship were then used with a wide sense.</p>  
<p>Margaret read the recantation of her confession  
before the Court, and was, as she says, forthwith  
ordered by them into a dungeon. She obtained permission to visit Mr. Burroughs the day before his  
execution, acknowledged that she had belied him,  
and implored his forgiveness. He freely forgave, and  
prayed with her and for her. It is probable, that,  
at the same time, she obtained an interview with her  
grandfather for the same purpose. At any rate, the  
old man heard of her heroic conduct, and forthwith  
crowded into the space between two paragraphs in  
his will, in small letters closely written (the jailer  
probably being the amanuensis), a clause giving a legacy of &ldquo;ten pounds to be paid in silver&rdquo; to his grand, Margaret Jacobs. There is the usual declaration, that it &ldquo;was inserted before sealing and  
signing.&rdquo; This will having been made after conviction and sentence to death, and having but two  
witnesses, one besides the jailer, was not allowed in  
Probate, but remains among the files of that Court.  
As a link in the foregoing story, it is an interesting  
relic. The legacy clause, although not operative, was  
no doubt of inexpressible value to the feelings of Margaret: and the circumstance seems to have touched  
the heart even of the General Court, nearly twenty  
years afterwards; for they took pains specifically to  
<pb n="320" id="vII320"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2327">  
<figDesc>Page 320.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
provide to have the same sum paid to Margaret, out  
of the Province treasury.</p>  
<p>She was not tried at the time appointed, in consequence, it is stated, of &ldquo;an imposthume in the head,&rdquo;  
and finally escaped the fate to which she chose to  
consign herself, rather than remain under a violated  
conscience. In judging of her, we cannot fail to make  
allowance for her &ldquo;young and tender years,&rdquo; and to  
sympathize in the sufferings through which she passed.  
In making confession, and in accusing others, she had  
done that which filled her heart with horror, in the  
retrospect, so long as she lived. In recanting it, and  
giving her body to the dungeon, and offering her life  
at the scaffold, she had secured the forgiveness of  
Mr. Burroughs and her aged grandfather, and deserves our forgiveness and admiration. Every human  
heart must rejoice that this young girl was saved.  
She lived to be a worthy matron and the founder  
of a numerous and respectable family.</p>

<note id="v2n3"><p>* A few days before her trial, Rebecca Nurse was subjected to this  
inspection and exploration; and the jury of women found the witchmark upon her. On the 28th of June, two days before the meeting of  
the Court, she addressed to that body the following communication: &mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The humble petition of Rebecca Nurse, of Salem Village, humbly  
showeth: That whereas some women did search your petitioner at Salem,  
as I did then conceive for some supernatural mark; and then one of the  
said women, which is known to be the most ancient, skilful, prudent person  
of them all as to any such concern, did express herself to be of a contrary  
opinion from the rest, and did then declare that she saw nothing in or about  
Your Honor's poor petitioner but what might arise from a natural cause, &mdash; I  
there rendered the said persons a sufficient known reason as to myself of the  
moving cause thereof, which was by exceeding weaknesses, descending partly  
from an overture of nature, and difficult exigencies that hath befallen me in  
the times of my travails. And therefore your petitioner humbly prays  
that Your Honors would be pleased to admit of some other women to inquire into this great concern, those that are most grave, wise, and skilful;  
namely, Mrs. Higginson, Sr., Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Woodbury, &mdash; two of them  
being midwives, Mrs. Porter, together with such others as may be chosen  
on that account, before I am brought to my trial. All which I hope your  
honors will take into your prudent consideration, and find it requisite so to  
do; for my life lies now in your hands, under God. And, being conscious of  
my own innocency, I humbly beg that I may have liberty to manifest it to  
the world partly by the means abovesaid.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And your poor petitioner shall evermore pray, as in duty bound, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p></q>

Goody Nurse hath been troubled with an infirmity of body for many years,

<p>George Jacobs, Sr., is the only one, among the victims of the witchcraft prosecutions, the precise spot of  
whose burial is absolutely ascertained.</p>  
<p>The tradition has descended through the family, that  
the body, after having been obtained at the place of  
execution, was strapped by a young grandson on the  
back of a horse, brought home to the farm, and buried  
beneath the shade of his own trees. Two sunken  
and weather-worn stones marked the spot. There the  
remains rested until 1864, when they were exhumed.  
They were enclosed again, and reverently redeposited

in the same place. The skull was in a state of considerable preservation. An examination of the jawbones showed that he was a very old man at the time  
of his death, and had previously lost all his teeth. The  
length of some parts of the skeleton showed that he was  
a very tall man. These circumstances corresponded  
with the evidence, which was that he was tall of stature; so infirm as to walk with two staffs; with long,  
flowing white hair. The only article found, except the  
bones, was a metallic pin, which might have been used  
as a breastpin, or to hold together his aged locks. It  
is an observable fact, that he rests in his own ground  
still. He had lived for a great length of time on that  
spot; and it remains in his family and in his name  
to this day, having come down by direct descent. It is  
a beautiful locality: the land descends with a gradual  
and smooth declivity to the bank of the river. It is  
not much more than a mile from the city of Salem,  
and in full view from the main road.</p>  
<p>John Willard appears to have been an honest and  
amiable person, an industrious farmer, having a comfortable estate, with a wife and three young children.  
He was a grandson of Old Bray Wilkins; whether by  
blood or marriage, I have not been able to ascertain.  
The indications are that he married a daughter of  
Thomas or Henry Wilkins, most probably the former,  
with both of whom he was a joint possessor of lands.  
He came from Groton; and it is for local antiquaries to discover whether he was a relative of the Rev.  
Samuel Willard of Boston. If so, the fact would

<figure entity="Uphv2331">  
<figDesc>Page 322.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
shed much light upon our story. There is but one  
piece of evidence among the papers relating to his  
trial that deserves particular notice. It shows the  
horrid character of the charges made by the girls  
against prisoners at the bar, from their nature incapable of being refuted and which the prisoners knew  
to be false, but the Court, jury, and crowd implicitly  
believed. It also illustrates the completeness of the  
machinery got up by the &ldquo;accusing girls&rdquo; to give  
effect to their evidence. In addition to the evil gossip  
that could be scoured from all the country round,  
and to spectres of witches and ghosts of the dead,  
they brought into the scene angels and divine beings,  
and testified to what they were told by them. &ldquo;The  
shining man,&rdquo; or the white man, was meant, in the following deposition, to be a spirit of this description: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Susanna Sheldon,</hi> aged eighteen  
years or thereabouts. &mdash; Testifieth and saith, that, the day of  
the date hereof (9th of May, 1692), I saw at Nathaniel Ingersoll house the apparitions of these four persons, &mdash; William  
Shaw's first wife, the Widow Cook, Goodman Jones and  
his child; and among these came the apparition of John  
Willard, to whom these four said, `You have murdered us.'  
These four having said thus to Willard, they turned as red  
as blood. And, turning about to look at me, they turned as  
pale as death. These four desired me to tell Mr. Hathorne.  
Willard, hearing them, pulled out a knife, saying, if I did,  
he would cut my throat.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The deponent goes on to say, that these several  
apparitions came before her on another occasion, and  
the same language and actions took place, and adds: &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="323" id="vII323"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2332">  
<figDesc>Page 323.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;There did appear to me a shining man, who said I  
should go and tell what I had heard and seen to Mr.  
Hathorne. This Willard, being there present, told me, if I  
did, he would cut my throat. At this time and place, this  
shining man told me, that if I did go to tell this to Mr.  
Hathorne, that I should be well, going and coming, but I  
should be afflicted there. Then said I to the shining man,  
`Hunt Willard away, and I would believe what he said, that  
he might not choke me.' With that the shining man held  
up his hand, and Willard vanished away. About two hours  
after, the same appeared to me again, and the said Willard  
with them; and I asked them where their wounds were,  
and they said there would come an angel from heaven, and  
would show them. And forthwith the angel came. I  
asked what the man's name was that appeared to me last,  
and the angel told his name was Southwick. And the angel  
lifted up his winding-sheet, and out of his left side he pulled  
a pitchfork tine, and put it in again, and likewise he opened  
all the winding-sheets, and showed all their wounds. And  
the white man told me to tell Mr. Hathorne of it, and I  
told him to hunt Willard away, and I would; and he held  
up his hand, and he vanished away.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>In the same deposition, this girl testifies that &ldquo;she  
saw this Willard suckle the apparitions of two black  
pigs on his breasts;&rdquo; that Willard told her he had  
been a witch twenty years; that she saw Willard  
and other wizards kneel in prayer &ldquo;to the black  
man with a long-crowned hat, and then they vanished  
away.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Such was the kind of testimony which the Court  
received with awe-struck and bewildered credulity,  
<pb n="324" id="vII324"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2333">  
<figDesc>Page 324.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and which took away the lives of valuable and blameless men. All we know of the manner of Willard's  
death is a passage from Brattle, who states that a deep  
impression was produced by the admirable deportment  
of the sufferers during the awful scenes before and at  
their executions; giving every evidence of conscious  
innocence and a Christian character and faith, on the  
part especially of &ldquo;Procter and Willard, whose whole  
management of themselves from the jail to the gallows, and whilst at the gallows, was very affecting, and  
melting to the hearts of some considerable spectators  
whom I could mention to you: but they are executed,  
and so I leave them.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>On the 9th of September, the Court met again; and  
<hi rend="italics">Martha Corey, Mary Easty, Alice Parker, Ann Pudeator,</hi> Dorcas Hoar, and Mary Bradbury were tried and  
condemned; and, on the 17th, <hi rend="italics">Margaret Scott, Wilmot

and at the time of their execution, but little information has reached us. The following extract from  
Mr. Parris's church-records presents a striking picture: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;11 September, Lord's Day. &mdash; Sister Martha Corey &mdash;  
taken into the church 27 April, 1690 &mdash; was, after examination upon suspicion of witchcraft, 27 March, 1692, committed to prison for that fact, and was condemned to the

gallows for the same yesterday; and was this day in public,  
by a general consent, voted to be excommunicated out of the  
church, and Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam and the two deacons chosen to signify to her, with the pastor, the mind of  
the church herein. Accordingly, this 14 September, 1692,  
the three aforesaid brethren went with the pastor to her in  
Salem Prison; whom we found very obdurate, justifying  
herself, and condemning all that had done any thing to her  
just discovery or condemnation. Whereupon, after a little  
discourse (for her imperiousness would not suffer much),  
and after prayer, &mdash; which she was willing to decline, &mdash;  
the dreadful sentence of excommunication was pronounced  
against her.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Calef informs us, that &ldquo;Martha Corey, protesting  
her innocency, concluded her life with an eminent  
prayer upon the ladder.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Nothing has reached us particularly relating to the  
manner of death of Alice or Mary Parker, Ann Pudeator, Margaret Scott, or Wilmot Reed. They all asserted their innocence; and their deportment gave no  
ground for any unfavorable comment by their persecutors, who were on the watch to turn every act, word,  
or look of the sufferers to their disparagement. Wilmot Reed probably adhered to the unresisting demeanor which marked her examination. It was all a  
mystery to her; and to every question she answered,  
&ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo; Of Mary Easty it is  
grateful to have some account. Her own declarations  
in vindication of her innocence are fortunately preserved; and her noble record is complete in the following

documents. The first appears to have been  
addressed to the Special Court, and was presented  
immediately before the trial of Mary Easty. No explanation has come down to us why Sarah Cloyse was  
not then also brought to trial. Circumstances to  
which we have no clew rescued her from the fate of  
her sisters.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble Request of Mary Easty and Sarah Cloyse

something which we hope may be looked upon as very considerable in this matter, with the seven children of one of  
us; viz., Mary Easty: and it may be produced of like nature in reference to the wife of Peter Cloyse, her sister.  
Thirdly, that the testimony of witches, or such as are afflicted as is supposed by witches, may not be improved to

<figDesc>Page 327.</figDesc>

condemn us without other legal evidence concurring. We  
hope the honored Court and jury will be so tender of the  
lives of such as we are, who have for many years lived  
under the unblemished reputation of Christianity, as not to  
condemn them without a fair and equal hearing of what  
may be said for us as well as against us. And your poor  
suppliants shall be bound always to pray, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The following was presented by Mary Easty to the  
judges after she had received sentence of death. It  
would be hard to find, in all the records of human suffering and of Christian deportment under them, a  
more affecting production. It is a most beautiful  
specimen of strong good-sense, pious fortitude and  
faith, genuine dignity of soul, noble benevolence, and  
the true eloquence of a pure heart; and was evidently  
composed by her own hand. It may be said of her &mdash;  
and there can be no higher eulogium &mdash; that she felt  
for others more than for herself.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble Petition of Mary Easty unto his Excellency Sir William Phips, and to the Honored Judge and  
Bench now sitting in Judicature in Salem, and the Reverend  
Ministers, humbly showeth,</hi> that, whereas your poor and  
humble petitioner, being condemned to die, do humbly beg  
of you to take it in your judicious and pious consideration,  
that your poor and humble petitioner, knowing my own  
innocency, blessed be the Lord for it! and seeing plainly the  
wiles and subtilty of my accusers by myself, cannot but  
judge charitably of others that are going the same way of  
myself, if the Lord steps not mightily in. I was confined a  
whole month upon the same account that I am condemned  
<pb n="328" id="vII328"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2337">  
<figDesc>Page 328.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
now for, and then cleared by the afflicted persons, as some  
of Your Honors know. And in two days' time I was cried  
out upon them, and have been confined, and now am condemned to die. The Lord above knows my innocency then,  
and likewise does now, as at the great day will be known  
to men and angels. I petition to Your Honors not for my  
own life, for I know I must die, and my appointed time is  
set; but the Lord he knows it is that, if it be possible, no  
more innocent blood may be shed, which undoubtedly cannot  
be avoided in the way and course you go in. I question  
not but Your Honors do to the utmost of your powers in the  
discovery and detecting of witchcraft and witches, and would  
not be guilty of innocent blood for the world. But, by my  
own innocency, I know you are in the wrong way. The  
Lord in his infinite mercy direct you in this great work, if  
it be his blessed will that no more innocent blood be shed!  
I would humbly beg of you, that Your Honors would be  
pleased to examine these afflicted persons strictly, and keep  
them apart some time, and likewise to try some of these  
confessing witches; I being confident there is several of them  
has belied themselves and others, as will appear, if not in  
this world, I am sure in the world to come, whither I am now  
agoing. I question not but you will see an alteration of these  
things. They say myself and others having made a league  
with the Devil, we cannot confess. I know, and the Lord  
knows, as will... appear, they belie me, and so I question  
not but they do others. The Lord above, who is the Searcher  
of all hearts, knows, as I shall answer it at the tribunal  
seat, that I know not the least thing of witchcraft; therefore  
I cannot, I dare not, belie my own soul. I beg Your Honors  
not to deny this my humble petition from a poor, dying,  
innocent person. And I question not but the Lord will give  
a blessing to your endeavors.&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>The parting interview of this admirable woman with  
her husband, children, and friends, as she was about  
proceeding to the place of execution, is said to have  
been a most solemn, affecting, and truly sublime scene.  
Calef says that her farewell communications, on this  
occasion, were reported, by persons who listened to  
them, to have been &ldquo;as serious, religious, distinct,  
and affectionate as could well be expressed, drawing  
tears from the eyes of almost all present.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Ann Pudeator had been formerly the wife of a person named Greenslitt, who left her with five children.  
Her subsequent husband, Jacob Pudeator, died in  
1682, and by will gave her his whole estate, after the  
payment of legacies, of five pounds each, to her Greenslitt children, who appear to have been living in 1692  
at Casco Bay. These provisions, as well as the expressions used by Pudeator, indicate that he regarded  
her with affection and esteem. The following document is all that we know else of her character particularly, except that she was a kind neighbor, and ever  
prompt in offices of charity and sympathy.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble Petition of Ann Pudeator unto the Honored  
Judge and Bench now sitting in Judicature in Salem, humbly  
showeth,</hi> that, whereas your poor and humble petitioner,  
being condemned to die, and knowing in my own conscience,  
as I shall shortly answer it before the great God of heaven,  
who is the Searcher and Knower of all hearts, that the evidence of Jno. Best, Sr., and Jno. Best, Jr., and Samuel  
Pickworth, which was given in against me in Court, were  
all of them altogether false and untrue, and, besides the

Honors to take it into your judicious and pious consideration, that my life may not be taken away by such false  
evidences and witnesses as these be; likewise, the evidence  
given in against me by Sarah Churchill and Mary Warren  
I am altogether ignorant of, and know nothing in the least  
measure about it, nor nothing else concerning the crime  
of witchcraft, for which I am condemned to die, as will be  
known to men and angels at the great day of judgment.  
Begging and imploring your prayers at the Throne of Grace

ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for Your Honors' health  
and happiness in this life, and eternal felicity in the world

<p>Abigail, the wife of Francis Faulkner, and daughter  
of the Rev. Francis Dane, of Andover, who was among  
those sentenced on the 17th of September, had been  
examined, on the 11th of August, by Hathorne, Corwin, and Captain John Higginson, sitting as magistrates. Upon the prisoner's being brought in, the  
afflicted fell down, and went into fits, as usual. The  
magistrates asked the prisoner what she had to say.  
She replied, &ldquo;I know nothing of it.&rdquo; The girls then  
renewed their performances, declaring that her shape  
was at that moment torturing them. The magistrates  
asked her if she did not see their sufferings. She  
answered, &ldquo;Yes; but it is the Devil does it in my  
shape.&rdquo; Ann Putnam said that her spectre had afflicted her a few days before, pulling her off her horse.  
<pb n="331" id="vII331"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2340">  
<figDesc>Page 331.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Upon the touch of her person, the sufferings of the  
afflicted would cease for a time. The prisoner held  
a handkerchief in her hand. The girls would screech  
out, declaring that, as she pressed the handkerchief,  
they were dreadfully squeezed. She threw the handkerchief on the table; and they said, &ldquo;There are the  
shapes of Daniel Eames and Captain Floyd [two persons then in prison on the charge of witchcraft] sitting  
on her handkerchief.&rdquo; Mary Warren enacted the part  
of being dragged against her will under the table by  
an invisible hand, from whose grasp she was at once  
released, upon the prisoner's being made to touch her.  
Notwithstanding all this, she protested her innocence,  
and was remanded to jail. On the 30th, she was  
brought out again. In the mean while, six had been  
executed. The usual means were employed to break  
her down; but all that was gained was, that she  
owned she had expressed her indignation at the conduct of the afflicted, and was much excited against  
them &ldquo;for bringing her kindred out, and she did  
wish them ill: and, her spirit being raised, she did  
pinch her hands together, and she knew not but  
that the Devil might take that advantage; but it  
was the Devil, and not she, that afflicted them.&rdquo;  
This was the only concession she would make; and  
they were puzzled to determine whether it was a confession, or not, &mdash; it having rather the appearance of  
clearing herself from all implication with the Devil,  
and leaving him on their hands &mdash; at any rate, they concluded to regard it in the latter sense; and she was  
<pb n="332" id="vII332"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2341">  
<figDesc>Page 332.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
duly convicted, and sentenced to death. Sir William  
Phips ordered a reprieve; and, after she had been  
thirteen weeks in prison, he directed her to be discharged on the ground of insufficient evidence. This,  
I think, is the only instance of a special pardon granted  
during the proceedings.</p>  
<p>Samuel Wardwell, like most of the accused belonging to Andover, had originally joined the crowd of  
the confessors; but he was too much of a man to remain in that company. He took back his confession,  
and met his death. While he was speaking to the  
people, at the gallows, declaring his innocency, a puff  
of tobacco-smoke from the pipe of the executioner,  
as Calef informs us, &ldquo;coming in his face, interrupted  
his discourse: those accusers said that the Devil did  
hinder him with smoke.&rdquo; The wicked creatures followed their victims to the last with their malignant  
outrages. The cart that carried the prisoners, on this  
occasion, to the hill, &ldquo;was for some time at a set:  
the afflicted and others said that the Devil hindered  
it,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>  
<p>The route by which they were conveyed from the  
jail, which was at the north corner of Federal and  
St. Peter's Streets, to the gallows, must have been  
a cruelly painful and fatiguing one, particularly to infirm and delicate persons, as many of them were. It  
was through St. Peter's, up the whole length of Essex,  
and thence probably along Boston Street, far towards  
Aborn Street; for the hill could only be ascended from  
that direction. It must have been a rough and jolting  
<pb n="333" id="vII333"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2342">  
<figDesc>Page 333.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
operation; and it is not strange that the cart got  
&ldquo;set.&rdquo; It seems that the prisoners were carried in  
a single cart. It was a large one, provided probably  
for the occasion; and it is not unlikely that the reason  
why some who had been condemned were not executed, was that the cart could not hold them all at  
once. They were executed, one in June, five in July,  
five in August, and eight in September, with the intention, no doubt, by taking them in instalments, to  
extend the acts of the tragedy, from month to month,  
indefinitely.</p>  
<p>It was necessary for the safety of the accusers and  
prosecutors to prevent a revulsion of the public mind,  
or even the least diminution of the popular violence  
against the supposed witches. As they all protested  
their innocence to the moment of death, and exhibited  
a remarkably Christian deportment throughout the  
dreadful scenes they were called to encounter from  
their arrest to their execution, there was reason to  
apprehend that the people would gradually be led to  
feel a sympathy for them, if not to entertain doubts of  
their guilt. To prevent this, and remove any impressions favorable to them that might be made by the  
conduct and declarations of the convicts, the prosecutors were on the alert. After the prisoners had been  
swung off, on the 22d of September, &ldquo;turning him to  
the bodies, Mr. Noyes said, `What a sad thing it is  
to see eight firebrands of hell hanging there!&rdquo;' It  
was the last time his eyes were regaled by such a  
sight. There were no more executions on Witch Hill.</p>

<p>Three days before, a life had been taken by the  
officers of the law in a manner so extraordinary, and  
marked by features so shocking, that they find no parallel in the annals of America, and will continue to  
arrest for ever the notice of mankind. The history  
and character of old Giles Corey have been given in  
preceding parts of this work. The only papers relating to him, on file as having been sworn to before the  
Grand Jury, are a few brief depositions. If he had  
been put on trial, we might have had more. Elizabeth  
Woodwell testifies, that &ldquo;she saw Giles Corey at meeting at Salem on a lecture-day, since he has been in  
prison. He or his apparition came in, and sat in the  
middlemost seat of the men's seats, by the post. This  
was the lecture-day before Bridget Bishop was hanged.  
And I saw him come out with the rest of the people.&rdquo;  
Mary Walcot, of course, swore to the same. And  
Mary Warren swore that Corey was hostile to her  
and afflicted her, because he thought she &ldquo;caused her  
master (John Procter) to ask more for a piece of  
meadow than he (Corey) was willing to give.&rdquo; She  
also charged him with &ldquo;afflicting of her&rdquo; by his spectre while he was in prison, and &ldquo;described him in all  
his garments, both fo hat, coat, and the color of them,  
&mdash; with a cord about his waist and a white cap on his  
head, and in chains.&rdquo; There is reason to believe,  
that, while in prison, he experienced great distress of  
mind. Although he had been a rough character in  
earlier life, and given occasion to much scandal by his  
disregard of public opinion, he always exhibited symptoms  
<pb n="335" id="vII335"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2344">  
<figDesc>Page 335.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of a generous and sensitive nature. His foolish  
conduct in becoming so passionately engaged in the  
witchcraft proceedings, at their earliest stage, as to be  
incensed against his wife because she did not approve  
of or believe in them, and which led him to utter sentiments and expressions that had been used against  
her; and so far yielding to the accusers as to allow  
them to get from him the deposition, which, while it  
failed to satisfy their demands, it was shameful for  
him to have been persuaded to give, &mdash; all these things,  
which after his own apprehension and imprisonment he  
had leisure to ponder upon, preyed on his mind. He  
saw the awful character of the delusion to which he  
had lent himself; that it had brought his prayerful  
and excellent wife to the sentence of death, which had  
already been executed upon many other devout and  
worthy persons. He knew that he was innocent of the  
crime of witchcraft, and was now satisfied that all  
others were. Besides his own unfriendly course towards his wife, two of his four sons-in-law had turned  
against her. One (Crosby) had testified, and another  
(Parker) had allowed his name to be used, as an adverse witness. In view of all this, Corey made up his  
mind, determined on his course, and stood to that  
determination. He resolved to expiate his own folly  
by a fate that would satisfy the demands of the sternest criticism upon his conduct; proclaim his abhorrence of the prosecutions; and attest the strength of  
his feelings towards those of his children who had  
been false, and those who had been true, to his wife.  
<pb n="336" id="vII336"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2345">  
<figDesc>Page 336.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
He caused to be drawn up what has been called a will,  
although it is in reality a deed, and was duly recorded  
as such. Its phraseology is very strongly guarded,  
and made to give it clear, full, and certain effect. It  
begins thus: &ldquo;Know ye, &amp;c., that I, Giles Corey, lying  
under great trouble and affliction, through which I am  
very weak in body, but in perfect memory, &mdash; knowing  
not how soon I may depart this life; in consideration  
of which, and for the fatherly love and affection which  
I have and do bear unto my beloved son-in-law, William Cleeves, of the town of Beverly, and to my son, John Moulton, of the town of Salem, as also for  
divers other good causes and considerations me at the  
present especially moving;&rdquo; and proceeds to convey  
and confirm all his property &mdash; &ldquo;lands, meadow, housing, cattle, stock, movables and immovables, money,  
apparel,... and all other the aforesaid premises,  
with their appurtenances&rdquo; &mdash; to the said Cleeves and  
Moulton &ldquo;for ever, freely and quietly, without any  
manner of challenge, claim, or demand of me the said  
Giles Corey, or of any other person or persons whatsoever for me in my name, or by my cause, means, or  
procurement;&rdquo; and, in the use of all the language  
applicable to that end, he warrants and binds himself to defend the aforesaid conveyance and grant to  
Cleeves and Moulton, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns for ever. The document was  
properly signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence  
of competent witnesses, whose several signatures are  
indorsed to that effect. It was duly acknowledged  
<pb n="337" id="vII337"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2346">  
<figDesc>Page 337.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
before &ldquo;Thomas Wade, Justice of the Peace in Essex,&rdquo;  
and recorded forthwith. This transaction took place  
in the jail at Ipswich.</p>  
<p>His whole property being thus securely conveyed to  
his faithful sons-in-law, and placed beyond the reach  
of his own weakness or change of purpose, Corey resolved on a course that would surely try to the utmost  
the power of human endurance and firmness. He  
knew, that, if brought to trial, his death was certain.  
He did not know but that conviction and execution,  
through the attainder connected with it, might invalidate all attempts of his to convey his property. But  
it was certain, that, if he should not be brought to trial  
and conviction, his deed would stand, and nothing  
could break it, or defeat its effect. He accordingly  
made up his mind not to be tried. When called into  
court to answer to the indictment found by the Grand  
Jury, he did not plead &ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; but  
stood mute. How often he was called forth, we are  
not informed; but nothing could shake him. No  
power on earth could unseal his lips.</p>  
<p>He knew that he could have no trial that would  
deserve the name. To have pleaded &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo;  
would have made him, by his own act, a party to the  
proceeding, and have been, by implication, an assent  
to putting his case to the decision of a blind, maddened, and utterly perverted tribunal. He would not,  
by any act or utterance of his, leave his case with  
&ldquo;the country&rdquo; represented by a jury that embodied  
the passions of the deluded and infatuated multitude  
<pb n="338" id="vII338"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2347">  
<figDesc>Page 338.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
around him. He knew that the gates of justice were  
closed, and that truth had fled from the scene. He  
would have no part nor lot in the matter; refused to  
recognize the court, made no response to its questions,  
and was dumb in its presence. He stands alone in  
the resolute defiance of his attitude. He knew the  
penalty of suffering and agony he would have to pay;  
but he freely and fearlessly encountered it. All that  
was needed to carry his point was an unconquerable  
firmness, and he had it. He rendered it impossible to  
bring him to trial; and thereby, in spite of the power  
and wrath of the whole country and its authorities,  
retained his right to dispose of his property; and bore  
his testimony against the wickedness and folly of the  
hour in tones that reached the whole world, and will  
resound through all the ages.</p>  
<p>When Corey took this ground, the Court found itself  
in a position of no little difficulty, and was probably at  
a loss what to do. No information has come to us  
of the details of the proceedings. If the usages in  
England on such occasions were adopted, the prisoner  
was three times brought before the Court, and called  
to plead; the consequences of persisting in standing  
mute being solemnly announced to him at each time.  
If he remained obdurate, the sentence of <foreign lang="unknown" rend="italics">peine forte  
et dure</foreign> was passed upon him; and, remanded to  
prison, he was put into a low and dark apartment.  
He would there be laid on his back on the bare floor,  
naked for the most part. A weight of iron would be  
placed upon him, not quite enough to crush him. He  
<pb n="339" id="vII339"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2348">  
<figDesc>Page 339.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
would have no sustenance, save only, on the first day,  
three morsels of the worst bread; and, on the second  
day, three draughts of standing water that should be  
nearest to the prison door: and, in this situation, such  
would be alternately his daily diet till he died, or till  
he answered. The object of this terrible punishment  
was to induce the prisoner to plead to the indictment;  
upon doing which, he would be brought to trial in the  
ordinary way. The motive that led prisoners to stand  
mute in England is stated to have been, most generally, to save their property from confiscation. The  
practice of putting weights upon them, and gradually  
increasing them, was to force them, by the slowly increasing torture, to yield.</p>  
<p>How far the English practice was imitated in the  
case of Corey will remain for ever among the dread  
secrets of his prison-house. The tradition is, that the  
last act in the tragedy was in an open field near the  
jail, somewhere between Howard-street Burial Ground  
and Brown Street. It is said that Corey urged the executioners to increase the weight which was crushing  
him, that he told them it was of no use to expect him  
to yield, that there could be but one way of ending  
the matter, and that they might as well pile on the  
rocks. Calef says, that, as his body yielded to the  
pressure, his tongue protruded from his mouth, and  
an official forced it back with his cane. Some persons  
now living remember a popular superstition, lingering  
in the minds of some of the more ignorant class, that  
Corey's ghost haunted the grounds where this barbarous  
<pb n="340" id="vII340"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2349">  
<figDesc>Page 340.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
deed was done; and that boys, as they sported in  
the vicinity, were in the habit of singing a ditty beginning thus: &mdash;</p>  
<q><lg type="verse">  
<l>&ldquo;`More weight! more weight!'</l>  
<l>Giles Corey he cried.&rdquo;</l>  
</lg></q>  
<p>For a person of more than eighty-one years of age,  
this must be allowed to have been a marvellous exhibition of prowess; illustrating, as strongly as any  
thing in human history, the power of a resolute will  
over the utmost pain and agony of body, and demonstrating that Giles Corey was a man of heroic nerve,  
and of a spirit that could not be subdued.</p>  
<p>It produced a deep effect, as it was feared that it  
would. The bearing of all the sufferers at all the  
stages of the proceedings, and at their execution, had  
told in their favor; but the course of Giles Corey profoundly affected the public mind. This must have  
been noticed by the managers of the prosecutions; and  
they felt that some extraordinary expedient was necessary to renew, and render more intense than ever, the  
general infatuation. From the very beginning, there  
had been great skill and adroitness in arranging the  
order of incidents, and supplying the requisite excitements at the right moments and the right points.  
Some persons &mdash; it can only be conjectured who &mdash;  
had, all along, been behind the scenes, giving direction  
and materials to the open actors. This unseen power  
was in the village; and the movements it devised  
generally proceeded from Thomas Putnam's house, or  
the parsonage. It was on hand to meet the contingency  
<pb n="341" id="vII341"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2350">  
<figDesc>Page 341.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
created by Corey's having actually carried out to the  
last his resolution to meet a form of death that would,  
if any thing could, cause a re-action in the public mind;  
and the following <unclear></unclear> was contrived to turn the  
manner of his death into the means of more than ever  
blinding and infatuating the people. It was the last  
and one of the most artful strokes of policy by the  
prosecutors. On the day after the death of Corey, and  
two days before the execution of his wife, Mary Easty,  
and the six others, Judge Sewall, then in Salem, received a letter from Thomas Putnam to this effect: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Last night, my daughter Ann was grievously tormented  
by witches, threatening that she should be pressed to death  
before Giles Corey; but, through the goodness of a gracious  
God, she had at last a little respite. Whereupon there  
appeared unto her (she said) a man in a winding-sheet,  
who told her that Giles Corey had murdered him by pressing  
him to death with his feet; but that the Devil there appeared unto him, and covenanted with him, and promised  
him that he should not be hanged. The apparition said God  
hardened his heart, that he should not hearken to the advice  
of the Court, and so die an easy death; because, as it said,  
it must be done to him as he has done to me. The apparition also said that Giles Corey was carried to the Court for  
this, and that the jury had found the murder; and that her  
father knew the man, and the thing was done before she  
was born.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Cotton Mather represented this vision, made to Ann  
Putnam, as proof positive of a divine communication  
to her, because, as he says, she could not have received  
<pb n="342" id="vII342"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2351">  
<figDesc>Page 342.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
her information from a human source, as everybody  
had forgotten the affair long ago; and that she never  
could have heard of it, happening, as it did, before she  
was born. Bringing up this old matter to meet the effect  
produced by Corey's death was indeed a skilful move;  
and it answered its purpose probably to a considerable  
extent. The man whom Corey was thus charged with  
having murdered seventeen years before died in a manner causing some gossip at the time; and a coroner's  
jury found that he had been &ldquo;bruised to death, having  
clodders of blood about the heart.&rdquo; Bringing the  
affair back to the public mind, with the story of Ann  
Putnam's vision, was well calculated to meet and  
check any sympathy that might threaten to arise in  
favor of Corey. But the trick, however ingenious,  
will not stand the test of scrutiny. Mather's statement that everybody had forgotten the transaction,  
and that Ann could only have known of it supernaturally, is wholly untenable; for it was precisely  
one of those things that are never forgotten in a  
country village: it had always been kept alive as a  
part of the gossip of the neighborhood in connection  
with Corey; and her own father, as is unwittingly  
acknowledged, knew the man, and all about it. Of  
course, the girl had heard of it from him and others.  
The industry that had ransacked the traditions and  
collected the scandal of the whole country, far and  
near, for stories that were brought in evidence against  
all the prisoners, had not failed to pick up this choice  
bit against Corey. The only reason why it had not  
<pb n="343" id="vII343"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2352">  
<figDesc>Page 343.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
before been brought out was because he had not been  
on trial. The man who died with &ldquo;clodders of blood  
about his heart,&rdquo; seventeen years before, was an unfortunate and worthless person, who had incurred  
punishment for his misconduct while a servant on  
Corey's farm, and afterwards at the hands of his own  
family: and he does not appear to have mended his  
morals upon passing into the spiritual world; for the  
statement of his ghost to Ann Putnam, that the jury  
had found Corey guilty of murder, and that the  
Court was hindered by some enchantment from proceeding against him, is disproved by the record which  
is &mdash; as has been mentioned in the First Part, vol. i.  
p. 185 &mdash; that the man was carried back to his house  
by Corey's wife, and died there some time after; and  
the Court did no more than fine Corey for the punishment he had inflicted upon him while in his service,  
and which the evidence showed was repeated by his  
parents after his return to his own family.</p>  
<p>Thomas Putnam's letter and Ann's vision were the  
last things of the kind that occurred. The delusion  
was approaching its close, and the people were beginning to be restored to their senses.</p>  
<p>When it became known that Corey's resolution was  
likely to hold out, and that no torments or cruelties of  
any kind could subdue his firm and invincible spirit,  
Mr. Noyes hurried a special meeting of his church on  
a week-day, and had the satisfaction of dealing the  
same awful doom upon him as upon Rebecca Nurse.  
The entry in the record of the First Church is as  
follows: &mdash;</p>  
<pb n="344" id="vII344"/>

<figure entity="Uphv2353">  
<figDesc>Page 344.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Sept. 18, G. Corey was excommunicated: the cause  
of it was, that he being accused and indicted for the sin of  
witchcraft, he refused to plead, and so incurred the sentence and penalty of <hi rend="italics">pain fort dure;</hi> being undoubtedly  
either guilty of the sin of witchcraft, or of throwing himself  
upon sudden and certain death, if he were otherwise innocent.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This attempt to introduce a form of argument into  
a church act of excommunication is a slight but  
significant symptom of its having become felt that the  
breath of reason had begun to raise a ripple upon  
the surface of the public mind. It increased slowly  
but steadily to a gale that beat with severity upon Mr.  
Noyes and all his fellow-persecutors to their dying day.</p>  
<p>After the executions, on the 22d of September, the  
Court adjourned to meet some weeks subsequently;  
and it was, no doubt, their expectation to continue  
from month to month to hold sessions, and supply,  
each time, new cart-loads of victims to the hangman.  
But a sudden collapse took place in the machinery,  
and they met no more. The executive authority intervened, and their functions ceased. The curtain fell unexpectedly, and the tragedy ended. It is not known precisely what caused this sudden change. It is probable,  
that a revolution had been going on some time in the  
public mind, which was kept for a while from notice,  
but at last became too apparent and too serious to be  
disregarded. It has generally been attributed to the  
fact, that the girls became over-confident, and struck  
too high. They had ventured, as we have seen, to cry  
<pb n="345" id="vII345"/>

<figDesc>Page 345.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
out against the Rev. Samuel Willard, but were rebuked and silenced by the Court. Whoever began to  
waver in his confidence of the correctness of the proceedings was in danger of being attacked by them;  
and, as a general thing, when a person was &ldquo;cried out  
upon,&rdquo; it may be taken as proof that he had spoken  
against them. Increase Mather, the president of Harvard College, called by Eliot &ldquo;the father of New clergy,&rdquo; was understood not to go so far as  
his son Cotton in sustaining the proceedings; and a  
member of his family was accused. The wife of Sir  
William Phips sympathized with those who suffered  
prosecution, and is said to have written an order for  
the release of a prisoner from jail. She was cried out  
upon. It may have been noticed, that, though Jonathan Corwin sat with Hathorne as an examining  
magistrate and assistant, and signed the commitments  
of the prisoners, he never took an active part, but was  
a silent and passive agent in the scene. He was subsequently raised to the bench; but there is reason  
to believe that his mind was not clear as to the correctness of the proceedings. This probably became  
known to the accusing girls; for they cried out repeatedly against his wife's <unclear></unclear> her, a respectable and  
venerable lady in Boston. The accusers, in aiming  
at such characters, overestimated their power; and  
the tide began to turn against them. But what  
finally broke the spell by which they had hold the  
minds of the whole colony in bondage was their  
accusation, in October, of Mrs. Hale, the wife of the  
<pb n="346" id="vII346"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2355">  
<figDesc>Page 346.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
minister of the First Church in Beverly. Her genuine  
and distinguished virtues had won for her a reputation,  
and secured in the hearts of the people a confidence,  
which superstition itself could not sully nor shake.  
Mr. Hale had been active in all the previous proceedings; but he knew the innocence and piety of his wife,  
and he stood forth between her and the storm he had  
helped to raise: although he had driven it on while  
others were its victims, he turned and resisted it when  
it burst in upon his own dwelling. The whole community became convinced that the accusers in crying  
out upon Mrs. Hale, had perjured themselves, and  
from that moment their power was destroyed; the  
awful delusion was dispelled, and a close put to one of  
the most tremendous tragedies in the history of real  
life. The wildest storm, perhaps, that ever raged in  
the moral world, became a calm; the tide that had  
threatened to overwhelm every thing in its fury, sunk  
back to its peaceful bed. There are few, if any, other  
instances in history, of a revolution of opinion and  
feeling so sudden, so rapid, and so complete. The  
images and visions that had possessed the bewildered  
imaginations of the people flitted away, and left them  
standing in the sunshine of reason and their senses;  
and they could have exclaimed, as they witnessed them  
passing off, in the language of the great master of the  
drama and of human nature, but that their rigid  
Puritan principles would not, it is presumed, have  
permitted them, even in that moment of rescue and  
deliverance, to quote Shakspeare, &mdash;</p>

<l>As breath into the wind.&rdquo;</l>  
</lg></q>  
<p>Sir William Phips well knew that the public sentiment demanded a stop to be put to the prosecutions.  
Besides that many of the people had lost all faith in  
the grounds on which they had been conducted, an  
influence from the higher orders of society began to  
make itself felt. Hutchinson says, &ldquo;Although many  
such had suffered, yet there remained in prison a  
number of women of as reputable families as any in  
the towns where they lived, and several persons, of  
still superior rank, were hinted at by the pretended  
bewitched, or by the confessing witches. Some had  
been publicly named. Dudley Bradstreet, a justice  
of peace, who had been appointed one of President  
Dudley's council, and who was son to the worthy old  
governor, then living, found it necessary to abscond.  
Having been remiss in prosecuting, he had been charged  
by some of the afflicted as a confederate. His brother,  
John Bradstreet, was forced to fly also.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The termination of the proceedings was probably  
effectually secured by the spirited course of certain  
parties in Andover, who, at the first moment of its  
appearing that the public sentiment was changing,  
commenced actions for slander against the accusers.</p>  
<p>The result of the whole matter was, that, while some  
of the judges, magistrates, and ministers persisted in  
their fanatical zeal, the great body of the people, high  
and low, were rescued from the delusion.</p>

</p>  
<p>While, in the course of our story, we have witnessed  
some shocking instances of the violation of the most  
sacred affections and obligations of life, in husbands  
and wives, parents and children, testifying against  
each other, and exerting themselves for mutual destruction, we must not overlook the many instances  
in which filial, parental, and fraternal fidelity and love  
have shone conspicuously. It was dangerous to befriend an accused person. Procter stood by his wife  
to protect her, and it cost him his life. Children  
protested against the treatment of their parents, and  
they were all thrown into prison. Daniel Andrew,  
a citizen of high standing, who had been deputy to  
the General Court, asserted, in the boldest language,  
his belief of Rebecca Nurse's innocence; and he had  
to fly the country to save his life. Many devoted  
sons and daughters clung to their parents, visited  
them in prison in defiance of a bloodthirsty mob;  
kept by their side on the way to execution; expressed  
their love, sympathy, and reverence to the last; and,  
by brave and perilous enterprise, got possession of  
their remains, and bore them back under the cover  
of midnight to their own thresholds, and to graves  
kept consecrated by their prayers and tears. One  
noble young man is said to have effected his mother's  
escape from the jail, and secreted her in the woods  
until after the delusion had passed away, provided food  
and clothing for her, erected a wigwam for her shelter, and surrounded her with every comfort her situation would admit of. The poor creature must,  
<pb n="349" id="vII349"/>

<figDesc>Page 349.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
however, have endured a great amount of suffering;  
for one of her larger limbs was fractured in the all  
but desperate attempt to rescue her from the prison.</p>  
<p>The Special Court being no longer suffered to meet,  
a permanent and regular tribunal, called the Superior  
Court of Judicature, was established, consisting of the  
Deputy-governor, William Stoughton, Chief-justice; and  
Thomas Danforth, John Richards, Wait Winthrop,  
and Samuel Sewall, associate justices. They held a  
Court at Salem, in January, 1693. Hutchinson says  
that, on this occasion, the Grand Jury found about  
fifty indictments. The following persons were brought  
to trial: Rebecca Jacobs, Margaret Jacobs, Sarah Buckley, Job Tookey, Hannah Tyler, Candy, Mary Marston,  
Elizabeth Johnson, Abigail Barker, Mary Tyler, Sarah  
Hawkes, Mary Wardwell, Mary Bridges, Hannah Post,  
Sarah Bridges, Mary Osgood, Mary Lacy, Jr., Sarah  
Wardwell, Elizabeth Johnson, Jr., and Mary Post.  
The three last were condemned, but not executed: all  
the rest were acquitted. Considering that the &ldquo;spectral evidence&rdquo; was wholly thrown out at these trials,  
the facts that the grand jury, under the advice of the  
Court, brought in so many indictments, and that three  
were actually convicted, are as discreditable to the  
regular Court as the convictions at the Special Court  
are to that body. It has been said that the Special  
Court had not an adequate representation of lawyers  
in its composition; and the results of its proceedings  
have been ascribed to that circumstance. It has been  
<pb n="350" id="vII350"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2359">  
<figDesc>Page 350.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
held up disparagingly in comparison with the regular Court that succeeded it. But, in fact, the regular  
Court consisted of persons all of whom sat in the  
Special Court, with the exception of Danforth. But  
his proceedings in originating the arrests for witchcraft in the fall of 1691, and his action when presiding at the preliminary examination of John Procter,  
Elizabeth Procter, and Sarah Cloyse, at Salem, April  
11, 1692, show that, so far as the permission of gross  
irregularities and the admission of absurd kinds of  
testimony are concerned, the regular Court gained  
nothing by his sitting with it, unless his views had  
been thoroughly changed in the mean time. The truth  
is, that the judges, magistrates, and legislature were  
as much to blame, in this whole business, as the  
ministers, and much more slow to come to their senses,  
and make amends for their wrong-doing.</p>  
<p>All the facts known to us, and all the statements  
that have come down to us, require us to believe, that  
none who confessed, and stood to their confession,  
were brought to trial. All who were condemned either  
maintained their innocence from the first, or, if persuaded or overcome into a confession, voluntarily took  
it back and disowned it before trial. If this be so,  
then the name of every person condemned ought to  
be held in lasting honor, as preferring to die rather  
than lie, or stand to a lie. It required great strength  
of mind to take back a confession; relinquish life and  
liberty; go down into a dungeon, loaded with irons;  
and from thence to ascend the gallows. It relieves  
<pb n="351" id="vII351"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2360">  
<figDesc>Page 351.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the mind to think, that Abigail Hobbs, wicked and  
shocking as her conduct had been towards Mr. Burroughs and others, came to herself, and offered her  
life in atonement for her sin.</p>  
<p>The Court continued the trials at successive sessions  
during the spring, all resulting in acquittals, until in  
May, 1693, Sir William Phips, by proclamation, discharged all. Hutchinson says, &ldquo;Such a jail-delivery  
has never been known in New England.&rdquo; The number then released is stated to have been one hundred  
and fifty. How many had been apprehended, during  
the whole affair, we have no means of knowing.  
Twenty, counting Giles Corey, had been executed.  
Two at least, Ann Foster and Sarah Osburn, had died  
in jail: it is not improbable that others perished  
under the bodily and mental sufferings there. We  
find frequent expressions indicating that many died  
in prison. A considerable number of children, and  
some adults whose friends were able to give the heavy  
bonds required and had influence enough to secure  
the favor, had some time before been removed to  
private custody. Quite a considerable number had  
succeeded in breaking jail and eluding recapture.  
Upon the whole, there must have been several hundreds committed. Even after acquittal by a jury, and  
the Governor's proclamation, none were set at liberty  
until they had paid all charges; including board for  
the whole time of their imprisonment, jailer's fees,  
and fees of Court of all kinds. The families of many  
had become utterly impoverished.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the prisoners and of their relatives and connections are perhaps best illustrated  
by presenting the substance of a few of the petitions  
for their release, found among the files. The friends of  
the parties, in these cases, were not in a condition to  
give the bonds, and they probably remained in jail  
until the general discharge; and how long after, before the means could be raised to pay all dues, we  
cannot know.<note target="v2n4">*</note></p>

<p>Margaret Jacobs had to remain in jail after the  
Governor's proclamation had directed the release of  
all prisoners, because she could not pay the fees and  
charges. Her grandfather had been executed, and  
all his furniture, stock, and moveable property seized  
by the marshal or sheriff. Her father escaped the  
warrant by a sudden flight from his home under  
the cover of midnight, and was in exile &ldquo;beyond the  
seas;&rdquo; her mother and herself taken at the time by  
the officers serving the warrants against them; the  
younger children of the family, left without protection,  
had dispersed, and been thrown upon the charity of  
neighbors; the house had been stripped of its contents,  
left open, and deserted. She had not a shilling in  
the world, and knew not where to look for aid. She  
<pb n="354" id="vII354"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2367">  
<figDesc>Page 354.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
was taken back to prison, and remained there for some  
time, until a person named Gammon, apparently a  
stranger, happened to hear of her case, and, touched  
with compassion, raised the money required, and released her. It was long before the affairs of the  
Jacobs' family were so far retrieved as to enable them  
to refund the money to the noble-hearted fisherman.  
How many others lingered in prison, or how long, we  
have no means of ascertaining.</p>  
<p>In reviewing the proceedings at the examinations  
and trials, it is impossible to avoid being struck with  
the infatuation of the magistrates and judges. They  
acted throughout in the character and spirit of prosecuting officers, put leading and ensnaring questions  
to the prisoners, adopted a browbeating deportment  
towards them, and pursued them with undisguised  
hostility. They assumed their guilt from the first,  
<pb n="355" id="vII355"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2368">  
<figDesc>Page 355.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and endeavored to force them to confess; treating them  
as obstinate culprits because they would not. Every  
kind of irregularity was permitted. The marshal was  
encouraged in perpetual interference to prejudice the  
persons on trial, watching and reporting aloud to the  
Court every movement of their hands or heads or  
feet. Other persons were allowed to speak out, from  
the body of the crowd, whatever they chose to say adverse to the prisoner. Accusers were suffered to make  
private communications to the magistrates and judges  
before or during the hearings. The presiding officers  
showed off their smartness in attempts to make the  
persons on trial before them appear at a disadvantage.  
In some instances, as in the case of Sarah Good, the  
magistrate endeavored to deceive the accused by representing falsely the testimony given by another. The  
people in and around the court-room were allowed to  
act the part of a noisy mob, by clamors and threatening outcries; and juries were overawed to bring in  
verdicts of conviction, and rebuked from the bench if  
they exercised their rightful prerogative without regard  
to the public passions. The chief-justice, in particular,  
appears to have been actuated by violent prejudice  
against the prisoners, and to have conducted the trials,  
all along, with a spirit that bears the aspect of animosity.</p>  
<p>There is one point of view in which he must be held  
responsible for the blood that was shed, and the infamy that, in consequence, attaches to the proceedings.  
It may well be contended, that not a conviction would  
<pb n="356" id="vII356"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2369">  
<figDesc>Page 356.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
have taken place, but for a notion of his which he  
arbitrarily enforced as a rule of law. It was a part of  
the theory relating to witchcraft, that the Devil made  
use of the spectres, or apparitions, of some persons to  
afflict others. From this conceded postulate, a division  
of opinion arose. Some maintained that the Devil  
could employ only the spectres of persons in league  
with him; others affirmed, that he could send upon his  
evil errands the spectres of innocent persons, without  
their consent or knowledge. The chief-justice held the  
former opinion, against the judgment of many others,  
arbitrarily established it as a rule of Court, and peremptorily instructed juries to regard it as binding  
upon them in making their verdicts. The consequence was that a verdict of &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; became inevitable. But few at that time doubted the veracity of the  
&ldquo;afflicted persons,&rdquo; which was thought to be demonstrated to the very senses by their fits and sufferings,  
in the presence of the Court, jury, and all beholders.  
When they swore that they saw the shapes of Bridget  
Bishop, or Rebecca Nurse, or George Burroughs,  
choking or otherwise torturing a person, the fact was  
regarded as beyond question.</p>  
<p>The prisoners took the ground, that the statements  
made by the witnesses, even if admitted, were not proof  
against them; for the Devil might employ the spectres of innocent persons, or of whomsoever he chose,  
without the knowledge of the persons whose shapes  
were thus used by him. When Mrs. Ann Putnam  
swore that she had seen the spectre of Rebecca Nurse  
<pb n="357" id="vII357"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2370">  
<figDesc>Page 357.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
afflicting various persons; and that the said spectre  
acknowledged to her, that &ldquo;she had killed Benjamin  
Houlton, and John Fuller, and Rebecca Shepard,&rdquo; &mdash;  
the answer of the prisoner was, &ldquo;I cannot help it: the  
Devil may appear in my shape.&rdquo; When the examining  
magistrate put the question to Susanna Martin, &ldquo;How  
comes your appearance to hurt these?&rdquo; Martin replied, &ldquo;I cannot tell. He that appeared in Samuel's  
shape, a glorified saint, can appear in any one's shape.&rdquo;  
The Rev. John Wise, in his noble appeal in favor  
of John Procter, argued to the same point. But the  
chief-justice was inexorably deaf to all reason; compelled the jury to receive, as absolute law, that the  
Devil could not use the shape of an innocent person;  
and, as the &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; swore that they saw the shapes  
of the prisoners actually engaged in the diabolical  
work, there was no room left for question, and they  
must return a verdict of &ldquo;Guilty.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>In this way, innocent persons were slaughtered by a  
dogma in the mind of an obstinate judge. Dogmas  
have perverted courts and governments in all ages.  
A fabrication of fancy, an arbitrary verbal proposition,  
has been exalted above reason, and made to extinguish  
common sense. The world is full of such dogmas.  
They mislead the actions of men, and confound the  
page of history. &ldquo;The king cannot die&rdquo; is one of  
them. It is held as an axiom of political and constitutional truth. So an entire dynasty, crowded with  
a more glorious life than any other, is struck from the  
annals of an empire. In the public records of England,  
<pb n="358" id="vII358"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2371">  
<figDesc>Page 358.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the existence of the Commonwealth is ignored;  
and the traces of its great events are erased from the  
archives of the government, which, in all its formulas  
and official papers, proclaims a lie. A hunted fugitive,  
wandering in disguise through foreign lands, without  
a foot of ground on the globe that he could call his own,  
is declared in all public acts, parliamentary and judicial,  
and even by those assuming to utter the voice of  
history, to have actually reigned all the time. In our  
country and in our day, we are perplexed, and our  
public men bewildered, by a similar dogma. The  
merest fabric of human contrivance, a particular form  
of political society, is impiously clothed with an  
essential attribute of God alone; and ephemeral politicians are announcing, as an eternal law of Providence,  
that &ldquo;a State cannot die.&rdquo; The mischiefs that result,  
in the management of human affairs, from enthroning  
dogmas over reason, truth, and fact, are, as they ever  
have been, incalculable.</p>  
<p>Chief-justice Stoughton appears to have kept his  
mind chained to his dogma to the last. It rendered  
him wholly incapable of opening his eyes to the light  
of truth. He held on to spectral evidence, and his  
corollary from it, when everybody else had abandoned both. He would not admit that he, or any one  
concerned, had been in error. He never could bear to  
hear any persons express penitence or regret for the  
part they had taken in the proceedings. When the  
public delusion had so far subsided that it became  
difficult to procure the execution of a witch, he was  
<pb n="359" id="vII359"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2372">  
<figDesc>Page 359.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
disturbed and incensed to such a degree that he  
abandoned his seat on the bench. During a session of  
the Court at Charlestown, in January, 1692-3, &ldquo;word  
was brought in, that a reprieve was sent to Salem, and  
had prevented the execution of seven of those that  
were there condemned, which so moved the chief  
judge that he said to this effect: `We were in a way  
to have cleared the land of them; who it is that  
obstructs the cause of justice, I know not: the Lord  
be merciful to the country!' and so went off the  
bench, and came no more into that Court.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>I have spoken of the judges as appearing to be infatuated, not on account of the opinions they held on  
the subject of witchcraft, for these were the opinions  
of their age; nor from the peculiar doctrine their  
chief enforced upon them, for that was entertained by  
many, and, as a mere theory, was perhaps as logically  
deducible from the prevalent doctrines as any other.  
Their infatuation consisted in not having eyes to see,  
or ears to hear, evidences continually occurring of the  
untruthful arts and tricks of the afflicted children, of  
their cunning evasinos, and, in some instances, palpable  
falsehoods. Then, further, there was solid and substantial evidence before them that ought to have made  
them pause and consider, if not doubt and disbelieve.  
We find the following paper among the files: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of John Putnam, Sr., and Rebecca  
his Wife,</hi> saith that our son-in-law John Fuller, and our  
daughter Rebecca Shepard, did both of them die a most  
violent death (and died acting very strangely at the time of  
<pb n="360" id="vII360"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2373">  
<figDesc>Page 360.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
their death); further saith, that we did judge then that they  
both died of a malignant fever, and had no suspicion of  
withcraft of any, neither can we accuse the prisoner at the  
bar of any such thing.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>When we recall the testimony of Ann Putnam the  
mother, and find that the afflicted generally charged  
the death of the above-named persons upon the shape  
of Rebecca Nurse, we perceive how absolutely Captain  
John Putnam and his wife discredit their testimony.  
The opinion of the father and mother of Fuller and  
Shepard ought to have had weight with the Court.  
They were persons of the highest standing, and of  
recognized intelligence and judgment. They were old  
church-members, and eminently orthodox in all their  
sentiments. They were the heads of a great family.  
He had represented the town in the General Court  
the year before. No man in this part of the country  
was more noted for strong good sense than Captain  
John Putnam. This deposition is honorable to their  
memory, and clears them from all responsibility for  
the extent to which the afflicted persons were allowed  
to sway the judgment of the Court. Taken in connection with the paper signed by so large a portion  
of the best people of the village, in behalf of Rebecca  
Nurse, it proves that the blame for the shocking proceedings in the witchcraft prosecutions cannot be laid  
upon the local population, but rests wholly upon the  
Court and the public authorities.</p>  
<p>The Special Court that condemned the persons  
charged with witchcraft in 1692 is justly open to  
<pb n="361" id="vII361"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2374">  
<figDesc>Page 361.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
censure for the absence of all discrimination of evidence, and for a prejudgment of the cases submitted  
to them. In view of the then existing law and the  
practice in the mother-country under it, they ought  
to have the benefit of the admission that they did, in  
other respects than those mentioned, no more and no  
worse than was to be expected. And Cotton Mather,  
in the &ldquo;Magnalia,&rdquo; vindicates them on this ground: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;They consulted the precedents of former times, and  
precepts laid down by learned writers about witchcraft; as,  
Keeble on the Common Law, chap. `Conjuration' (an author  
approved by the twelve judges of our nation): also, Sir  
Matthew Hale's Trials of Witches, printed anno 1682;  
Glanvill's Collection of Sundry Trials in England and Ireland in the years 1658, '61, '63, '64, and '81; Bernard's  
Guide to Jury-men; Baxter's and R. B., their histories about  
Witches, and their Discoveries; Cotton Mather's Memorable Providences relating to Witchcraft, printed 1685.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>So far as the medical profession at the time is  
concerned, it must be admitted that they bear a full  
share of responsibility for the proceedings. They gave  
countenance and currency to the idea of witchcraft  
in the public mind, and were very generally in the  
habit, when a patient did not do well under their prescriptions, of getting rid of all difficulty by saying  
that &ldquo;an evil hand&rdquo; was upon him. Their opinion  
to this effect is cited throughout, and appears in a  
large number of the documents. There were coroners'  
juries in cases where it was suspected that a person  
<pb n="362" id="vII362"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2375">  
<figDesc>Page 362.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
died of witchcraft. It is much to be regretted that  
none of their verdicts have been preserved. Drawn  
up by an attending &ldquo;chirurgeon,&rdquo; they would illustrate the state of professional science at that day, by  
informing us of the marks, indications, and conditions  
of the bodily organization by which the traces of the  
Devil's hand were believed to be discoverable. All  
we know is that, in particular cases, as that of Bray  
Wilkins's grandson Daniel, the jury found decisive  
proof that he had died by &ldquo;an evil hand.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>It is not to be denied or concealed, that the clergy  
were instrumental in bringing on the witchcraft delusion in 1692. As the supposed agents of the mischief  
belonged to the supernatural and spiritual world, which  
has ever been considered their peculiar province, it was  
thought that the advice and co-operation of ministers  
were particularly appropriate and necessary. Opposition to prevailing vices and attempts to reform society  
were considered at that time in the light of a conflict  
with Satan himself; and he was thought to be the ablest  
minister who had the greatest power over the invisible  
enemy, and could most easily and effectively avert his  
blows, and counteract his baleful influence. This  
gave the clergy the front in the battle against the  
hosts of Belial. They were proud of the position,  
and were stimulated to distinguish themselves in the  
conflict. Cotton Mather represents that ministers  
were honored by the special hostility of the great  
enemy of souls, &ldquo;more dogged by the Devil than  
any other men,&rdquo; just as, according to his philosophy,  
<pb n="363" id="vII363"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2376">  
<figDesc>Page 363.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the lightning struck the steeples of churches more  
frequently than other buildings because the Prince  
of the Power of the Air particularly hated the places  
where the sound of the gospel was heard. There were,  
moreover, it is to be feared, ministers whose ambition  
to acquire influence and power had been allowed to  
become a ruling principle, and who favored the delusion because thereby their object could be most  
surely achieved by carrying the people to the greatest extremes of credulity, superstition, and fanatical  
blindness.</p>  
<p>But justice requires it to be said that the ministers,  
as a general thing, did not take the lead after the  
proceedings had assumed their most violent aspect,  
and the disastrous effects been fully brought to view.  
It may be said, on the contrary, that they took the  
lead, as a class, in checking the delusion, and rescuing  
the public mind from its control. Prior to the time  
when they were called upon to give their advice to the  
government, they probably followed Cotton Mather:  
after that, they seemed to have freed themselves generally from his influence. The names of Dane and  
Barnard of Andover, Higginson of Salem, Cheever  
of Marblehead, Hubbard and Wise of Ipswich, Payson  
and Phillips of Rowley, Allin of Salisbury, and Capen  
of Topsfield, appear in behalf of persons accused.  
To come forward in their defence shows courage, and  
proves that their influence was in the right direction,  
even while the proceedings were at their height. Mr.  
Hale, of Beverly, abandoned the prosecutions, and expressed  
<pb n="364" id="vII364"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2377">  
<figDesc>Page 364.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
his disapprobation of them, before the government or the Court relaxed the vigor of their operations, as is sufficiently proved by the fact that the  
&ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; cried out against his wife. Willard, and James Allen, and Moody, and John Bailey,  
and even Increase Mather, of Boston, openly discountenanced the course things were taking. The latter  
circulated a letter from his London correspondent, a  
person whose opinion was entitled to weight, condemning in the strongest terms the doctrine of the  
chief-justice, as follows: &ldquo;All that I speak with  
much wonder that any man, much less a man of such  
abilities, learning, and experience as Mr. Stoughton,  
should take up a persuasion that the Devil cannot  
assume the likeness of an innocent, to afflict another  
person. In my opinion, it is a persuasion utterly  
destitute of any solid reason to render it so much  
as probable.&rdquo; The ministers may have been among  
the first to bring on the delusion; but the foregoing  
facts prove, that, as a profession, they were the first  
to attempt to check and discountenance the prosecutions. While we are required, in all fairness, to  
give this credit to the clergy in general, it would be  
false to the obligations of historical truth and justice  
to attempt to palliate the conduct of some of them.  
Whoever considers all that Mr. Parris, according to  
his own account, said and did, cannot but shrink  
from the necessity of passing judgment upon him,  
and find relief in leaving him to that tribunal which  
alone can measure the extent of human responsibility,  
<pb n="365" id="vII365"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2378">  
<figDesc>Page 365.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and sound the depths of the heart. Lawson threw  
into the conflagration all the combustible materials  
his eloquence and talents, heated, it is to be feared,  
by resentment, could contribute. Dr. Bentley, in his  
&ldquo;Description and History of Salem&rdquo; (Mass. Hist.  
Coll., 1st series, vol. vi.) says, &ldquo;Mr. Noyes came out  
and publicly confessed his error, never concealed a  
circumstance, never excused himself; visited, loved,  
blessed, the survivors whom he had injured; asked  
forgiveness always, and consecrated the residue of  
his life to bless mankind.&rdquo; It is to be hoped that  
the statement is correct. There were several points  
of agreement between Noyes and Bentley. Both were  
men of ability and learning. Like Bentley, Noyes  
lived and died a bachelor; and, like him, was a man of  
lively and active temperament, and, in the general tenor  
of his life, benevolent and disinterested. Perhaps congeniality in these points led Bentley to make the statement, just quoted, a little too strong. He wrote more  
than a century after the witchcraft proceedings; just  
at that point when tradition had become inflated by  
all manner of current talk, of fable mixed with fact,  
before the correcting and expunging hand of a severe  
scrutiny of records and documents had commenced  
its work. The drag-net of time had drawn along  
with it every thing that anybody had said; but the  
process of sifting and discrimination had not begun.  
His kindly and ingenuous nature led him to believe,  
and prompted him to write down, all that was amiable, and pleasing to a mind like his. So far as the  
<pb n="366" id="vII366"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2379">  
<figDesc>Page 366.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
records and documents give us information, there is  
reason to apprehend, that Mr. Noyes, like Stoughton,  
another old bachelor, never recovered his mind from  
the frame of feeling or conviction in which it was  
during the proceedings. His name is not found, as  
are those of other ministers, to any petitions, memorials or certificates, in favor of the sufferers during  
the trials, or of reparation to their memories or to the  
feelings of their friends. He does not appear to have  
taken any part in arresting the delusion or rectifying  
the public mind.</p>  
<p>Of Cotton Mather, more is required to be said. He  
aspired to be considered the leading champion of the  
Church, and the most successful combatant against the  
Satanic powers. He seems to have longed for an opportunity to signalize himself in this particular kind of  
warfare; seized upon every occurrence that would admit  
of such a coloring to represent it as the result of diabolical agency; circulated in his numerous publications  
as many tales of witchcraft as he could collect throughout New and Old England, and repeatedly endeavored  
to get up cases of the kind in Boston. There is  
some ground for suspicion that he was instrumental  
in originating the fanaticism in Salem; at any rate, he  
took a leading part in fomenting it. And while there  
is evidence that he endeavored, after the delusion subsided, to escape the disgrace of having approved of the  
proceedings, and pretended to have been in some  
measure opposed to them, it can be too clearly shown  
that he was secretly and cunningly endeavoring to  
<pb n="367" id="vII367"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2380">  
<figDesc>Page 367.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
renew them during the next year in his own parish in  
Boston.<note target="v2n5">*</note></p>  
<p>How blind is man to the future! The state of  
things which Cotton Mather labored to bring about, in  
order that he might increase his own influence over an  
infatuated people, by being regarded by them as mighty  
<pb n="368" id="vII368"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2381">  
<figDesc>Page 368.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to cast out and vanquish evil spirits, and as able to  
hold Satan himself in chains by his prayers and his  
piety, brought him at length into such disgrace that  
his power was broken down, and he became the object  
of public ridicule and open insult. And the excitement that had been produced for the purpose of  
<pb n="369" id="vII369"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2382">  
<figDesc>Page 369.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
restoring and strengthening the influence of the clerical  
and spiritual leaders resulted in effects which reduced  
that influence to a still lower point. The intimate  
connection of Dr. Mather and other prominent ministers  
with the witchcraft delusion brought a reproach upon  
the clergy from which they have not yet recovered.</p>  
<pb n="370" id="vII370"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2383">  
<figDesc>Page 370.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>In addition to the designing exertions of ambitious  
ecclesiastics, and the benevolent and praiseworthy  
efforts of those whose only aim was to promote a real  
and thorough reformation of religion, all the passions  
of our nature stood ready to throw their concentrated  
energy into the excitement (as they are sure to do,  
whatever may be its character), so soon as it became  
sufficiently strong to encourage their action.</p>  
<p>The whole force of popular superstition, all the  
<pb n="371" id="vII371"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2384">  
<figDesc>Page 371.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fanatical propensities of the ignorant and deluded multitude, united with the best feelings of our nature to  
heighten the fury of the storm. Piety was indignant  
at the supposed rebellion against the sovereignty of  
God, and was roused to an extreme of agitation and  
apprehension in witnessing such a daring and fierce  
assault by the Devil and his adherents upon the  
churches and the cause of the gospel. Virtue was  
shocked at the tremendous guilt of those who were  
believed to have entered the diabolical confederacy;  
while public order and security stood aghast, amidst  
the invisible, the supernatural, the infernal, and  
apparently the irresistible attacks that were making  
upon the foundations of society. In baleful combination with principles, good in themselves, thus  
urging the passions into wild operation, there were  
all the wicked and violent affections to which humanity is liable. Theological bitterness, personal animosities, local controversies, private feuds, long-cherished  
grudges, and professional jealousies, rushed forward,  
and raised their discordant voices, to swell the horrible  
din; credulity rose with its monstrous and ever form, on the ruins of truth, reason, and the  
senses; malignity and cruelty rode triumphant through  
the storm, by whose fury every mild and gentle sentiment had been shipwrecked; and revenge, smiling in  
the midst of the tempest, welcomed its desolating  
wrath as it dashed the mangled objects of its hate  
along the shore.</p>  
<p>The treatment of the prisoners, by the administrative  
<pb n="372" id="vII372"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2385">  
<figDesc>Page 372.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and subordinate officers in charge of them, there  
is reason to apprehend, was more than ordinarily  
harsh and unfeeling. The fate of Willard prevented  
expressions of kindness towards them. The crime  
of which they were accused put them outside of the  
pale of human charities. All who believed them guilty  
looked upon them, not only with horror, but hate. To  
have deliberately abandoned God and heaven, the  
salvation of Christ and the brotherhood of man, was  
regarded as detestable, execrable, and utterly and for  
ever damnable. This was the universal feeling at  
the time when the fanaticism was at its height; or,  
if there were any dissenters, they dared not show  
themselves. What the poor innocent sufferers experienced of cruelty, wrong, and outrage from this  
cause, it is impossible for words to tell. It left them  
in prison to neglect, ignominious ill-treatment, and  
abusive language from the menials having charge of  
them; it made their trials a brutal mockery; it  
made the pathway to the gallows a series of insults  
from an exasperated mob. If dear relatives or faithful friends kept near them, they did it at the peril  
of their lives, and were forbidden to utter the sentiments with which their hearts were breaking. There  
was no sympathy for those who died, or for those  
who mourned.</p>  
<p>It may seem strange to us, at this distance of time,  
and with the intelligence prevalent in this age, that  
persons of such known, established, and eminent reputation as many of those whose cases have been particularly  
<pb n="373" id="vII373"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2386">  
<figDesc>Page 373.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
noticed, could possibly have been imagined  
guilty of the crime imputed to them. The question  
arises in every mind, Why did not their characters  
save them from conviction, and even from suspicion?  
The answer is to be found in the peculiar views then  
entertained of the power and agency of Satan. It was  
believed that it would be one of the signs of his coming  
to destroy the Church of Christ, that some of the  
&ldquo;elect&rdquo; would be seduced into his service, &mdash; that he  
would drag captive in his chains, and pervert into  
instruments to further his wicked cause, many who  
stood among the highest in the confidence of Christians. This belief made them more vehement in their  
proceedings against ministers, church-members, and  
persons of good repute, who were proved, by the overwhelming evidence of the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; and  
the confessing witches, to have made a compact with  
the Devil. There is reason to fear that Mr. Burroughs, and all accused persons of the highest reputation before for piety and worth, especially all who  
had been professors of religion and accredited church, suffered more than others from the severity  
of the judges and executive officers of the law, and  
from the rage and hatred of the people. It was indeed necessary, in order to keep up the delusion  
and maintain the authority of the prosecutions, to  
break down the influence of those among the accused  
and the sufferers who had stood the highest, and bore  
themselves the best through the fiery ordeal of the  
examinations, trials, and executions.</p>  
<pb n="374" id="vII374"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2387">  
<figDesc>Page 374.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>It is indeed a very remarkable fact, which has  
justly been enlarged upon by several who have had  
their attention turned to this subject, that, of the  
whole number that suffered, none, in the final scene,  
lost their fortitude for a moment. Many were quite  
aged; a majority, women, of whom some, brought up  
in delicacy, were wholly unused to rough treatment  
or physical suffering. They must have undergone  
the most dreadful hardships, suddenly snatched from  
their families and homes; exposed to a torrent of  
false accusations imputing to them the most odious,  
shameful, and devilish crimes; made objects of the  
abhorrence of their neighbors, and, through the notoriety of the affair, of the world; carried to and fro,  
over rugged roads, from jail to jail, too often by unfeeling sub-officials; immured in crowded, filthy, and  
noisome prisons; heavily loaded with chains, in dungeons; left to endure insufficient attention to necessary personal wants, often with inadequate food and  
clothing; all expressions of sympathy for them withheld and forbidden, &mdash; those who ought to have been  
their comforters denouncing them in the most awful  
language, and consigning them to the doom of excommunication from the church on earth and from  
the hope of heaven. Surely, there have been few  
cases in the dark and mournful annals of human  
suffering and wrong, few instances of &ldquo;man's inhumanity to man,&rdquo; to be compared with what the victims of this tragedy endured. Their bearing through  
the whole, from the arrest to the scaffold, reflects  
<pb n="375" id="vII375"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2388">  
<figDesc>Page 375.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
credit upon our common nature. The fact that Wardwell lost his firmness, for a time, ought not to exclude  
his name from the honored list. Its claim to be  
enrolled on it was nobly retrieved by his recantation,  
and his manly death.</p>  
<p>There is one consideration that imparts a higher  
character to the deportment of these persons than  
almost any of the tests to which the firmness of the  
mind of man has ever been exposed. There was  
nothing outside of the mind to hold it up, but every  
thing to bear it down. All that they had in this world,  
all on which they could rest a hope for the next, was  
the consciousness of their innocence. Their fidelity  
to this sense of innocence &mdash; for a lie would have saved  
them &mdash; their unfaltering allegiance to this consciousness; the preservation of a calm, steadfast, serene  
mind; their faith and their prayers, rising above the  
maledictions of a maniac mob, in devotion to God and  
forgiveness to men, and, as in the case of Martha Corey  
and George Burroughs, in clear and collected expressions, &mdash; this was truly sublime. It was appreciated,  
at the time, by many a heart melted back to its  
humanity; and paved the way for the deliverance of  
the world, we trust for ever, from all such delusions,  
horrors, and spectacles. The sufferers in 1692 deserve  
to be held in grateful remembrance for having illustrated the dignity of which our nature is capable; for  
having shown that integrity of conscience is an armor  
which protects the peace of the soul against all the  
powers that can assail it; and for having given an  
<pb n="376" id="vII376"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2389">  
<figDesc>Page 376.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
example, that will be seen of all and in all times, of  
a courage, constancy, and faithfulness of which all  
are capable, and which can give the victory over  
infirmities of age, weaknesses and pains of body, and  
the most appalling combination of outrages to the  
mind and heart that can be accumulated by the violence and the wrath of man. Superstition and ignorance consigned their names to obloquy, and shrouded  
them in darkness. But the day has dawned; the shadows are passing away; truth has risen; the reign of  
superstition is over; and justice will be done to all  
who have been true to themselves, and stood fast  
to the integrity of their souls, even to the death.</p>  
<p>The place selected for the executions is worthy of  
notice. It was at a considerable distance from the jail,  
and could be reached only by a circuitous and difficult  
route. It is a fatiguing enterprise to get at it now,  
although many passages that approach it from some  
directions have since been opened. But it was a point  
where the spectacle would be witnessed by the whole  
surrounding country far and near, being on the brow  
of the highest eminence in the vicinity of the town.  
As it was believed by the people generally that they  
were engaged in a great battle with Satan, one of  
whose titles was &ldquo;the Prince of the Power of the  
Air,&rdquo; perhaps they chose that spot to execute his confederates, because, in going to that high point, they  
were flaunting him in his face, celebrating their triumph over him in his own realm. There is no contemporaneous nor immediately subsequent record, that  
<pb n="377" id="vII377"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2390">  
<figDesc>Page 377.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the executions took place on the spot assigned by  
tradition; but that tradition has been uniform and  
continuous, and appears to be verified by a singular  
item of evidence that has recently come to light. A  
letter written by the late venerable Dr. Holyoke to a  
friend at a distance, dated Salem, Nov. 25, 1791, has  
found its way back to the possession of one of his grand, which contains the following passage: &ldquo;In  
the last month, there died a man in this town, by the  
name of John Symonds, aged a hundred years lacking  
about six months, having been born in the famous '92.  
He has told me that his nurse had often told him, that,  
while she was attending his mother at the time she lay  
in with him, she saw, from the chamber windows, those  
unhappy people hanging on Gallows' Hill, who were  
executed for witches by the delusion of the times.&rdquo;  
John Symonds lived and died near the southern end  
of Beverly Bridge, on the south side of what is now  
Bridge Street. He was buried from his house, and  
Dr. Bentley made the funeral prayer, in which he is  
said to have used this language: &ldquo;O God! the man  
who with his own hands felled the trees, and hewed  
the timbers, and erected the house in which we are  
now assembled, was the ancestor of him whose remains we are about to inter.&rdquo; It is inferrible from  
this that Symonds was born in the house from which  
he was buried. Gallows Hill, now &ldquo;Witch Hill&rdquo; is in  
full view from that spot, and would be from the  
chamber windows of a house there, at any time, even  
in the season when intervening trees were in their  
<pb n="378" id="vII378"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2391">  
<figDesc>Page 378.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fullest foliage, while no other point in that direction  
would be discernible. From the only other locality  
of persons of the name of Symonds, at that time,  
in North Fields near the North Bridge, Witch Hill  
is also visible, and the only point in that direction  
that then would have been.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Witch Hill&rdquo; is a part of an elevated ledge of  
rock on the western side of the city of Salem, broken  
at intervals; beginning at Legg's Hill, and trending  
northerly. The turnpike from Boston enters Salem  
through one of the gaps in this ridge, which has been  
widened, deepened, and graded. North of the turnpike, it rises abruptly to a considerable elevation, called  
&ldquo;Norman's Rocks.&rdquo; At a distance of between three  
and four hundred feet, it sinks again, making a wide  
and deep gulley; and then, about a third of a mile  
from the turnpike, it re-appears, in a precipitous and,  
at its extremity, inaccessible cliff, of the height of  
fifty or sixty feet. Its southern and western aspect,  
as seen from the rough land north of the turnpike, is  
given in the headpiece of the Third Part, at the beginning of this volume. Its sombre and desolate appearance admits of little variety of delineation. It is  
mostly a bare and naked ledge. At the top of this  
cliff, on the southern brow of the eminence, the executions are supposed to have taken place. The outline rises a little towards the north, but soon begins to  
fall off to the general level of the country. From that  
direction only can the spot be easily reached. It is  
hard to climb the western side, impossible to clamber

up the southern face. Settlement creeps down from  
the north, and has partially ascended the eastern acclivity, but can never reach the brink. Scattered  
patches of soil are too thin to tempt cultivation, and  
the rock is too craggy and steep to allow occupation.  
An active and flourishing manufacturing industry  
crowds up to its base; but a considerable surface at  
the top will for ever remain an open space. It is, as  
it were, a platform raised high in air.</p>  
<p>A magnificent panorama of ocean, island, headland,  
bay, river, town, field, and forest spreads out and  
around to view. On a clear summer day, the picture  
can scarcely be surpassed. Facing the sun and the  
sea, and the evidences of the love and bounty of  
Providence shining over the landscape, the last look  
of earth must have suggested to the sufferers a wide  
contrast between the mercy of the Creator and the  
wrath of his creatures. They beheld the face of the  
blessed God shining upon them in his works, and they  
passed with renewed and assured faith into his more  
immediate presence. The elevated rock, uplifted by  
the divine hand, will stand while the world stands,  
in bold relief, and can never be obscured by the  
encroachments of society or the structures of art, &mdash;  
a fitting memorial of their constancy.</p>  
<p>When, in some coming day, a sense of justice, appreciation of moral firmness, sympathy for suffering  
innocence, the diffusion of refined sensibility, a discriminating discernment of what is really worthy of  
commemoration among men, a rectified taste, a generous

public spirit, and gratitude for the light that  
surrounds and protects us against error, folly, and  
fanaticism, shall demand the rearing of a suitable  
monument to the memory of those who in 1692 preferred death to a falsehood, the pedestal for the lofty  
column will be found ready, reared by the Creator on  
a foundation that can never be shaken while the globe  
endures, or worn away by the elements, man, or time  
&mdash; the brow of Witch Hill. On no other spot could  
such a tribute be more worthily bestowed, or more  
conspicuously displayed.</p>

<note id="v2n4"><p>* On the 19th of October, 1692, Thomas Hart, of Lynn, presented  
a memorial to the General Court, stating that his mother, Elizabeth  
Hart, had then been in Boston jail for nearly six months: &ldquo;Though,  
in all this time, nothing has appeared against her whereby to render  
her deserving of imprisonment or death,... being ancient, and not able  
to undergo the hardship that is inflicted from lying in misery, and  
death rather to be chosen than a life in her circumstances.&rdquo; He says,  
that his father is &ldquo;ancient and decrepit, and wholly unable&rdquo; to take  
any steps in her behalf; that he feels &ldquo;obliged by all Christian duty,  
as becomes a child to parents,&rdquo; to lay her case before the General  
Court. &ldquo;The petitioner having lived from his childhood under the  
same roof with his mother, he dare presume to affirm that he never  
saw nor knew any evil or sinful practice wherein there was any show  
of impiety nor witchcraft by her; and, were it otherwise, he would  
not, for the world and all the enjoyments thereof, nourish or support  
any creature that he knew engaged in the drudgery of Satan. It is  
well known to all the neighborhood, that the petitioner's mother has  
lived a sober and godly life, always ready to discharge the part of a  
good Christian, and never deserving of afflictions from the hands  
of men for any thing of this nature.&rdquo; He humbly prays &ldquo;for the  
speedy enlargement of this person so much abused.&rdquo; I present two  
more petitions. They help to fill up the picture of the sufferings and  
hardships borne by individuals and families.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">To the Honored General Court now sitting in Boston, the Humble Petition  
of Nicholas Rist, of Reading, showeth,</hi> that whereas Sara Rist, wife of the  
petitioner, was taken into custody the first day of June last, and, ever  
since lain in Boston jail for witchcraft; though, in all this time, nothing has  
been made appear for which she deserved imprisonment or death: the petitioner has been a husband to the said woman above twenty years, in all  
which time he never had reason to accuse her for any impiety or witchcraft, but the contrary. She lived with him as a good, faithful, dutiful  
wife, and always had respect to the ordinances of God while her strength  
remained; and the petitioner, on that consideration, is obliged in conscience  
and justice to use all lawful means for the support and preservation of her  
life; and it is deplorable, that, in old age, the poor decrepit woman should  
lie under confinement so long in a stinking jail, when her circumstances  
rather require a nurse to attend her.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;May it, therefore, please Your Honors to take this matter into your  
prudent consideration, and direct some speedy methods whereby this ancient decrepit person may not for ever lie in such misery, wherein her life is  
made more afflictive to her than death.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Humble Petition of Thomas Barrett, of Chelmsford, in New England, in behalf of his daughter Martha Sparkes, wife of Henry Sparkes, who  
is now a soldier in Their Majesties' Service at the Eastern Parts, and so hath  
been for a considerable time, humbly showeth,</hi> That your petitioner's daughter  
hath lain in prison in Boston for the space of twelve months and five days,  
being committed by Thomas Danforth, Esq., the late deputy-governor, upon  
suspicion of witchcraft; since which no evidence hath appeared against her  
in any such matter, neither hath any given bond to prosecute her, nor  
doth any one at this day accuse her of any such thing, as your petitioner  
knows of. That your petitioner hath ever since kept two of her children;  
the one of five years, the other of two years old, which hath been a considerable trouble and charge to him in his poor and mean condition: besides,  
your petitioner hath a lame, ancient, and sick wife, who, for these five  
years and upwards past, hath been so afflicted as that she is altogether  
rendered uncapable of affording herself any help, which much augments  
his trouble. Your poor petitioner earnestly and humbly entreats Your  
Excellency and Honors to take his distressed condition into your consideration; and that you will please to order the releasement of his daughter  
from her confinement, whereby she may return home to her poor children  
to look after them, having nothing to pay the charge of her confinement.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And your petitioner, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Nov. 1, 1692.&rdquo;</p></q></note>  
<note id="v2n5"><p>* I know nothing more artful and jesuitical than his attempts to  
avoid the reproach of having been active in carrying on the delusion  
in Salem and elsewhere, and, at the same time, to keep up such a  
degree of credulity and superstition in the minds of the people as to  
render it easy to plunge them into it again at the first favorable  
moment. In the following passages, he endeavors to escape the odium  
that had been connected with the prosecutions: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The world knows how many pages I have composed and published, and particular gentlemen in the government know how many  
letters I have written, to prevent the excessive credit of spectral accusations.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;In short, I do humbly but freely affirm it, that there is not a  
man living in this world, who has been more desirous than the poor  
man I to shelter my neighbors from the inconveniences of spectral  
outcries: yea, I am very jealous I have done so much that way as to  
sin in what I have done; such have been the cowardice and fearfulness whereunto my regard unto the dissatisfaction of other people has  
precipitated me. I know a man in the world, who has thought he has  
been able to convict some such witches as ought to die; but his respect unto the public peace has caused him rather to try whether he  
could not renew them by repentance.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>In his Life of Sir William Phips, he endeavors to take the credit  
to himself of having doubted the propriety of the proceedings while  
they were in progress. This work was published without his name,  
in order that he might commend himself with more freedom. The  
advice given by the ministers of Boston and the vicinity to the government has been spoken of. Cotton Mather frequently took occasion  
to applaud and magnify the merit of this production. In one of his  
writings, he speaks of &ldquo;the gracious words&rdquo; it contained. In his Life  
of Phips, he thus modestly takes the credit of its authorship to himself: it was &ldquo;drawn up, at their (the ministers') desire, by Mr. Mather  
the younger, as I have been informed.&rdquo; And, in order the more  
effectually to give the impression that he was rather opposed to the  
proceedings, he quotes those portions of the paper which recommended  
caution and circumspection, leaving out those other passages in which  
it was vehemently urged to carry the proceedings on &ldquo;speedily and  
vigorously.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>This single circumstance is decisive of the disingenuity of Dr.  
Mather. As it was the purpose of the government, in requesting the  
advice of the ministers, to ascertain their opinion of the expediency  
of continuing the prosecutions, it was a complete and deliberate perversion and falsification of their answer to omit the passages which  
encouraged the proceedings, and to record those only which recommended caution and circumspection. The object of Mather in suppressing the important parts of the document has, however, in some  
measure been answered. As the &ldquo;Magnalia,&rdquo; within which his Life of  
Phips is embraced, is the usual and popular source of information and  
reference respecting the topics of which it treats, the opinion has prevailed, that the Boston ministers, especially &ldquo;Mr. Mather the younger,&rdquo;  
endeavored to prevent the transactions connected with the trial and  
execution of the supposed witches. Unfortunately, however, for the  
reputation of Cotton Mather, Hutchinson has preserved the address of  
the ministers entire: and it appears that they approved, applauded, and  
stimulated the prosecutions; and that the people of Salem and the  
surrounding country were the victims of a delusion, the principal  
promoters of which have, to a great degree, been sheltered from reproach by the dishonest artifice, which has now been exposed.</p>  
<p>But, like other ambitious and grasping politicans, he was anxious to  
have the support of all parties at the same time. After making court  
to those who were dissatisfied with the prosecutions, he thus commends  
himself to all who approved of them: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;And why, after all my unwearied cares and pains to rescue the  
miserable from the lions and bears of hell which had seized them,  
and after all my studies to disappoint the devils in their designs to  
confound my neighborhood, must I be driven to the necessity of an  
apology? Truly, the hard representations wherewith some ill men  
have reviled my conduct, and the countenance which other men have  
given to these representations, oblige me to give mankind some  
account of my behavior. No Christian can (I say none but evilworkers can) criminate my visiting such of my poor flock as have at  
any time fallen under the terrible and sensible molestations of evil  
angels. Let their afflictions have been what they will, I could not have  
answered it unto my glorious Lord, if I had withheld my just comforts  
and counsels from them; and, if I have also, with some exactness,  
observed the methods of the invisible world, when they have thus become observable, I have been but a servant of mankind in doing so:  
yea, no less a person than the venerable Baxter has more than once or  
twice, in the most public manner, invited mankind to thank me for  
that service.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>In other passages, he thus continues to stimulate and encourage the  
advocates of the prosecutions: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Wherefore, instead of all apish shouts and jeers at histories  
which have such undoubted confirmation as that no man that has  
breeding enough to regard the common laws of human society will  
offer to doubt of them, it becomes us rather to adore the goodness of  
God, who does not permit such things every day to befall us all, as he  
sometimes did permit to befall some few of our miserable neighbors.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And it is a very glorious thing that I have now to mention: The  
devils have, with most horrid operations, broke in upon our neighborhood; and God has at such a rate overruled all the fury and malice  
of those devils, that all the afflicted have not only been delivered, but,  
I hope, also savingly brought home unto God; and the reputation of  
no one good person in the world has been damaged, but, instead  
thereof, the souls of many, especially of the rising generation, have  
been thereby awakened unto some acquaintance with religion. Our  
young people, who belonged unto the praying-meetings, of both sexes,  
apart, would ordinarily spend whole nights, by whole weeks together,  
in prayers and psalms upon these occasions, in which devotions the  
devils could get nothing but, like fools, a scourge for their own  
backs: and some scores of other young people, who were strangers to  
real piety, were now struck with the lively demonstrations of hell  
evidently set forth before their eyes, when they saw persons cruelly  
frighted, wounded and starved by devils, and scalded with burning  
brimstone, and yet so preserved in this tortured state, as that, at the  
end of one month's wretchedness, they were as able still to undergo  
another; so that, of these also, it might now be said, `Behold, they  
pray.' In the whole, the Devil got just nothing, but God got praises,  
Christ got subjects, the Holy Spirit got temples, the church got  
additions, and the souls of men got everlasting benefits. I am not so  
vain as to say that any wisdom or virtue of mine did contribute unto  
this good order of things; but I am so just as to say, I did not hinder  
this good.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>I cannot, indeed, resist the conviction, that, notwithstanding all his  
attempts to appear dissatisfied, after they had become unpopular, with  
the occurrences in the Salem trials, he looked upon them with secret  
pleasure, and would have been glad to have had them repeated in  
Boston.</p></note>

<p>The effects of the delusion upon the country at  
large were very disastrous. It cast its shadows over  
a broad surface, and they darkened the condition of  
generations. The material interests of the people  
long felt its blight. Breaking out at the opening of  
the season, it interrupted the planting and cultivating  
of the grounds. It struck an entire summer out of  
one year, and broke in upon another. The fields were  
neglected; fences, roads, barns, and even the meeting, went into disrepair. Burdens were accumulated upon the already over-taxed resources of the  
people. An actual scarcity of provisions, amounting  
almost to a famine, continued for some time to press  
upon families. Farms were brought under mortgage  
or sacrificed, and large numbers of the people were  
dispersed. One locality in the village, which was the  
scene of this wild and tragic fanaticism, bears to this  
day the marks of the blight then brought upon it.  
Although in the centre of a town exceeding almost  
<pb n="381" id="vII381"/>

<figDesc>Page 381.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
all others in its agricultural development and thrift,  
&mdash; every acre elsewhere showing the touch of modern  
improvement and culture, &mdash; the &ldquo;old meeting-house  
road,&rdquo; from the crossing of the Essex Railroad to the  
point where it meets the road leading north from Tapleyville, has to-day a singular appearance of abandonment. The Surveyor of Highways ignores it. The  
old, gray, moss-covered stone walls are dilapidated,  
and thrown out of line. Not a house is on either  
of its borders, and no gate opens or path leads to  
any. Neglect and desertion brood over the contiguous  
grounds. Indeed, there is but one house standing  
directly on the roadside until you reach the vicinity of  
the site of the old meeting-house; and that is owned  
and occupied by a family that bear the name and are  
the direct descendants of Rebecca Nurse. On both  
sides there are the remains of cellars, which declare  
that once it was lined by a considerable population.  
Along this road crowds thronged in 1692, for weeks  
and months, to witness the examinations.</p>  
<p>The ruinous results were not confined to the village,  
but extended more or less over the country generally.  
Excitement, wrought up to consternation, spread everywhere. People left their business and families, and  
came from distant points, to gratify their curiosity,  
and enable themselves to form a judgment of the character of the phenomena here exhibited. Strangers  
from all parts swelled the concourse, gathered to  
behold the sufferings of &ldquo;the afflicted&rdquo; as manifested  
at the examinations; and flocked to the surrounding  
<pb n="382" id="vII382"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2395">  
<figDesc>Page 382.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
eminences and the grounds immediately in front of  
Witch Hill, to catch a view of the convicts as they  
approached the place selected for their execution,  
offered their dying prayers, and hung suspended high  
in air. Such scenes always draw together great multitudes. None have possessed a deeper, stronger, or  
stranger attraction; and never has the dread spectacle  
been held out to view over a wider area, or from so  
conspicuous a spot. The assembling of such multitudes so often, for such a length of time, and from  
such remote quarters, must have been accompanied and  
followed by wasteful, and in all respects deleterious,  
effects. The continuous or frequently repeated sessions of the magistrates, grand jury, and jury of  
trials; and the attendance of witnesses summoned  
from other towns, or brought from beyond the jurisdiction of the Province, and of families and parties  
interested specially in the proceedings, &mdash; must have  
occasioned an extensive and protracted interruption  
of the necessary industrial pursuits of society, and  
heavily increased the public burdens.</p>  
<p>The destruction dealt upon particular families extended to so many as to constitute in the aggregate a  
vast, wide-spread calamity.<note target="v2n6">*</note></p>

<p>The facts that belong to the story of the witchcraft  
delusion of 1692, or that may in any way explain or  
illustrate it, so far as they can be gathered from the  
imperfect and scattered records and papers that have  
come down to us, have now been laid before you.  
But there are one or two inquiries that force themselves  
upon thoughtful minds, which demand consideration  
before we close the subject.</p>

<p>What are we to think of those persons who commenced and continued the accusations, &mdash; the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; and their associates?</p>  
<p>In some instances and to some extent, the steps  
they took and the testimony they bore may be explained by referring to the mysterious energies of the  
imagination, the power of enthusiasm, the influence  
of sympathy, and the general prevalence of credulity,  
<pb n="385" id="vII385"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2398">  
<figDesc>Page 385.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
ignorance, superstition, and fanaticism at the time;  
and it is not probable, that, when they began, they  
had any idea of the tremendous length to which  
they were finally led on.</p>  
<p>It was perhaps their original design to gratify a love  
of notoriety or of mischief by creating a sensation and  
excitement in their neighborhood, or, at the worst, to  
wreak their vengeance upon one or two individuals  
who had offended them. They soon, however, became  
intoxicated by the terrible success of their imposture,  
and were swept along by the frenzy they had occasioned. It would be much more congenial with our  
feelings to believe, that these misguided and wretched  
young persons early in the proceedings became themselves victims of the delusion into which they plunged  
every one else. But we are forbidden to form this  
charitable judgment by the manifestations of art and  
contrivance, of deliberate cunning and cool malice,  
they exhibited to the end. Once or twice they were  
caught in their own snare; and nothing but the  
blindness of the bewildered community saved them  
from disgraceful exposure and well-deserved punishment. They appeared as the prosecutors of every  
poor creature that was tried, and seemed ready to  
bear testimony against any one upon whom suspicion  
might happen to fall. It is dreadful to reflect upon  
the enormity of their wickedness, if they were conscious of imposture throughout. It seems to transcend the capabilities of human crime. There is,  
perhaps, a slumbering element in the heart of man,  
<pb n="386" id="vII386"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2399">  
<figDesc>Page 386.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that sleeps for ever in the bosom of the innocent and  
good, and requires the perpetration of a great sin  
to wake it into action, but which, when once aroused,  
impels the transgressor onward with increasing momentum, as the descending ball is accelerated in its  
course. It may be that crime begets an appetite for  
crime, which, like all other appetites, is not quieted  
but inflamed by gratification.</p>  
<p>Their precise moral condition, the degree of guilt  
to be ascribed, and the sentence to be passed upon  
them, can only be determined by a considerate review of all the circumstances and influences around  
them.</p>  
<p>For a period embracing about two months, they had  
been in the habit of meeting together, and spending  
the long winter evenings, at Mr. Parris's house, practising the arts of fortune-telling, jugglery, and magic.  
What they had heard in the traditions and fables of  
a credulous and superstitious age, &mdash; stories handed  
down in the interior settlements, circulated in companies gathered around the hearths of farmhouses,  
indulging the excitements of terrified imaginations;  
filling each other's minds with wondrous tales of  
second-sight, ghosts and spirits from the unseen world,  
together with what the West-Indian or South slaves could add, &mdash; was for a long time the food  
of their fancies. They experimented continually upon  
what was the spiritualism of their day, and grew  
familiar with the imagery and the exhibitions of the  
marvellous. The prevalent notions concerning witchcraft  
<pb n="387" id="vII387"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2400">  
<figDesc>Page 387.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
operations and spectral manifestations came into  
full effect among them. Living in the constant contemplation of such things, their minds became inflamed  
and bewildered; and, at the same time, they grew expert in practising and exhibiting the forms of pretended  
supernaturalism, the conditions of diabolical distraction, and the terrors of demonology. Apparitions rose  
before them, revealing the secrets of the past and of  
the future. They beheld the present spectres of persons then bodily far distant. They declared in language, fits, dreams, or trance, the immediate operations  
upon themselves of the Devil, by the agency of his  
confederates. Their sufferings, while thus under &ldquo;an  
evil hand,&rdquo; were dreadful to behold, and soon drew  
wondering and horror-struck crowds around them.</p>  
<p>At this point, if Mr. Parris, the ministers, and magistrates had done their duty, the mischief might have  
been stopped. The girls ought to have been rebuked  
for their dangerous and forbidden sorceries and divinations, their meetings broken up, and all such tamperings with alleged supernaturalism and spiritualism  
frowned down. Instead of this, the neighboring ministers were summoned to meet at Mr. Parris's house  
to witness the extraordinary doings of the girls, and  
all they did was to indorse, and pray over, them.  
Countenance was thus given to their pretensions, and  
the public confidence in the reality of their statements established. Magistrates from the town, church, leading people, and people of all sorts, flocked  
to witness the awful power of Satan, as displayed in  
<pb n="388" id="vII388"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2401">  
<figDesc>Page 388.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the tortures and contortions of the &ldquo;afflicted children;&rdquo; who became objects of wonder, so far as  
their feats were regarded, and of pity in view of their  
agonies and convulsions.</p>  
<p>The aspect of the evidence rather favors the supposition, that the girls originally had no design of  
accusing, or bringing injury upon, any one. But  
the ministers at Parris's house, physicians and others, began the work of destruction by pronouncing  
the opinion that they were bewitched. This carried  
with it, according to the received doctrine, a conviction that there were witches about; for the Devil  
could not act except through the instrumentality of  
beings in confederacy with him. Immediately, the  
girls were beset by everybody to say who it was that  
bewitched them. Yielding to this pressure, they first  
cried out upon such persons as might have been most  
naturally suggested to them, &mdash; Sarah Good, apparently  
without a regular home, and wandering with her children from house to house for shelter and relief; Sarah  
Osburn, a melancholy, broken-minded, bed-ridden person; and Tituba, a slave, probably of mixed African  
and Indian blood. At the examination of these persons, the girls were first brought before the public,  
and the awful power in their hands revealed to them.  
The success with which they acted their parts; the  
novelty of the scene; the ceremonials of the occasion,  
the magistrates in their imposing dignity and authority, the trappings of the marshal and his officers, the  
forms of proceeding, &mdash; all which they had never seen  
<pb n="389" id="vII389"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2402">  
<figDesc>Page 389.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
before; the notice taken of them; the importance attached to them; invested the affair with a strange  
fascination in their eyes, and awakened a new class  
of sentiments and ideas in their minds. A love  
of distinction and notoriety, and the several passions  
that are gratified by the expression by others of sympathy, wonder, and admiration, were brought into  
play. The fact that all eyes were upon them, with  
the special notice of the magistrates, and the entire  
confidence with which their statements were received,  
flattered and beguiled them. A fearful responsibility had been assumed, and they were irretrievably  
committed to their position. While they adhered to  
that position, their power was irresistible, and they  
were sure of the public sympathy and of being  
cherished by the public favor. If they faltered, they  
would be the objects of universal execration and of the  
severest penalties of law for the wrongs already done  
and the falsehoods already sworn to. There was no  
retracing their steps; and their only safety was in continuing the excitement they had raised. New victims  
were constantly required to prolong the delusion,  
fresh fuel to keep up the conflagration; and they  
went on to cry out upon others. With the exception  
of two of their number, who appear to have indulged  
spite against the families in which they were servants,  
there is no evidence that they were actuated by private  
grievances or by animosities personal to themselves.  
They were ready and sure to wreak vengeance upon  
any who expressed doubts about the truth of their  
<pb n="390" id="vII390"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2403">  
<figDesc>Page 390.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
testimony, or the propriety of the proceedings; but,  
beyond this, they were very indifferent as to whom  
they should accuse. They were willing, as to that  
matter, to follow the suggestions of others, and availed  
themselves of all the gossip and slander and unfriendly  
talk in their families that reached their ears. It was  
found, that a hint, with a little information as to persons, places, and circumstances, conveyed to them by  
those who had resentments and grudges to gratify,  
would be sufficient for the purpose. There is reason  
to fear, that there were some behind them, giving  
direction to the accusations, and managing the frightful machinery, all the way through. The persons who  
were apprehended had, to a considerable extent, been  
obnoxious, and subject to prejudice, in connection  
with quarrels and controversies related in Part I.,  
vol. i. They were &ldquo;Topsfield men,&rdquo; or the opponents of Bayley or of Parris, or more or less connected with some other feuds. As further proof that  
the girls were under the guidance of older heads, it  
is obvious, that there was, in the order of the proceedings, a skilful arrangement of times, sequences,  
and concurrents, that cannot be ascribed to them. No  
novelist or dramatist ever laid his plot deeper, distributed his characters more artistically, or conducted  
more methodically the progress of his story.</p>  
<p>In the mean while, they were becoming every day  
more perfect in the performance of their parts; and  
their imaginative powers, nervous excitability, and  
flexibility and rapidity of muscular action, were kept  
<pb n="391" id="vII391"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2404">  
<figDesc>Page 391.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
under constant stimulus, and attaining a higher  
development. The effect of these things, so long  
continued in connection with the perpetual pretence,  
becoming more or less imbued with the character of  
belief, of their alliance and communion with spiritual  
beings and manifestations, may have unsettled, to some  
extent, their minds. Added to this, a sense of the  
horrid consequences of their actions, accumulating with  
every pang they inflicted, the innocent blood they were  
shedding, and the depths of ruin into which they  
were sinking themselves and others, not only demoralized, but to some extent, perhaps, crazed them. It is  
truly a marvel that their physical constitutions did not  
break down under the exhausting excitements, the  
contortions of frame, the force to which the bodily  
functions were subjected in trances and fits, and the  
strain upon all the vital energies, protracted through  
many months. The wonder, however, would have  
been greater, if the mental and moral balance had  
not thereby been disturbed.</p>  
<p>Perpetual conversance with ideas of supernaturalism; daily and nightly communications, whether in the  
form of conscious imposture or honest delusion, with  
the spiritual world, continued through a great length  
of time, &mdash; as much at least as the exclusive contemplation of any one idea or class of ideas, &mdash; must be allowed to be unsalutary. Whatever keeps the thoughts  
wholly apart from the objects of real and natural life,  
and absorbs them in abstractions, cannot be favorable  
to the soundness of the faculties or the tone of the  
<pb n="392" id="vII392"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2405">  
<figDesc>Page 392.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
mind. This must especially be the effect, if the subjects thus monopolizing the attention partake of the  
marvellous and mysterious. When these things are  
considered, and the external circumstances of the  
occasion, the wild social excitement, the consternation,  
confusion, and horror, that were all crowded and heaped  
up and kept pressing upon the soul without intermission for months, the wonder is, indeed, that not  
only the accusers, prosecutors, and sufferers, but the  
whole people, did not lose their senses. Never was  
the great boon of life, a sound mind in a sound body,  
more liable to be snatched away from all parties. The  
depositions of Ann Putnam, Sr., have a tinge of sadness; &mdash; a melancholy, sickly mania running through  
them. Something of the kind is, perhaps, more or less  
discernible in the depositions of others.</p>  
<p>Let us, then, relieve our common nature from the  
load of the imputation, that, in its normal state, it is  
capable of such inconceivable wickedness, by giving to  
these wretched persons the benefit of the supposition  
that they were more or less deranged. This view  
renders the lesson they present more impressive and  
alarming. Sin in all cases, when considered by a  
mind that surveys the whole field, is itself insanity.  
In the case of these accusers, it was so great as to  
prove, by its very monstrousness, that it had actually  
subverted their nature and overthrown their reason.  
They followed their victims to the gallows, and jeered,  
scoffed, insulted them in their dying hours. Sarah  
Churchill, according to the testimony of Sarah Ingersoll,  
<pb n="393" id="vII393"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2406">  
<figDesc>Page 393.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
on one occasion came to herself, and manifested  
the symptoms of a restored moral consciousness: but  
it was a temporary gleam, a lucid interval; and she  
passed back into darkness, continuing, as before, to  
revel in falsehood, and scatter destruction around her.  
With this single exception, there is not the slightest  
appearance of compunction or reflection among them.  
On the contrary, they seem to have been in a frivolous,  
sportive, gay frame of thought and spirits. There is,  
perhaps, in this view of their conduct and demeanor,  
something to justify the belief that they were really  
demented. The fact that a large amount of skilful  
art and adroit cunning was displayed by them is not  
inconsistent with the supposition that they had become  
partially insane; for such cunning and art are often  
associated with insanity.</p>  
<p>The quick wit and ready expedients of the &ldquo;afflicted  
children&rdquo; are very remarkable. They were prompt  
with answers, if any attempted to cross-examine them,  
extricated themselves most ingeniously if ever brought  
into embarrassment, and eluded all efforts to entrap or  
expose them. Among the papers is a deposition, the  
use of which at the trials is not apparent. It does not  
purport to bear upon any particular case. Joseph  
Hutchinson was a firm-minded man, of strong common  
sense. He could not easily be deceived; and, although he took part in the proceedings at the beginning, soon became opposed to them. It looks as if, by  
close questions put to the child, Abigail Williams, on  
some occasion of his casually meeting her, he had tried  
<pb n="394" id="vII394"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2407">  
<figDesc>Page 394.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to expose the falseness of her accusations, and that he  
was made to put the conversation into the shape of a  
deposition. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Joseph Hutchinson,</hi> aged fiftynine years, do testify as followeth: &ldquo;Abigail Williams, I  
have heard you speak often of a book that has been offered  
to you. She said that there were two books: one was a  
short, thick book; and the other was a long book. I asked  
her what color the book was of. She said the books were  
as red as blood. I asked her if she had seen the books  
opened. She said she had seen it many times. I asked  
her if she did see any writing in the book. She said there  
were many lines written; and, at the end of every line, there  
was a seal. I asked her, who brought the book to her.  
She told me that it was the black man. I asked her who  
the black man was. She told me it was the Devil. I asked  
her if she was not afraid to see the Devil. She said, at the  
first she was, and did go from him; but now she was not  
afraid, but could talk with him as well as she could with me.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>There is an air of ease and confidence in the  
answers of Abigail, which illustrates the promptness  
of invention and assurance of their grounds which the  
girls manifested on all occasions. They were never at  
a loss, and challenged scrutiny. Hutchinson gained  
no advantage, and no one else ever did, in an encounter with them.</p>  
<p>Whatever opinion may be formed of the moral or  
mental condition of the &ldquo;afflicted children,&rdquo; as to  
their sanity and responsibility, there can be no doubt  
that they were great actors. In mere jugglery and  
<pb n="395" id="vII395"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2408">  
<figDesc>Page 395.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
sleight of hand, they bear no mean comparison with  
the workers of wonders, in that line, of our own day.  
Long practice had given them complete control over  
their countenances, intonations of voice, and the entire  
muscular and nervous organization of their bodies; so  
that they could at will, and on the instant, go into fits  
and convulsions, swoon and fall to the floor, put their  
frames into strange contortions, bring the blood to the  
face, and send it back again. They could be deadly  
pale at one moment, at the next flushed; their hands  
would be clenched and held together as with a vice;  
their limbs stiff and rigid or wholly relaxed; their  
teeth would be set; they would go through the paroxysms of choking and strangulation, and gasp for  
breath, bringing froth and blood from the mouth; they  
would utter all sorts of screams in unearthly tones;  
their eyes remain fixed, sometimes bereft of all light  
and expression, cold and stony, and sometimes kindled  
into flames of passion; they would pass into the state  
of somnambulism, without aim or conscious direction  
in their movements, looking at some point, where was  
no apparent object of vision, with a wild, unmeaning  
glare. There are some indications that they had  
acquired the art of ventriloquism; or they so wrought  
upon the imaginations of the beholders, that the sounds  
of the motions and voices of invisible beings were believed to be heard. They would start, tremble, and  
be pallid before apparitions, seen, of course, only by  
themselves; but their acting was so perfect that all  
present thought they saw them too. They would  
<pb n="396" id="vII396"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2409">  
<figDesc>Page 396.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
address and hold colloquy with spectres and ghosts;  
and the responses of the unseen beings would be audible to the fancy of the bewildered crowd. They would  
follow with their eyes the airy visions, so that others  
imagined they also beheld them. This was surely a  
high dramatic achievement. Their representations  
of pain, and every form and all the signs and marks of  
bodily suffering, &mdash; as in the case of Ann Putnam's  
arm, and the indentations of teeth on the flesh in many  
instances, &mdash; utterly deceived everybody; and there  
were men present who could not easily have been imposed upon. The Attorney-general was a barrister fresh  
from Inns of Court in London. Deodat Lawson had  
seen something of the world; so had Joseph Herrick.  
Joseph Hutchinson was a sharp, stern, and sceptical  
observer. John Putnam was a man of great practical  
force and discrimination; so was his brother Nathaniel,  
and others of the village. Besides, there were many  
from Boston and elsewhere competent to detect a trick;  
but none could discover any imposture in the girls.  
Sarah Nurse swore that she saw Goody Bibber cheat in  
the matter of the pins; but Bibber did not belong to the  
village, and was a bungling interloper. The accusing  
girls showed extraordinary skill, ingenuity, and fancy  
in inventing the stories to which they testified, and  
seemed to have been familiar with the imagery which  
belonged to the literature of demonology. This has  
led some to suppose that they must have had access to  
books treating the subject. Our fathers abhorred, with  
a perfect hatred, all theatrical exhibitions. It would  
<pb n="397" id="vII397"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2410">  
<figDesc>Page 397.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
have filled them with horror to propose going to a play.  
But unwittingly, week after week, month in and month  
out, ministers, deacons, brethren, and sisters of the  
church rushed to Nathaniel Ingersoll's, to the village  
and town meeting-houses, and to Thomas Beadle's  
Globe Tavern, and gazed with wonder, awe, and  
admiration upon acting such as has seldom been surpassed on the boards of any theatre, high or low,  
ancient or modern.</p>  
<p>There is another aspect that perplexes and confounds the judgments of all who read the story. It  
is this: As it is at present the universal opinion that  
the whole of this witchcraft transaction was a delusion, having no foundation whatever but in the imaginations and passions; and as it is now certain, that all  
the accused, both the condemned and the pardoned,  
were entirely innocent, &mdash; how can it be explained that  
so many were led to confess themselves guilty? The  
answer to this question is to be found in those general principles which have led the wisest legislators  
and jurists to the conclusion, that, although on their  
face and at first thought, they appear to be the very  
best kind of evidence, yet, maturely considered, confessions made under the hope of a benefit, and sometime even without the impulses of such a hope, are  
to be received with great caution and wariness. Here  
were fifty-five persons, who declared themselves guilty  
of a capital, nay, a diabolical crime, of which we know  
they were innocent. It is probable that the motive  
of self-preservation influenced most of them. An  
<pb n="398" id="vII398"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2411">  
<figDesc>Page 398.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
awful death was in immediate prospect. There was  
no escape from the wiles of the accusers. The delusion had obtained full possession of the people, the  
jury, and the Court. By acknowledging a compact  
with Satan, they could in a moment secure their lives  
and liberty. It was a position which only the firmest  
minds could safely occupy. The principles and the  
prowess of ordinary characters could not withstand  
the temptation and the pressure. They yielded, and  
were saved from an impending and terrible death.</p>  
<p>As these confessions had a decisive effect in precipitating the public mind into the depths of its delusion, gave a fatal power to the accusers, and carried  
the proceedings to the horrible extremities which have  
concentrated upon them the attention of the world,  
they assume an importance in the history of the affair  
that demands a full and thorough exposition. At the  
examination of Ann Foster, at Salem Village, on the  
15th of July, 1692, the following confession was, &ldquo;after  
a while,&rdquo; extorted from her. It was undoubtedly the  
result of the overwhelming effect of the horrors of  
her condition upon a distressed and half-crazed mind.  
It shows the staple materials of which confessions  
were made, and the forms of absurd superstition with  
which the imaginations of people were then filled: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>The Devil appeared to her in the shape of a bird at  
several times, &mdash; such a bird as she never saw the like before;  
and she had had this gift (viz., of striking the afflicted down  
with her eye) ever since. Being asked why she thought  
that bird was the Devil, she answered, because he came  
<pb n="399" id="vII399"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2412">  
<figDesc>Page 399.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
white and vanished away black; and that the Devil told  
her she should have this gift, and that she must believe him,  
and told her she should have prosperity: and she said that  
he had appeared to her three times, and always as a bird,  
and the last time about half a year since, and sat upon  
a table, &mdash; had two legs and great eyes, and that it was the  
second time of his appearance that he promised her prosperity. She further stated, that it was Goody Carrier  
that made her a witch. She told her, that, if she would not  
be a witch, the Devil would tear her to pieces, and carry  
her away, &mdash; at which time she promised to serve the Devil;  
that she was at the meeting of the witches at Salem Village;  
that Goody Carrier came, and told her of the meeting, and  
would have her go: so they got upon sticks, and went said  
journey, and, being there, did see Mr. Burroughs, the minister, who spake to them all; that there were then twenty persons met together; that she tied a knot in a rag,  
and threw it into the fire to hurt Timothy Swan, and that  
she did hurt the rest that complained of her by squeezing  
puppets like them, and so almost choked them; that she  
and Martha Carrier did both ride on a stick or pole when  
they went to the witch-meeting at Salem Village, and that  
the stick broke as they were carried in the air above the  
tops of the trees, and they fell: but she did hang fast about  
the neck of Goody Carrier, and they were presently at the  
village; that she had heard some of the witches say that  
there were three hundred and five in the whole country,  
and that they would ruin that place, the village; that there  
were also present at that meeting two men besides Mr.  
Burroughs, the minister, and one of them had gray hair;  
and that the discourse among the witches at the meeting  
in Salem Village was, that they would afflict there to set  
up the Devil's kingdom.</p></q>  
<pb n="400" id="vII400"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2413">  
<figDesc>Page 400.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>The confession of which the foregoing is the substance appears to have been drawn out at four several  
examinations on different days, during which she was  
induced by the influences around her to make her  
testimony more and more extravagant at each successive examination. Her daughter, Mary Lacy, called  
Goody Lacy, was brought up on the charge of witchcraft at the same time; and, upon finding the mother  
confessing, she saw that her only safety was in confessing also. When confronted, the daughter cried  
out to the mother, &ldquo;We have forsaken Jesus Christ,  
and the Devil hath got hold of us. How shall we  
get clear of this Evil One?&rdquo; She proceeded to say  
that she had accompanied her mother and Goody  
Carrier, all three riding together on the pole, to  
Salem Village. She then made the following statement: &ldquo;About three or four years ago, she saw Mistress  
Bradbury, Goody Howe, and Goody Nurse baptized by  
the old Serpent at Newbury Falls; that he dipped  
their heads in the water, and then said they were his,  
and he had power over them; that there were six baptized at that time, who were some of the chief or higher  
powers, and that there might be near about a hundred in company at that time.&rdquo; It being asked her  
&ldquo;after what manner she went to Newbury Falls,&rdquo; she  
answered, &ldquo;the Devil carried her in his arms.&rdquo;  
She said, that, &ldquo;if she did take a rag, and roll it up  
together, and imagine it to represent such and such  
a person, then that, whatsoever she did to that rag so  
rolled up, the person represented thereby would be  
<pb n="401" id="vII401"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2414">  
<figDesc>Page 401.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in like manner afflicted.&rdquo; Her daughter, also named  
Mary Lacy, followed the example of her mother and  
grandmother, and made confession.</p>  
<p>An examination of the confessions shows, that, when  
accused persons made up their minds to confess, they  
saw, that, to make their safety secure, it was necessary  
to go the whole length of the popular superstition  
and fanaticism. In many instances, they appear to  
have fabricated their stories with much ingenuity and  
tact, making them tally with the statements of the  
accusers, adding points and items that gave an air  
of truthfulness, and falling in with current notions  
and fancies. They were undoubtedly under training  
by the girls, and were provided with the materials  
of their testimony. Their depositions are valuable,  
inasmuch as they enable us to collect about the whole  
of the notions then prevalent on the subject. If, in  
delivering their evidences, any prompting was needed,  
the accusers were at their elbows, and helped them  
along in their stories. If, in any particular, they were  
in danger of contradicting themselves or others, they  
were checked or diverted. In one case, a confessing  
witch was damaging her own testimony, whereupon  
one of the afflicted cried out that she saw the shapes  
or apparitions of other witches interfering with her  
utterance. The witness took the hint, pretended to  
have lost the power of expressing herself, and was  
removed from the stand.</p>  
<p>In some cases, the confessing witches showed great  
adroitness, and knowledge of human nature. When  
<pb n="402" id="vII402"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2415">  
<figDesc>Page 402.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
a leading minister was visiting them in the prison,  
one of them cried out as he passed her cell, calling  
him by name, &ldquo;Oh! I remember a text you preached  
on in England, twenty years since, from these words:  
`You sin will find you out;' for I find it to be true  
in my own case.&rdquo; This skilful compliment, showing  
the power of his preaching making an impression  
which time could not efface, was no doubt flattering  
to the good man, and secured for her his favorable  
influence.</p>  
<p>Justice requires that their own explanation of the  
influences which led them to confess should not be  
withheld.</p>  
<p>The following declaration of six women belonging  
to Andover is accompanied by a paper signed by more  
than fifty of the most respectable inhabitants of that  
town, testifying to their good character, in which it  
is said that &ldquo;by their sober, godly, and exemplary conversation, they have obtained a good report in the  
place, where they have been well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members:&rdquo; &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;We whose names are underwritten, inhabitants of Andover, when as that horrible and tremendous judgment,  
beginning at Salem Village, in the year 1692, by some called  
witchcraft, first breaking forth at Mr. Parris's house, several young persons, being seemingly afflicted, did accuse  
several persons for afflicting them; and many there believing  
it so to be, we being informed, that, if a person was sick,  
the afflicted person could tell what or who was the cause  
of that sickness: John Ballard of Andover, his wife being  
<pb n="403" id="vII403"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2416">  
<figDesc>Page 403.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
sick at the same time, he, either from himself, or by the advice of others, fetched two of the persons called the afflicted  
persons from Salem Village to Andover, which was the beginning of that dreadful calamity that befell us in Andover,  
believing the said accusations to be true, sent for the said  
persons to come together to the meeting-house in Andover,  
the afflicted persons being there. After Mr. Barnard had  
been at prayer, we were blindfolded, and our hands were  
laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their fits, and  
falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as  
they said: and some led us, and laid our hands upon them;  
and then they said they were well, and that we were guilty  
of afflicting them. Whereupon we were all seized as prisoners, by a warrant from the justice of the peace, and forthwith  
carried to Salem; and by reason of that sudden surprisal,  
we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of that crime, we  
were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated and affrighted, even out of our reason; and our  
nearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful  
condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehended there  
was no other way to save our lives, as the case was then  
circumstanced, but by our confessing ourselves to be such  
and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be, they,  
out of tenderness and pity, persuaded us to confess what we  
did confess. And, indeed, that confession that it is said we  
made was no other than what was suggested to us by some  
gentlemen, they telling us that we were witches, and they  
knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it was  
so; and, our understandings, our reason, our faculties almost  
gone, we were not capable of judging of our condition; as  
also the hard measures they used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence, but said any thing, and  
<pb n="404" id="vII404"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2417">  
<figDesc>Page 404.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
every thing which they desired, and most of what we said  
was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Some  
time after, when we were better composed, they telling us  
what we had confessed, we did profess that we were innocent  
and ignorant of such things; and we hearing that Samuel  
Wardwell had renounced his confession, and was quickly  
after condemned and executed, some of us were told we  
were going after Wardwell.</p>

<p>The means employed, and the influences brought to  
bear upon persons accused, were, in many cases, such  
as wholly to overpower them, and to relieve their confessions, to a great extent, of a criminal character.  
They were scarcely responsible moral agents. In the  
month of October, Increase Mather came to Salem, to  
confer with the confessing witches in prison. The  
result of his examinations is preserved in a document  
of which he is supposed to have been the author. The  
following extracts afford some explanation of the whole  
subject: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Goodwife Tyler did say, that, when she was first apprehended, she had no fears upon her, and did think that  
nothing could have made her confess against herself. But  
since, she had found, to her great grief, that she had wronged  
the truth, and falsely accused herself. She said that, when  
she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges rode with  
her; and that, all along the way from Andover to Salem,  
<pb n="405" id="vII405"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2418">  
<figDesc>Page 405.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
her brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch,  
since the afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised  
out of their fits, and urging her to confess herself a witch.  
She as constantly told him that she was no witch, that she  
knew nothing of witchcraft, and begged him not to urge her  
to confess. However, when she came to Salem, she was  
carried to a room, where her brother on one side, and Mr.  
John Emerson on the other side, did tell her that she  
was certainly a witch, and that she saw the Devil before her  
eyes at that time (and, accordingly, the said Emerson would  
attempt with his hand to beat him away from her eyes);  
and they so urged her to confess, that she wished herself in  
any dungeon, rather than be so treated. Mr. Emerson told  
her, once and again, `Well, I see you will not confess!  
Well, I will now leave you; and then you are undone, body  
and soul, for ever.' Her brother urged her to confess, and  
told her that, in so doing, she could not lie: to which she  
answered, `Good brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if  
I confess, and then who shall answer unto God for my lie?'  
He still asserted it, and said that God would not suffer so  
many good men to be in such an error about it, and that she  
would be hanged if she did not confess; and continued so  
long and so violently to urge and press her to confess, that  
she thought, verily, that her life would have gone from her,  
and became so terrified in her mind that she owned, at  
length, almost any thing that they propounded to her; that  
she had wronged her conscience in so doing; she was guilty  
of a great sin in belying of herself, and desired to mourn for  
it so long as she lived. This she said, and a great deal  
more of the like nature; and all with such affection, sorrow,  
relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it exceeds any pen to  
describe and express the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodwife Wilson said that she was in the dark as to  
some things in her confession. Yet she asserted that,  
knowingly, she never had familiarity with the Devil;  
that, knowingly, she never consented to the afflicting of  
any person, &amp;c. However, she said that truly she was in  
the dark as to the matter of her being a witch. And being  
asked how she was in the dark, she replied, that the afflicted  
persons crying out of her as afflicting them made her fearful of herself; and that was all that made her say that she  
was in the dark.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Goodwife Bridges said that she had confessed against  
herself things which were all utterly false; and that she  
was brought to her confession by being told that she certainly was a witch, and so made to believe it, &mdash; though she  
had no other grounds so to believe.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Some explanation of the details which those, prevailed upon to confess, put into their testimony, and  
which seemed, at the time, to establish and demonstrate the truth of their statements, is afforded by  
what Mary Osgood is reported, by Increase Mather, to  
have said to him on this occasion: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Being asked why she prefixed a time, and spake of her  
being baptized, &amp;c., about twelve years since, she replied  
and said, that, when she had owned the thing, they asked  
the time, to which she answered that she knew not the  
time. But, being told that she did know the time, and must  
tell the time, and the like, she considered that about twelve  
years before (when she had her last child) she had a fit of  
sickness, and was melancholy; and so thought that that  
time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and  
accordingly did prefix the said time. Being asked about  
<pb n="407" id="vII407"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2420">  
<figDesc>Page 407.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed that the  
Devil had appeared to her, &amp;c., she replied, that, being told  
that the Devil had appeared to her, and must needs appear  
to her, &amp;c. (she being a witch), she at length did own that  
the Devil had appeared to her; and, being pressed to say in  
what creature's shape he appeared, she at length did say  
that it was in the shape of a cat. Remembering that, some  
time before her being apprehended, as she went out at her  
door, she saw a cat, &amp;c.; not as though she any whit suspected the said cat to be the Devil, in the day of it, but  
because some creature she must mention, and this came  
into her mind at that time.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This poor woman, as well as several others, besides  
Goodwife Tyler, who denied and renounced their confessions, manifested, as Dr. Mather affirms, the utmost  
horror and anguish at the thought that they could  
have been so wicked as to have belied themselves, and  
brought injury upon others by so doing. They &ldquo;bewailed and lamented their accusing of others, about  
whom they never knew any evil&rdquo; in their lives. They  
proved the sincerity of their repentance by abandoning  
and denouncing their confessions, and thus offering  
their lives as a sacrifice to atone for their falsehood.  
They were then awaiting their trial; and there seemed  
no escape from the awful fate which had befallen all  
persons brought to trial before, and who had not  
confessed or had withdrawn their confession. Fortunately for them, the Court did not meet again in 1692;  
and they were acquitted at the regular session, in the  
January following.</p>

</p>  
<p>In one of Calef's tracts, he sums up his views, on  
the subject of the confessions, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Besides the powerful argument of life (and freedom  
from hardships, not only promised, but also performed to all  
that owned their guilt), there are numerous instances of the  
tedious examinations before private persons, many hours  
together; they all that time urging them to confess (and  
taking turns to persuade them), till the accused were wearied out by being forced to stand so long, or for want of  
sleep, &amp;c., and so brought to give assent to what they said;  
they asking them, `Were you at such a witch meeting?' or,  
`Have you signed the Devil's book?' &amp;c. Upon their replying `Yes,' the whole was drawn into form, as their confession.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This accounts for the similarity of construction and  
substance of the confessions generally.</p>  
<p>Calef remarks:&mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;But that which did mightily further such confessions  
was their nearest relations urging them to it. These, seeing no other way of escape for them, thought it the best  
advice that could be given; hence it was, that the husbands  
of some, by counsel, often urging, and utmost earnestness,  
and children upon their knees intreating, have at length  
prevailed with them to say they were guilty.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>One of the most painful things in the whole affair  
was, that the absolute conviction of the guilt of the  
persons accused, pervading the community, took full  
effect upon the minds of many relatives and friends.  
They did not consider it as a matter of the least possible doubt. They therefore looked upon it as wicked  
<pb n="409" id="vII409"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2422">  
<figDesc>Page 409.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
obstinacy not to confess, and, in this sense, an additional and most conclusive evidence of a mind alienated from truth and wholly given over to Satan. This  
turned natural love and previous friendships into resentment, indignation, and abhorrence, which left the  
unhappy prisoners in a condition where only the most  
wonderful clearness of conviction and strength of character could hold them up. And, in many cases where  
they yielded, it was not from unworthy fear, or for  
self-preservation, but because their judgment was overthrown, and their minds in complete subjection and  
prostration.</p>  
<p>There can, indeed, hardly be a doubt, that, in some  
instances, the confessing persons really believed themselves guilty. To explain this, we must look into the  
secret chambers of the human soul; we must read  
the history of the imagination, and consider its power  
over the understanding. We must transport ourselves  
to the dungeon, and think of its dark and awful walls,  
its dreary hours, its tedious loneliness, its heavy and  
benumbing fetters and chains, its scanty fare, and all  
its dismal and painful circumstances. We must reflect upon their influence over a terrified and agitated,  
an injured and broken spirit. We must think of the  
situation of the poor prisoner, cut off from hope;  
hearing from all quarters, and at all times, morning,  
noon, and night, that there is no doubt of his guilt;  
surrounded and overwhelmed by accusations and evidence, gradually but insensibly mingling and confounding the visions and vagaries of his troubled  
<pb n="410" id="vII410"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2423">  
<figDesc>Page 410.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
dreams with the reveries of his waking hours, until  
his reason becomes obscured, his recollections are  
thrown into derangement, his mind loses the power  
of distinguishing between what is perpetually told him  
by others and what belongs to the suggestions of his  
own memory: his imagination at last gains complete  
ascendency over his other faculties, and he believes  
and declares himself guilty of crimes of which he is  
as innocent as the child unborn. The history of the  
transaction we have been considering, affords a clear  
illustration of the truth and reasonableness of this  
explanation.</p>  
<p>The facility with which persons can be persuaded,  
by perpetually assailing them with accusations of the  
truth of a charge, in reality not true, even when  
it is made against themselves, has been frequently  
noticed. Addison, in one of the numbers of his  
&ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; speaks of it in connection with our present subject: &ldquo;When an old woman,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;begins  
to dote, and grow chargeable to a parish, she is generally turned into a witch, and fills the whole country with extravagant fancies, imaginary distempers,  
and terrifying dreams. In the mean time, the poor  
wretch that is the innocent occasion of so many evils  
begins to be frighted at herself, and sometimes confesses secret commerces and familiarities that her  
imagination forms in a delirious old age. This frequently cuts off charity from the greatest objects of  
compassion, and inspires people with a malevolence  
towards those poor, decrepit parts of our species  
<pb n="411" id="vII411"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2424">  
<figDesc>Page 411.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in whom human nature is defaced by infirmity and  
dotage.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>This passage is important, in addition to the bearing  
it has upon the point we have been considering, as  
describing the state of opinion and feeling in England  
twenty years after the folly had been exploded here.  
In another number of the same series of essays, he  
bears evidence, that the superstitions which here came  
to a head in 1692 had long been prevalent in the  
mother-country: &ldquo;Our forefathers looked upon nature  
with more reverence and horror before the world was  
enlightened by learning and philosophy, and loved to  
astonish themselves with the apprehensions of witchcraft, prodigies, charms, and enchantments. There  
was not a village in England that had not a ghost in  
it; the churchyards were all haunted; every large  
common had a circle of fairies belonging to it; and  
there was scarce a shepherd to be met with who had  
not seen a spirit.&rdquo; These fancies still linger in the  
minds of some in the Old World and in the New.</p>  
<p>After allowing for the utmost extent of prevalent  
superstitions, the exaggerations incident to a state  
of general excitement, and the fertile inventive faculties of the accusing girls, there is much in the evidence that cannot easily be accounted for. In other  
cases than that of Westgate, we find the symptoms  
of that bewildered condition of the senses and imagination not at all surprising or unusual in the experience of men staggering home in midnight hours  
from tavern haunts. Disturbed dreams were, it is  
<pb n="412" id="vII412"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2425">  
<figDesc>Page 412.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
not improbable, a fruitful source of delusion. A large  
part of the evidence is susceptible of explanation by  
the supposition, that the witnesses had confounded  
the visions of their sleeping, with the actual observations and occurrences of their waking hours. At the  
trial of Susanna Martin, it was in evidence, that one  
John Kembal had agreed to purchase a puppy from  
the prisoner, but had afterwards fallen back from his  
bargain, and procured a puppy from some other person, and that Martin was heard to say, &ldquo;If I live, I  
will give him puppies enough.&rdquo; The circumstances  
seem to me to render it probable, that the following  
piece of evidence given by Kembal, and to which the  
Court attached great weight, was the result of a nightmare occasioned by his apprehension and dread of the  
fulfilment of the reported threat: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;I, this deponent, coming from his intended house in  
the woods to Edmund Elliot's house where I dwelt, about the  
sunset or presently after; and there did arise a little black  
cloud in the north-west, and a few drops of rain, and the  
wind blew pretty hard. In going between the house of  
John Weed and the meeting-house, this deponent came by  
several stumps of trees by the wayside; and he by impulse  
he can give no reason of, that made him tumble over the  
stumps one after another, though he had his axe upon his  
shoulder which put him in much danger, and made him resolved to avoid the next, but could not.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;And, when he came a little below the meeting-house,  
there did appear a little thing like a puppy, of a darkish  
color. It shot between my legs forward and backward, as  
<pb n="413" id="vII413"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2426">  
<figDesc>Page 413.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
one that were dancing the hay.<note target="v2n7">*</note> And this deponent, being  
free from all fear, used all possible endeavors to cut it with  
his axe, but could not hurt it; and, as he was thus laboring  
with his axe, the puppy gave a little jump from him, and  
seemed to go into the ground.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;In a little further going, there did appear a black puppy,  
somewhat bigger than the first, but as black as a coal to his  
apprehension, which came against him with such violence  
as its quick motions did exceed his motions of his axe, do  
what he could. And it flew at his belly, and away, and  
then at his throat and over his shoulder one way, and go  
off, and up at it again another way; and with such quickness, speed, and violence did it assault him, as if it would  
tear out his throat or his belly. A good while, he was without fear; but, at last, I felt my heart to fail and sink under  
it, that I thought my life was going out. And I recovered  
myself, and gave a start up, and ran to the fence, and calling upon God and naming the name Jesus Christ, and then  
it invisibly away. My meaning is, it ceased at once; but  
this deponent made it not known to anybody, for fretting  
his wife.&rdquo;<note target="v2n8">&dagger;</note></p></q>

<p>We are all exposed to the danger of confounding  
the impressions left by the imagination, when, set free  
from all confinement, it runs wild in dreams, with the  
actual experiences of wakeful faculties in real life. It  
is a topic worthy the consideration of writers on evidence, and of legal tribunals. So also is the effect,  
upon the personal consciousness, of the continued  
<pb n="415" id="vII415"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2428">  
<figDesc>Page 415.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
repetition of the same story, or of hearing it repeated  
by others. Instances are given in books, &mdash; perhaps  
can be recalled by our own individual experience or  
observation, &mdash; in which what was originally a deliberate  
<pb n="416" id="vII416"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2429">  
<figDesc>Page 416.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
fabrication of falsehood or of fancy has come,  
at last, to be regarded as a veritable truth and a real  
occurrence.</p>  
<p>A thorough and philosophical treatise on the subject of evidence is, in view of these considerations,  
much needed. The liability all men are under to  
confound the fictions of their imaginations with the  
realities of actual observation is not understood with  
sufficient clearness by the community; and, so long as  
it is not understood and regarded, serious mistakes  
and inconveniences will be apt to occur in seasons  
of general excitement. We are still disposed to attribute more importance than we ought to strong  
convictions, without stopping to inquire whether they  
may not be in reality delusions of the understanding.  
The cause of truth demands a more thorough examination of this whole subject. The visions that appeared before the mind of the celebrated Colonel  
Gardiner are still regarded by the generality of pious  
people as evidence of miraculous interposition, while,  
just so far as they are evidence to that point, so far  
is the authority of Christianity overthrown; for it is a  
fact, that Lord Herbert of Cherbury believed with equal  
sincerity and confidence that he had been vouchsafed  
a similar vision sanctioning his labors, when about  
to publish what has been pronounced one of the most  
powerful attacks ever made upon our religion. It is  
dangerous to advance arguments in favor of any cause  
which may be founded upon nothing better than the  
reveries of an ardent imagination!</p>

</p>  
<p>The phenomena of dreams, of the exercises and  
convictions which occupy the mind, while the avenues  
of the senses are closed, and the soul is more or less  
extricated from its connection with the body, particularly in the peculiar conditions of partial slumber, are  
among the deep mysteries of human experience. The  
writers on mental philosophy have not given them  
the attention they deserve.</p>  
<p>The testimony in these trials is particularly valuable as showing the power of the imagination to completely deceive and utterly falsify the senses of sober  
persons, when wide awake and in broad daylight.  
The following deposition was given in Court under  
oath. The parties testifying were of unquestionable  
respectability. The man was probably a brother of  
James Bayley, the first minister of the Salem Village  
parish.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Joseph Bayley,</hi> aged forty-four  
years. &mdash; Testifieth and saith, that, on the twenty-fifth day  
of May last, myself and my wife being bound to Boston,  
on the road, when I came in sight of the house where John  
Procter did live, there was a very hard blow struck on my  
breast, which caused great pain in my stomach and amazement in my head, but did see no person near me, only my  
wife behind me on the same horse; and, when I came  
against said Procter's house, according to my understanding,  
I did see John Procter and his wife at said house. Procter  
himself looked out of the window, and his wife did stand  
just without the door. I told my wife of it; and she did  
look that way, and could see nothing but a little maid at  
<pb n="418" id="vII418"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2431">  
<figDesc>Page 418.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the door. Afterwards, about half a mile from the aforesaid  
house, I was taken spechless for some short time. My  
wife did ask me several questions, and desired me, that,  
if I could not speak, I should hold up my hand; which I  
did, and immediately I could speak as well as ever. And,  
when we came to the way where Salem road cometh into  
Ipswich road, there I received another blow on my breast,  
which caused so much pain that I could not sit on my horse.  
And, when I did alight off my horse, to my understanding,  
I saw a woman coming towards us about sixteen or twenty  
pole from us, but did not know who it was: my wife could  
not see her. When I did get up on my horse again, to my  
understanding, there stood a cow where I saw the woman.  
After that, we went to Boston without any further molestation; but, after I came home again to Newbury, I was  
pinched and nipped by something invisible for some time:  
but now, through God's goodness to me, I am well again. &mdash;  
<hi rend="italics">Jurat in curia</hi> by both persons.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Bayley and his wife were going to Boston on election week. It was a good two days' journey from  
Newbury, as the roads then were, and riding as they  
did. According to the custom of the times, she was  
mounted on a pillion behind him. They had probably  
passed the night at the house of Sergeant Thomas  
Putnam, with whom he was connected by marriage.  
It was at the height of the witchcraft delirium.  
Thomas Putnam's house was the very focus of it.  
There they had listened to highly wrought accounts  
of its wonders and terrors, had witnessed the amazing  
phenomena exhibited by Ann Putnam and Mercy  
Lewis, and their minds been filled with images of  
<pb n="419" id="vII419"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2432">  
<figDesc>Page 419.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
spectres of living witches, and ghosts of the dead.  
They had seen with their own eyes the tortures of  
the girls under cruel diabolical influence, of which  
they had heard so much, and realized the dread outbreak of Satan and his agents upon the lives and  
souls of men.</p>  
<p>They started the next morning on their way through  
the gloomy woods and over the solitary road. It was  
known that they were to pass the house of John  
Procter, believed to be a chief resort of devilish spirits.  
Oppressed with terror and awe, Bayley was on the  
watch, his heart in his mouth. The moment he came  
in sight, his nervous agitation reached its climax;  
and he experienced the shock he describes. When  
he came opposite to the house, to his horror there  
was Procter looking at him from the window, and  
Procter's wife standing outside of the door. He knew,  
that, in their proper persons and natural bodies, they  
were, at that moment, both of them, and had been  
for six weeks, in irons, in one of the cells of the jail  
at Boston. Bayley's wife, from her position on the  
pillion behind him, had her face directed to the other  
side of the road. He told her what he saw. She  
looked round to the house, and could see nothing but  
a little maid at the door. After one or two more  
fits of fright, he reached the Lynn road, had escaped  
from the infernal terrors of the infected region, and his  
senses resumed their natural functions. It was several days before his nervous agitations ceased. Altogether, this is a remarkable case of hallucination:  
<pb n="420" id="vII420"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2433">  
<figDesc>Page 420.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
showing that the wildest fancies brought before the  
mind in dreams may be paralleled in waking hours;  
and that mental excitement may, even then, close the  
avenues of the senses, exclude the perception of reality, and substitute unsubstantial visions in the place  
of actual and natural objects.</p>  
<p>There may be an interest in some minds to know  
who the &ldquo;little maid at the door&rdquo; was. The elder  
children of John Procter were either married off, or  
lived on his farm at Ipswich, with the exception of  
Benjamin, his oldest son, who remained with his father  
on the Salem farm. Benjamin had been imprisoned  
two days before Bayley passed the house. Four days  
before, Sarah, sixteen years of age, had also been  
arrested, and committed to jail. This left only William, eighteen years of age, who, three days after, was  
himself put into prison; Samuel, seven; Abigail, between three and four years of age; and one still  
younger. No female of the family was then at the  
house older than Abigail. This poor deserted child  
was &ldquo;the little maid.&rdquo; Curiosity to see the passing  
strangers, or possibly the hope that they might be her  
father and mother, or her brother and sister, brought  
her to the door.</p>  
<p>In the terrible consequences that resulted from the  
mischievous, and perhaps at the outset merely sportive, proceedings of the children in Mr. Parris's family,  
we have a striking illustration of the principle, that  
no one can foretell, with respect either to himself or  
others, the extent of the suffering and injury that may  
<pb n="421" id="vII421"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2434">  
<figDesc>Page 421.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
be occasioned by the least departure from truth, or  
from the practice of deception. In the horrible succession of crimes through which those young persons  
were led to pass, in the depth of depravity to which  
they were thrown, we discern the fate that endangers  
all who enter upon a career of wickedness.</p>  
<p>No one can have an adequate knowledge of the  
human mind, who has not contemplated its developments in scenes like those that have now been related.  
It may be said of the frame of our spiritual, even with  
more emphasis than of our corporeal nature, that we  
are fearfully and wonderfully made. In the maturity  
of his bodily and mental organization, health gliding  
through his veins, strength and symmetry clothing his  
form, intelligence beaming from his countenance, and  
immortality stamped on his brow, man is indeed the  
noblest work of God. In the degradation and corruption to which he can descend, he is the most  
odious and loathsome object in the creation. The  
human mind, when all its faculties are fully developed and in proper proportions, reason seated on  
its rightful throne and shedding abroad its light,  
memory embracing the past, hope smiling upon the  
future, faith leaning on Heaven, and the affections  
diffusing through all their gentle warmth, is worthy  
of its source, deserves its original title of &ldquo;image of  
God,&rdquo; and is greater and better than the whole material universe. It is nobler than all the works of  
God; for it is an emanation, a part of God himself,  
&ldquo;a ray from the fountain of light.&rdquo; But where, I  
<pb n="422" id="vII422"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2435">  
<figDesc>Page 422.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
ask, can you find a more deplorable and miserable  
object than the mind in ruins, tossed by its own rebellious principles, and distorted by the monstrously  
unequal development of its faculties? You will look  
in vain upon the earthquake, the volcano, or the hurricane, for those elements of the awful and terrible  
which are manifested in a community of men whose  
passions have trampled upon their principles, whose  
imaginations have overthrown the government of reason, and who are swept along by the torrent until all  
order and security are swallowed up and lost. Such  
a spectacle we have now been witnessing. We have  
seen the whole population of this place and vicinity  
yielding to the sway of their credulous fancies, allowing their passions to be worked up to a tremendous  
pitch of excitement, and rushing into excesses of  
folly and violence that have left a stain on their  
memory, and will awaken a sense of shame, pity, and  
amazement in the minds of their latest posterity.</p>  
<p>There is nothing more mysterious than the selfdeluding power of the mind, and there never were  
scenes in which it was more clearly displayed than  
the witchcraft prosecutions. Honest men testified,  
with perfect confidence and sincerity, to the most absurd impossibilities; while those who thought themselves victims of diabolical influence would actually  
exhibit, in their corporeal frames, all the appropriate  
symptoms of the sufferings their imaginations had  
brought upon them. Great ignorance prevailed in  
reference to the influences of the body and the mind  
<pb n="423" id="vII423"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2436">  
<figDesc>Page 423.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
upon each other. While the imagination was called  
into a more extensive and energetic action than at  
any succeeding or previous period, its properties  
and laws were but little understood: the extent of  
the connection of the will and the muscular system,  
the reciprocal influence of the nerves and the fancy,  
and the strong and universally pervading sympathy  
between our physical and moral constitutions, were  
almost wholly unknown. These important subjects,  
indeed, are but imperfectly understood at the present  
day.</p>  
<p>It may perhaps be affirmed, that the relations of  
the human mind with the spiritual world will never  
be understood while we continue in the present stage  
of existence and mode of being. The error of our  
ancestors &mdash; and it is an error into which men have  
always been prone to fall, and from which our own  
times are by no means exempt &mdash; was in imagining  
that their knowledge had extended, in this direction,  
beyond the boundary fixed unalterably to our researches, while in this corporeal life.</p>  
<p>It admits of much question, whether human science  
can ever find a solid foundation in what relates to the  
world of spirits. The only instrument of knowledge  
we can here employ is language. Careful thinkers  
long ago came to the conclusion, that it is impossible  
to frame a language precisely and exclusively adapted  
to convey abstract and spiritual ideas, even if it is  
possible, as some philosophers have denied, for the  
mind, in its present state, to have such ideas. All  
<pb n="424" id="vII424"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2437">  
<figDesc>Page 424.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
attempts to construct such a language, though made  
by the most ingenious men, have failed. Language  
is based upon imagery, and associations drawn from  
so much of the world as the senses disclose to us;  
that is, from material objects and their relations. We  
are here confined, as it were, within narrow walls.  
We can catch only glimpses of what is above and  
around us, outside of those walls. Such glimpses  
may be vouchsafed, from time to time, to rescue us  
from sinking into materialism, and to keep alive our  
faith in scenes of existence remaining to be revealed  
when the barriers of our imprisonment shall be taken  
down, and what we call death lift us to a clearer and  
broader vision of universal being.</p>  
<p>Of the reality of the spiritual world, we are assured  
by consciousness and by faith; but our knowledge of  
that world, so far as it can go into particulars, or become the subject of definition or expression, extends  
no further than revelation opens the way. In all ages,  
men have been awakened to the &ldquo;wonders of the invisible world;&rdquo; but they remain &ldquo;wonders&rdquo; still.  
Nothing like a permanent, stable, or distinct science  
has ever been achieved in this department. Man and  
God are all that are placed within our ken. Metaphysics and Theology are the names given to the sciences  
that relate to them. The greater the number of books  
written by human learning and ingenuity to expound  
them, the more advanced the intelligence and piety of  
mankind, the less, it is confessed, do we know of them  
in detail, the more they rise above our comprehension,  
<pb n="425" id="vII425"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2438">  
<figDesc>Page 425.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the more unfathomable become their depths. Experience, history, the progress of light, all increase our  
sense of the impossibility of estimating the capacities  
of the human soul. So also we find that the higher  
we rise towards the Deity, in the contemplation of his  
works and word, the more does he continue to transcend our power to describe or imagine his greatness  
and glory. The revelation which the Saviour brought  
to mankind is all that the heart of man need desire  
or the mind of man can comprehend. We are God's  
children, and he is our Father. That is all; and, the  
wiser and better we become, the more we are convinced and satisfied that it is enough.</p>  
<p>There are, undoubtedly, innumerable beings in the  
world of spirits, besides departed souls, the Redeemer  
and the Father. But of such beings we have, while  
here, no absolute and specific knowledge. In every  
age, as well as in our own, there have been persons  
who have believed themselves to hold communication with unseen spirits. The methods of entering  
into such communication have been infinitely diversified, from the incantations of ancient sorcery to the  
mediums and rappings of the present day. In former  
periods, particularly where the belief of witchcraft  
prevailed, it was thought that such communications  
could be had only with evil spirits, and, mostly, with  
the Chief of evil spirits. They were accordingly treated  
as criminal, and made the subject of the severest penalties known to the law. In our day, no such penalties  
are attached to the practice of seeking spiritual communications.  
<pb n="426" id="vII426"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2439">  
<figDesc>Page 426.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Those who have a fancy for such experiments are allowed to amuse themselves in this way  
without reproach or molestation. It is not charged  
upon them that they are dealing with the Evil One or  
any of his subordinates. They do not imagine such a  
thing themselves. I have no disposition, at any time,  
in any given case, to dispute the reality of the wonderful stories told in reference to such matters. All that  
I am prompted ever to remark is, that, if spirits do  
come, as is believed, at the call of those who seek to put  
themselves into communication with them, there is no  
evidence, I venture to suggest, that they are good  
spirits. I have never heard of their doing much  
good, substantially, to any one. No important truth  
has been revealed by them, no discovery been made,  
no science had its field enlarged; no department of  
knowledge has been brought into a clearer light; no  
great interest has been promoted; no movement of  
human affairs, whether in the action of nations or the  
transactions of men, has been advanced or in any way  
facilitated; no impulse has been given to society, and  
no elevation to life and character. It may be that the  
air is full of spiritual beings, hovering about us; but  
all experience shows that no benefit can be derived  
from seeking their intervention to share with us the  
duties or the burdens of our present probation. The  
mischiefs which have flowed from the belief that they  
can operate upon human affairs, and from attempting  
to have dealings with them, have been illustrated in  
the course of our narrative. In this view of the subject,  
<pb n="427" id="vII427"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2440">  
<figDesc>Page 427.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
no law is needed to prevent real or pretended  
communication with invisible beings. Enlightened reflection, common sense, natural prudence, would seem  
to be sufficient to keep men from meddling at all with  
practices, or countenancing notions, from which all  
history proclaims that no good has ever come, but  
incalculable evil flowed.</p>  
<p>For the conduct of life, while here in these bodies,  
we must confine our curiosity to fields of knowledge  
open to our natural and ordinary faculties, and embraced within the limits of the established condition  
of things. Our fathers filled their fancies with the  
visionary images of ghosts, demons, apparitions, and  
all other supposed forms and shadows of the invisible  
world; lent their ears to marvellous stories of communications with spirits; gave to supernatural tales  
of witchcraft and demonology a wondering credence,  
and allowed them to occupy their conversation, speculations, and reveries. They carried a belief of such  
things, and a proneness to indulge it, into their daily  
life, their literature, and the proceedings of tribunals,  
ecclesiastical and civil. The fearful results shrouded  
their annals in darkness and shame. Let those results for ever stand conspicuous, beacon-monuments  
warning us, and coming generations, against superstition in every form, and all credulous and vain  
attempts to penetrate beyond the legitimate boundaries of human knowledge.</p>  
<p>The phenomena of the real world, so far as science  
discloses them to our contemplation; the records of  
<pb n="428" id="vII428"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2441">  
<figDesc>Page 428.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
actual history; the lessons of our own experience; the  
utterances of the voice within, audible only to ourselves; and the teachings of the Divine Word, &mdash; are  
sufficient for the exercise of our faculties and the  
education of our souls during this brief period of  
our being, while in these bodies. In God's appointed  
time, we shall be transferred to a higher level of vision.  
Then, but not before, we may hope for re-union with  
disembodied spirits, for intercourse with angels, and  
for a nearer and more open communion with all divine  
beings.</p>  
<p>The principal difference in the methods by which  
communications were believed to be made between  
mortals and spiritual beings, at the time of the witchcraft delusion and now, is this. Then it was chiefly  
by the medium of the eye, but at present by the ear.  
The &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; professed to have seen and  
conversed with the ghosts of George Burroughs's former  
wives and of others. They also professed to have seen  
the shapes or appearances of living persons in a disembodied form, or in the likeness of some animal or  
creature. Now it is affirmed by those calling themselves Spiritualists, that, by certain rappings or other  
incantations, they can summon into immediate but  
invisible presence the spirits of the departed, hold  
conferences with them, and draw from them information not derivable from any sources of human  
knowledge. There is no essential distinction between  
the old and the new belief and practice. The consequences that resulted from the former would be  
<pb n="429" id="vII429"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2442">  
<figDesc>Page 429.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
likely to result from the latter, if it should obtain  
universal or general credence, be allowed to mix with  
judicial proceedings, or to any extent affect the rights  
of person, property, or character.</p>  
<p>The &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; at Salem Village had, by  
long practice, become wonderful adepts in the art of  
jugglery, and probably of ventriloquism. They did  
many extraordinary things, and were believed to have  
constant communications with ghosts and spectres;  
but they did not attain to spiritual rapping. If they  
had possessed that power, the credulity of judges, ministers, magistrates, and people, would have been utterly  
overwhelmed, and no limit could have been put to the  
destruction they might have wrought.</p>  
<p>If there was any thing supernatural in the witchcraft of 1692, if any other than human spirits were  
concerned at all, one thing is beyond a doubt: they  
were shockingly wicked spirits, and led those who  
dealt with them to the utmost delusion, crime, and  
perdition; and this example teaches all who seek to  
consult with spirits, through a medium or in any  
other way, to be very strict to require beforehand  
the most satisfactory and conclusive evidence of good  
character before they put themselves into communication with them. Spirits who are said to converse  
with people, in these modern ages, cannot be considered as having much claim to a good repute. No  
valuable discovery of truth, no important guidance  
in human conduct, no useful instruction, has ever  
been conveyed to mankind through them; and much  
<pb n="430" id="vII430"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2443">  
<figDesc>Page 430.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
mischief perhaps may have resulted from confiding  
in them. It is not wise to place our minds under  
the influence of any of our fellow-creatures, in the ordinary guise of humanity, unless we know something  
about them entitling them to our acquaintance; much  
less so, to take them into our intimacy or confidence.  
Spirits cannot be put under oath, or their credibility  
be subjected to tests. Whether they are spirits of  
truth or falsehood cannot be known; and common  
caution would seem to dictate an avoidance of their  
company. The fields of knowledge opened to us in  
the works of mortal men; the stores of human learning and science; the pages of history, sacred or profane; the records of revelation; and the instructions  
and conversation of the wise and good of our fellow, while in the body, &mdash; are wide enough for our  
exploration, and may well occupy the longest lifetime.</p>  
<p>In its general outlines and minuter details, Salem  
Witchcraft is an illustration of the fatal effects of  
allowing the imagination inflamed by passion to take  
the place of common sense, and of pushing the curiosity and credence of the human mind, in this stage  
of our being, while in these corporeal embodiments,  
beyond the boundaries that ought to limit their exercise. If we disregard those boundaries, and try to  
overleap them, we shall be liable to the same results.  
The lesson needs to be impressed equally upon all  
generations and ages of the world's future history.  
Essays have been written and books published to  
prove that the sense of the miraculous is destined  
<pb n="431" id="vII431"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2444">  
<figDesc>Page 431.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to decline as mankind becomes more enlightened, and  
ascribing a greater or less tendency to the indulgence  
of this sense to particular periods of the church, or  
systems of belief, or schools of what is called philosophy. It is maintained that it was more prevalent  
in the medi&aelig;val ages than in modern times. Some  
assert that it has had a greater development in Catholic  
than Protestant countries; and some, perhaps, insist  
upon the reverse. Some attempt to show that it has  
manifested itself more remarkably among Puritans  
than in other classes of Protestant Christians. The  
last and most pretentious form of this dogma is, that  
the sense of the miraculous fades away in the progress of what arrogates to itself the name of Rationalism. This is one of the delusive results of introducing  
generalization into historical disquisitions. History  
deals with man. Man is always the same. The race  
consists, not of an aggregation, but of individuals, in  
all ages, never moulded or melted into classes. Each  
individual has ever retained his distinctness from every  
other. There has been the same infinite variety in  
every period, in every race, in every nation. Society,  
philosophy, custom, can no more obliterate these varieties than they can bring the countenances and features  
of men into uniformity. Diversity everywhere alike  
prevails. The particular forms and shapes in which  
the sense of the miraculous may express itself have  
passed and will pass away in the progress of civilization. But the sense itself remains; just as particular  
costumes and fashions of garment pass away, while the  
<pb n="432" id="vII432"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2445">  
<figDesc>Page 432.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
human form, its front erect and its vision towards  
the heavens, remains. The sense of the miraculous  
remains with Protestants as much as with Catholics,  
with Churchmen as much as with Puritans, with those  
who reject all creeds, equally with those whose creeds  
are the longest and the oldest. In our day, it must  
have been generally noticed, that the wonders of what  
imagines itself to be Spiritualism are rather more  
accredited by persons who aspire to the character of  
rationalists than by those who hold on tenaciously  
to the old landmarks of Orthodoxy.</p>  
<p>The truth is, that the sense of the miraculous has  
not declined, and never can. It will grow deeper  
and stronger with the progress of true intelligence.  
As long as man thinks, he will feel that he is himself a perpetual miracle. The more he thinks, the  
more will he feel it. The mind which can wander into  
the deepest depths of the starry heavens, and feel  
itself to be there; which, pondering over the printed  
page, lives in the most distant past, communes with  
sages of hoar antiquity, with prophets and apostles,  
joins the disciples as they walk with the risen Lord  
to Emmaus, or mingles in the throng that listen to  
Paul at Mars' Hill, &mdash; knows itself to be beyond the  
power of space or time, and greater than material  
things. It knows not what it shall be; but it feels  
that it is something above the present and visible.  
It realizes the spiritual world, and will do so more  
and more, the higher its culture, the greater its freedom, and the wider its view of the material nature  
<pb n="433" id="vII433"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2446">  
<figDesc>Page 433.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
by which it is environed, while in this transitory stage  
of its history.</p>  
<p>The lesson of our story will be found not to discard  
spiritual things, but to teach us, while in the flesh,  
not to attempt to break through present limitations, not  
to seek to know more than has been made known of  
the unseen and invisible, but to keep the inquiries  
of our minds and the action of society within the  
bounds of knowledge now attainable, and extend our  
curious researches and speculations only as far as  
we can here have solid ground to stand upon.</p>  
<p>To explain the superstitious opinions that took effect  
in the witchcraft delusion, it is necessary to consider  
the state of biblical criticism at that period. That  
department of theological learning was then in a very  
immature condition.</p>  
<p>The authority of Scripture, as it appeared on the  
face of the standard version, seemed to require them  
to pursue the course they adopted; and those enlarged  
and just principles of interpretation which we are  
taught by the learned of all denominations at the present day to apply to the Sacred Writings had not then  
been brought to the view of the people or received  
by the clergy.</p>  
<p>It was gravely argued, for instance, that there was  
nothing improbable in the idea that witches had the  
power, in virtue of their compact with the Devil, of  
riding aloft through the air, because it is recorded, in  
the history of our Lord's temptation, that Satan transported him in a similar manner to the pinnacle of the  
<pb n="434" id="vII434"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2447">  
<figDesc>Page 434.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
temple, and to the summit of an exceedingly high  
mountain. And Cotton Mather declares, that, to his  
apprehension, the disclosures of the wonderful operations of the Devil, upon and through his subjects, that  
were made in the course of the witchcraft prosecutions, had shed a marvellous light upon the Scriptures!  
What a perversion of the Sacred Writings to employ  
them for the purpose of sanctioning the extravagant  
and delirious reveries of the human imagination!  
What a miserable delusion, to suppose that the Word  
of God could receive illumination from the most absurd and horrible superstition that ever brooded in  
darkness over the mind of man!</p>  
<p>One of the sources of the delusion of 1692 was  
ignorance of many natural laws that have been revealed by modern science. A vast amount of knowledge on these subjects has been attained since that  
time. In our halls of education, in associations for  
the diffusion of knowledge, and in a diversified and  
all-pervading popular literature, what was dark and  
impenetrable mystery then has been explained, accounted for, and brought within the grasp of all minds.  
The contemplation of the evils brought upon our  
predecessors by their ignorance of the laws of nature  
cannot but lead us to appreciate more highly our  
opportunities to get knowledge in this department:  
As we advance into the interior of the physical system  
to which we belong; are led in succession from one  
revelation of beauty and grandeur to another, and the  
field of light and truth displaces that of darkness and  
<pb n="435" id="vII435"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2448">  
<figDesc>Page 435.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
mystery; while the fearful images that disturbed the  
faith and bewildered the thoughts of our fathers are  
dissolving and vanishing, the whole host of spirits,  
ghosts, and demons disappearing, and the presence  
and providence of God alone found to fill all scenes and  
cause all effects, &mdash; our hearts ought to rise to him in  
loftier adoration and holier devotion. If, while we  
enjoy a fuller revelation of his infinite and all-glorious  
operations and designs than our fathers did, the sentiment of piety which glowed in their hearts like a coal  
from the altar of God has been permitted to grow dim  
in ours, no reproach their errors and faults can possibly authorize will equal that which will justly fall  
upon us.</p>  
<p>Another cause of their delusion was too great a  
dependence upon the imagination. We shall find no  
lesson more clearly taught by history, by experience,  
or by observation, than this, that man is never safe  
while either his fancy or his feeling is the guiding  
principle of his nature. There is a strong and constant attraction between his imagination and his passions; and, if either is permitted to exercise unlimited  
sway, the other will most certainly be drawn into co with it, and, when they are allowed to act  
without restraint upon each other and with each other,  
they lead to the derangement and convulsion of his  
whole system. They constitute the combustible elements of our being: one serves as the spark to explode  
the other. Reason, enlightened by revelation and  
guided by conscience, is the great conservative principle:  
<pb n="436" id="vII436"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2449">  
<figDesc>Page 436.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
while that exercises the sovereign power over  
the fancy and the passions, we are safe; if it is dethroned, no limit can be assigned to the ruin that may  
follow. In the scenes we have now been called to  
witness, we have perceived to what lengths of folly,  
cruelty, and crime even good men have been carried,  
who relinquished the aid, rejected the counsels, and  
abandoned the guidance of their reason.</p>  
<p>Another influence that operated to produce the catastrophe in 1692 was the power of contagious sympathy.  
Every wise man and good citizen ought to be aware of  
the existence and operation of this power. There  
seems indeed to be a constitutional, original, sympathy  
in our nature. When men act in a crowd, their heartstrings are prone to vibrate in unison. Whatever  
chord of passion is struck in one breast, the same will  
ring forth its wild note through the whole mass. This  
principle shows itself particularly in seasons of excitement, and its power rises in proportion to the ardor  
and zeal of those upon whom it acts. It is for every  
one who desires to be preserved from the excesses of  
popular feeling, and to prevent the community to which  
he belongs from plunging into riotous and blind commotions, to keep his own judgment and emotions as  
free as possible from a power that seizes all it can  
reach, draws them into its current, and sweeps them  
round and round like the Maelstrom, until they are  
overwhelmed and buried in its devouring vortex.  
When others are heated, the only wisdom is to determine to keep cool; whenever a people or an individual  
<pb n="437" id="vII437"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2450">  
<figDesc>Page 437.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
is rushing headlong, it is the duty of patriotism and of  
friendship to check the motion.</p>  
<p>In this connection it may be remarked &mdash; and I should  
be sorry to bring the subject to a close without urging  
the thought upon your attention &mdash; that the mere power  
of sympathy, the momentum with which men act in a  
crowd, is itself capable of convulsing society and  
overthrowing all its safeguards, without the aid or  
supposed agency of supernatural beings. The early  
history of the colony of New York presents a case  
in point.</p>  
<p>In 1741, just half a century after the witchcraft  
prosecutions in Massachusetts, the city of New York,  
then containing about nine thousand inhabitants, witnessed a scene quite rivalling, in horror and folly, that  
presented here. Some one started the idea, that a conspiracy was on foot, among the colored portion of the  
inhabitants, to murder the whites. The story was  
passed from one to another. Although subsequently  
ascertained to have been utterly without foundation,  
no one stopped to inquire into its truth, or had the  
wisdom or courage to discountenance its circulation.  
Soon a universal panic, like a conflagration, spread  
through the whole community; and the results were  
most frightful. More than one hundred persons were  
cast into prison. Four white persons and eighteen  
negroes were hanged. Eleven negroes were burned  
at the stake, and fifty were transported into slavery.  
As in the witchcraft prosecutions, a clergyman was  
among the victims, and perished on the gallows.</p>  
<pb n="438" id="vII438"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2451">  
<figDesc>Page 438.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>The &ldquo;New-York Negro Plot,&rdquo; as it was called,  
was indeed marked by all the features of absurdity in  
the delusion, ferocity in the popular excitement, and  
destruction along the path of its progress, which belonged to the witchcraft proceedings here, and shows  
that any people, given over to the power of contagious  
passion, may be swept by desolation, and plunged into  
ruin.</p>  
<p>One of the practical lessons inculcated by the history that has now been related is, that no duty is  
more certain, none more important, than a free and  
fearless expression of opinion, by all persons, on all  
occasions. No wise or philosophic person would think  
of complaining of the diversities of sentiment it is likely to develop. Such diversities are the vital principle of  
free communities, and the only elements of popular  
intelligence. If the right to utter them is asserted by  
all and for all, tolerance is secured, and no inconvenience results. It is probable that there were many  
persons here in 1692 who doubted the propriety of  
the proceedings at their commencement, but who were  
afterwards prevailed upon to fall into the current and  
swell the tide. If they had all discharged their duty  
to their country and their consciences by freely and  
boldly uttering their disapprobation and declaring their  
dissent, who can tell but that the whole tragedy might  
have been prevented? and, if it might, the blood of the  
innocent may be said, in one sense, to be upon their  
heads.</p>  
<p>The leading features and most striking aspects of  
<pb n="439" id="vII439"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2452">  
<figDesc>Page 439.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the witchcraft delusion have been repeated in places  
where witches and the interference of supernatural  
beings are never thought of: whenever a community  
gives way to its passions, and spurns the admonitions  
and casts off the restraints of reason, there is a delusion that can hardly be described in any other phrase.  
We cannot glance our eye over the face of our country  
without beholding such scenes: and, so long as they  
are exhibited; so long as we permit ourselves to invest  
objects of little or no real importance with such an  
inordinate imaginary interest that we are ready to go  
to every extremity rather than relinquish them; so  
long as we yield to the impulse of passion, and plunge  
into excitement, and take counsel of our feelings rather  
than our judgment, &mdash; we are following in the footsteps  
of our fanatical ancestors. It would be wiser to direct  
our ridicule and reproaches to the delusions of our  
own times than to those of a previous age; and it  
becomes us to treat with charity and mercy the failings of our predecessors, at least until we have ceased  
to imitate and repeat them.</p>  
<p>It has been my object to collect and arrange all the  
materials within reach necessary to give a correct and  
adequate view of the passage of history related and  
discussed in this work, and to suggest the considerations and conclusions required by truth and justice.  
It is worthy of the most thoughtful contemplation.  
The moralist, metaphysician, and political philosopher  
will find few chapters of human experience more  
fraught with instruction, and may well ponder upon  
<pb n="440" id="vII440"/>

<figDesc>Page 440.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the lessons it teaches, scrutinize thoroughly all its  
periods, phases, and branches, analyze its causes, eliminate its elements, and mark its developments. The  
laws, energies, capabilities, and liabilities of our nature, as exhibited in the character of individuals and  
in the action of society, are remarkably illustrated.  
The essential facts belonging to the transaction, gathered from authentic records and reliable testimonies  
and traditions, have been faithfully presented. <hi rend="smallcaps">The  
Witchcraft Delusion of</hi> 1692, so far as I have been  
able to recover it from misunderstanding and oblivion,  
has been brought to view; and I indulge the belief,  
that the subject will commend itself to, and reward,  
the study of every meditative mind.</p>  
<p>I know not in what better terms the discussion of  
this subject can be brought to a termination, than in  
those which express the conclusions to which one of  
our own most distinguished citizens was brought, after  
having examined the whole transaction with the eye of  
a lawyer and the spirit of a judge. The following is  
from the Centennial Discourse pronounced in Salem  
on the 18th of September, 1828, by the late Hon.  
Joseph Story, of the Supreme Court of the United  
States: &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;We may lament, then,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the errors of  
the times, which led to these prosecutions. But surely  
our ancestors had no special reasons for shame in a  
belief which had the universal sanction of their own  
and all former ages; which counted in its train philosophers, as well as enthusiasts; which was graced

by the learning of prelates, as well as by the countenance of kings; which the law supported by its mandates, and the purest judges felt no compunctions in  
enforcing. Let Witch Hill remain for ever memorable  
by this sad catastrophe, not to perpetuate our dishonor,  
but as an affecting, enduring proof of human infirmity;  
a proof that perfect justice belongs to one judgment only, &mdash; that which is linked to the throne of  
God.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>In the work which has now reached its close, many  
strange phases of humanity have been exposed. We  
have beheld, with astonishment and horror, the extent  
to which it is liable to be the agent and victim of delusion and ruin. Folly that cannot be exceeded; wrong,  
outrage, and woe, melting the heart that contemplates  
them; and crime, not within our power or province  
to measure, &mdash; have passed before us. But not the  
dark side only of our nature has been displayed.  
Manifestations of innocence, heroism, invincible devotion to truth, integrity of soul triumphing over all the  
terrors and horrors that can be accumulated in life  
and in death, Christian piety in its most heavenly radiance, have mingled in the drama, whose curtain is now  
to fall. Noble specimens of virtue in man and woman,  
old and young, have shed a light, as from above, upon  
its dark and melancholy scenes. Not only the sufferers, but some of those who shared the dread responsibility of the crisis, demand our commiseration, and  
did what they could to atone for their error.</p>  
<p>The conduct of Judge Sewall claims our particular

admiration. He observed annually in private  
a day of humiliation and prayer, during the remainder of his life, to keep fresh in his mind a sense  
of repentance and sorrow for the part he bore in  
the trials. On the day of the general fast, he rose  
in the place where he was accustomed to worship, the  
Old South, in Boston, and, in the presence of the great  
assembly, handed up to the pulpit a written confession,  
acknowledging the error into which he had been led,  
praying for the forgiveness of God and his people, and  
concluding with a request to all the congregation to  
unite with him in devout supplication, that it might  
not bring down the displeasure of the Most High  
upon his country, his family, or himself. He remained standing during the public reading of the  
paper. This was an act of true manliness and dignity  
of soul.</p>  
<p>The following passage is found in his diary, under  
the date of April 23, 1720, nearly thirty years afterwards. It was suggested by the perusal of Neal's  
&ldquo;History of New England:&rdquo; &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;In Dr. Neal's `History of New England,' its nakedness  
is laid open in the businesses of the Quakers, Anabaptists,  
witchcraft. The judges' names are mentioned p. 502; my  
confession, p. 536, vol. ii. The good and gracious God be  
pleased to save New England and me, and my family!&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>There never was a more striking and complete fulfilment of the apostolic assurance, that the prayer of a  
righteous man availeth much, than in this instance.  
God has been pleased, in a remarkable manner, to  
<pb n="443" id="vII443"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2456">  
<figDesc>Page 443.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
save and bless New England. The favor of Heaven  
was bestowed upon Judge Sewall during the remainder  
of his life. He presided for many years on the bench  
where he committed the error so sincerely deplored by  
him, and was regarded by all as a benefactor, an ornament, and a blessing to the community: while his  
family have enjoyed to a high degree the protection  
of Providence from that day to this; have adorned  
every profession, and every department of society;  
have filled with honor the most elevated stations;  
have graced, in successive generations, the same lofty  
seat their ancestor occupied; and been the objects  
of the confidence, respect, and love of their fellow.</p>  
<p>Your thoughts have been led through scenes of the  
most distressing and revolting character. I leave before your imaginations one bright with all the beauty  
of Christian virtue, &mdash; that which exhibits Judge Sewall  
standing forth in the house of his God and in the  
presence of his fellow-worshippers, making a public  
declaration of his sorrow and regret for the mistaken  
judgment he had co-operated with others in pronouncing. Here you have a representation of a truly  
great and magnanimous spirit; a spirit to which  
the divine influence of our religion had given an expansion and a lustre that Roman or Grecian virtue  
never knew; a spirit that had achieved a greater victory than warrior ever won, &mdash; a victory over itself;  
a spirit so noble and so pure, that it felt no shame  
in acknowledging an error, and publicly imploring,

for a great wrong done to his fellow-creatures, the  
forgiveness of God and man.</p>  
<p>Our Essex poet, whose beautiful genius has made  
classical the banks of his own Merrimac, shed a  
romantic light over the early homes and characters  
of New England, and brought back to life the spirit,  
forms, scenes, and men of the past, has not failed to  
immortalize, in his verse, the profound penitence of  
the misguided but upright judge: &mdash;</p>  
<q><lg type="verse">  
<l>&ldquo;Touching and sad, a tale is told,</l>  
<l>Like a penitent hymn of the Psalmist old,</l>  
<l>Of the fast which the good man life-long kept</l>  
<l>With a haunting sorrow that never slept,</l>  
<l>As the circling year brought round the time</l>  
<l>Of an error that left the sting of crime,</l>  
<l>When he sat on the bench of the witchcraft courts,</l>  
<l>With the laws of Moses and `Hale's Reports,'</l>  
<l>And spake, in the name of both, the word</l>  
<l>That gave the witch's neck to the cord,</l>  
<l>And piled the oaken planks that pressed</l>  
<l>The feeble life from the warlock's breast!</l>  
<l>All the day long, from dawn to dawn,</l>  
<l>His door was bolted, his curtain drawn;</l>  
<l>No foot on his silent threshold trod,</l>  
<l>No eye looked on him save that of God,</l>  
<l>As he baffled the ghosts of the dead with charms</l>  
<l>Of penitent tears, and prayers, and psalms,</l>  
<l>And, with precious proofs from the sacred Word</l>  
<l>Of the boundless pity and love of the Lord,</l>  
<l>His faith confirmed and his trust renewed,</l>  
<l>That the sin of his ignorance, sorely rued,</l>  
<l>Might be washed away in the mingled flood</l>  
<l>Of his human sorrow and Christ's dear blood!&rdquo;</l>

<p>When Edward Bishop and his wife Sarah were arrested, household  
goods which were valued by the sheriff himself at ten pounds, &mdash; he  
refusing that sum for their restitution, &mdash; six cows, twenty-four swine,  
forty-six sheep, were taken from his farm. The imprisonment of himself and wife (prior to their escape) aggregated thirty-seven weeks.  
Ten shillings a week for board, and other charges and prison fees  
amounting to five pounds, were assessed upon his estate, and taken by  
distraint. A family of twelve children was left without any to direct  
or care for them, and the product of the farm for that year wholly  
cut off.</p>  
<p>There were taken from the estate of Samuel Wardwell, who was  
executed, five cows, a heifer and yearling, a horse, nine hogs, eight  
loads of hay, six acres of standing corn, and a set of carpenters' tools.  
From the estate of Dorcas Hoar, a widow, there were taken two  
cows, an ox and mare, four pigs, bed, bed-curtains and bedding, and  
other household stuff.</p>  
<p>Persons apprehended were made to pay all charges of every kind  
for their maintenance, fuel, clothes, expenses of transportation from  
jail to jail, and inexorable court and prison fees. The usual fee to the  
clerk of the courts was &pound;1. 17<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 5<hi rend="italics">d.,</hi> sometimes more; sometimes, although very rarely, a little less. He must have received a large  
amount of money in the aggregate that year. The prisoners were  
charged for every paper that was drawn up. If a reprieve was obtained, there was a fee. When discharged, there was a fee. The  
expenses of the executions, even hangmen's fees, were levied on the  
families of the sufferers. Abraham Foster, whose mother died in  
prison, to get her body for burial, had to pay &pound;2. 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></p>  
<p>When the value of money at that time is considered, and we bear  
in mind that most of the persons apprehended were farmers, who  
have but little cash on hand, and that these charges were levied on  
their stock, crops, and furniture in their absence, and in the unrestrained exercise of arbitrary will, by the sheriff or constables, we  
can judge how utterly ruinous the operation must have been.</p></note>  
<note id="v2n7"><p>* Love's Labour's Lost, act v., sc. 1.</p></note>  
<note id="v2n8"><p>&dagger; There are several other depositions in these cases, that may perhaps be explained under the head of nightmare. The following are  
specimens; that, for instance, of Robert Downer, of Salisbury, who  
testifies and says, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;That, several years ago, Susanna Martin, the then wife of George Martin, being brought to court for a witch, the said Downer, having some words  
with her, this deponent, among other things, told her he believed that she  
was a witch, by what was said or witnessed against her; at which she,  
seeming not well affected, said that a, or some, she-devil would fetch  
him away shortly, at which this deponent was not much moved; but at  
night, as he lay in his bed in his own house, alone, there came at his window the likeness of a cat, and by and by came up to his bed, took fast hold  
of his throat, and lay hard upon him a considerable while, and was like  
to throttle him. At length, he minded what Susanna Martin threatened  
him with the day before. he strove what he could, and said, `Avoid, thou  
she-devil, in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost!'  
and then it let him go, and jumped down upon the floor, and went out at  
the window again.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Susanna Martin, by the boldness and severity of her language, in  
defending herself against the charge of witchcraft, had evidently, for a  
long time, rendered herself an object of dread, and seems to have disturbed the dreams of the superstitious throughout the neighborhood.  
For instance, Jarvis Ring, of Salisbury, made oath as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;That, about seven or eight years ago, he had been several times  
afflicted, in the night-time, by some body or some thing coming up upon  
him when he was in bed, and did sorely afflict him by lying upon him;  
and he could neither move nor speak while it was upon him, but sometimes  
made a kind of noise that folks did hear him and come up to him; and, as  
soon as anybody came, it would be gone. This it did for a long time, both  
then and since, but he did never see anybody clearly; but one time, in the  
night, it came upon me as at other times, and I did then see the person of  
Susanna Martin, of Amesbury. I, this deponent, did perfectly see her; and  
she came to this deponent, and took him by the hand, and bit him by the  
finger by force, and then came and lay upon him awhile, as formerly, and  
after a while went away. The print of the bite is yet to be seen on the  
little finger of his right hand; for it was hard to heal. He further saith,  
that several times he was asleep when it came; but, at that time, he was as  
fairly awaked as ever he was, and plainly saw her shape, and felt her teeth,  
as aforesaid.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Barnard Peach made oath substantially as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;That about six or seven years past, being in bed on a Lord's-day night,  
he heard a scrambling at the window, and saw Susanna Martin come in at  
the window, and jump down upon the floor. She was in her hood and  
scarf, and the same dress that she was in before, at meeting the same day.  
Being come in, she was coming up towards this deponent's face, but turned  
back to his feet, and took hold of them, and drew up his body into a heap,  
and lay upon him about an hour and a half or two hours, in all which time  
this deponent could not stir nor speak; but, feeling himself beginning to be  
loosened or lightened, and he beginning to strive, he put out his hand among  
the clothes, and took hold of her hand, and brought it up to his mouth, and  
bit three of the fingers (as he judges) to the breaking of the bones; which  
done, the said Martin went out of the chamber, down the stairs, and out of  
the door. The deponent further declared, that, on another Lord's-day night,  
while sleeping on the hay in a barn, about midnight the said Susanna  
Martin and another came out of the shop into the barn, and one of them said,  
`Here he is,' and then came towards this deponent. He, having a quarterstaff, made a blow at them; but the roof of the barn prevented it, and they  
went away: but this deponent followed them, and, as they were going  
towards the window, made another blow at them, and struck them both  
down; but away they went out at the shop-window, and this deponent saw  
no more of them. And the rumor went, that the said Martin had a broken  
head at that time; but the deponent cannot speak to that upon his own  
knowledge.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Any one who has had the misfortune to be subject to nightmare  
will find the elements of his own experience very much resembling  
the descriptions given by Kembal, Downer, Ring, and Peach. The  
terrors to which superstition, credulity, and ignorance subjected their  
minds; the frightful tales of witchcraft and apparitions to which they  
were accustomed to listen; and the contagious fears of the neighborhood in reference to Susanna Martin, taken in connection with a  
disordered digestion, an overloaded stomach, and a hard bed, or  
a strange lodging-place, &mdash; are wholly sufficient to account for all the  
phenomena to which they testified.</p></note>

<p>[The subject of Salem Witchcraft has been traced to its conclusion, and  
discussed within its proper limits, in the foregoing work. But whoever is  
interested in it as a chapter of history or an exhibition of humanity may feel  
a curiosity, on some points, that reasonably demands gratification. The  
questions will naturally arise, Who were the earliest to extricate themselves  
and the public from the delusion? what is known, beyond the facts mentioned  
in the progress of the foregoing discussion, of the later fortunes of its prominent actors? what the-view taken in the retrospect by individuals and public  
bodies implicated in the transaction? and what opinions on the general subject have subsequently prevailed? To answer these questions is the design  
of this Supplement.]</p>  
<p>It can hardly be said that there was any open and avowed opposition in the community to the proceedings during their early  
progress. There is some uncertainty and obscurity to what extent there was an unexpressed dissent in the minds of particular  
private persons. On the general subject of the existence and  
power of the Devil and his agency, more or less, in influencing  
human and earthly affairs, it would be difficult to prove that there  
was any considerable difference of opinion.</p>  
<p>The first undisguised and unequivocal opposition to the proceedings was a remarkable document that has recently come to  
light. Among some papers which have found their way to the  
custody of the Essex Institute, is a letter, dated &ldquo;Salisbury, Aug.  
9, 1692,&rdquo; addressed &ldquo;To the worshipful Jonathan Corwin, Esq.,  
these present at his house in Salem.&rdquo; It is indorsed, &ldquo;A letter  
<pb n="448" id="vII448"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2461">  
<figDesc>Page 448.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to my grandfather, on account of the condemnation of the witches.&rdquo;  
Its date shows that it was written while the public infatuation and  
fury were at their height, and the Court was sentencing to death  
and sending to the gallows its successive cartloads. There is no  
injunction of secresy, and no shrinking from responsibility. Although the name of the writer is not given in full, he was evidently  
well known to Corwin, and had written to him before on the subject. The messenger, in accordance with the superscription, undoubtedly delivered it into the hands of the judge at his residence  
on the corner of Essex and North Streets. The fact that Jonathan  
Corwin preserved this document, and placed it in the permanent  
files of his family papers, is pretty good proof that he appreciated  
the weight of its arguments. It is not improbable that he expressed  
himself to that effect to his brethren on the bench, and perhaps to  
others. What he said, and the fact that he was holding such a  
correspondence, may have reached the ears of the accusers, and  
led them to commence a movement against him by crying out upon  
his mother-in-law.</p>  
<p>The letter is a most able argument against the manner in which  
the trials were conducted, and, by conclusive logic, overthrows the  
whole fabric of the evidence on the strength of which the Court  
was convicting and taking the lives of innocent persons. No such  
piece of reasoning has come to us from that age. Its author must  
be acknowledged to have been an expert in dialectic subtleties, and  
a pure reasoner of unsurpassed acumen and force. It requires,  
but it will reward, the closest attention and concentration of  
thought in following the threads of the argument. It reaches its  
conclusions on a most difficult subject with clearness and certainty.  
It achieves and realizes, in mere mental processes, quantities, and  
forces, on the points at which it aims, what is called demonstration  
in mathematics and geometry.</p>  
<p>The writer does not discredit, but seems to have received, the  
then prevalent doctrines relating to the personality, power, and  
attributes of the Devil; and, from that standpoint, controverts  
and demolishes the principles on which the Court was proceeding,  
in reference to the &ldquo;spectral evidence&rdquo; and the credibility of the  
&ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; generally. The letter, and the formal argument appended to it, arrest notice in one or two general aspects.  
There is an appearance of their having proceeded from an elderly  
<pb n="449" id="vII449"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2462">  
<figDesc>Page 449.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
person, not at all from any marks of infirmity of intellect, but  
rather from an air of wisdom and a tone of authority which can only  
result from long experience and observation. The circumstance  
that an amanuensis was employed, and the author writes the  
initials of his signature only, strengthens this impression. At  
the same time, there are indications of a free and progressive  
spirit, more likely to have had force at an earlier period of life.  
In some aspects, the document indicates a theological education,  
and familiarity with matters that belong to the studies of a minister; in others, it manifests habits of mind and modes of expression  
and reasoning more natural to one accustomed to close legal statements and deductions. If the production of a trained professional  
man of either class, it would justly be regarded as remarkable.  
If its author belonged to neither class, but was merely a local magistrate, farmer, and militia officer, it becomes more than remarkable.  
There must have been a high development among the founders of  
our villages, when the laity could present examples of such a capacity to grasp the most difficult subjects, and conduct such acute  
and abstruse disquisitions. [See Appendix.]</p>  
<p>The question as to the authorship of this paper may well excite  
interest, involving, as it does, minute critical speculations. The  
elements that enter into its solution illustrate the difficulties and  
perplexities encompassing the study of local antiquities, and attempts to determine the origin and bearings of old documents or to  
settle minute points of history. The weight of evidence seems to  
indicate that the document is attributable to Major Robert Pike, of  
Salisbury. Whoever was its author did his duty nobly, and stands  
alone, above all the scholars and educated men of the time, in bearing testimony openly, bravely, in the very ears of the Court, against  
the disgraceful and shocking course they were pursuing.<note target="v2n9">*</note></p>

until many years afterwards. He says that &ldquo;the witches' meetings,  
the Devil's baptisms and mock sacraments, which the accusing and  
confessing witches oft speak of, are nothing else but the effect of  
their fancy, depraved and deluded by the Devil, and not a reality  
to be regarded or minded by any wise man.&rdquo; He charges the judges  
with having taken testimony from the Devil himself, through witnesses who swore to what they said the Devil communicated  
to them, thus indirectly introducing the Devil as a witness;  
and he clinches the accusation by quoting the judges themselves,  
who, when the accusing and confessing witnesses contradicted each  
other, got over the difficulty by saying that the Devil, in such instances, took away the memory of some of them, for the moment,  
obscuring their brains, and misleading them. He sums up this part  
of his reasoning in these words: &ldquo;If it be thus granted that the  
Devil is able to represent false ideas to the imaginations of the confessors, what man of sense will regard the confessions, or any of the  
words of these confessors?&rdquo; He says that he knows several persons &ldquo;about the Bay,&rdquo; &mdash; men, for understanding, judgment, and  
piety, inferior to few, if any, in New England, &mdash; that do utterly  
condemn the said proceedings. He repudiates the idea that Salem  
was, in any sense, exclusively responsible for the transaction; and  
affirms that &ldquo;other justices in the country, besides the Salem justices,  
<pb n="453" id="vII453"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2466">  
<figDesc>Page 453.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
have issued out their warrants;&rdquo; and states, that, of the eight  
&ldquo;judges, commissioned for this Court at Salem, five do belong to  
Suffolk County, four of which five do belong to Boston, and therefore I see no reason why Boston should talk of Salem as though  
their own judges had had no hand in these proceedings in Salem.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>There is one view of the subject, upon which Brattle presses  
with much force and severity. There is ground to suspect, that the  
proceedings were suffered to go on after some of those appearing  
to countenance them had ceased to have faith in the accusations.  
He charges, directly, complicity in the escape of Mrs. Carey, Mrs.  
English, Captain Alden, Hezekiah Usher, and others, upon the  
high officials; and says that while the evidence, upon which so  
many had been imprisoned, sentenced, and executed, bore against  
Mrs. Thacher, of Boston, she was never proceeded against. &ldquo;She  
was much complained of by the afflicted persons, and yet the  
justices would not issue out their warrants to apprehend&rdquo; her and  
certain others; while at the very same time they were issuing, upon  
no better or other grounds, warrants against so many others. He  
charges the judges with this most criminal favoritism. The facts  
hardly justify such an imputation upon the judges. They did not,  
after the trials had begun, it is probable, ever issue warrants:  
that was the function of magistrates. With the exception, perhaps, of Corwin, I think there is no evidence of there having been  
any doubts or misgivings on the bench. It is altogether too heavy  
a charge to bring, without the strongest evidence, upon any one.  
To intimate that officials, or any persons, who did not believe in  
the accusations, connived at the escape of their friends and relatives, and at the same time countenanced, pretended to believe,  
and gave deadly effect to them when directed against others, is  
supposing a criminality and baseness too great to be readily admitted. In that wild reign of the worst of passions, this would  
have transcended them all in its iniquity. The only excusable  
people at that time were those who honestly, and without a doubt,  
believed in the guilt of the convicted. Those who had doubts,  
and did not frankly and fearlessly express them, were the guilty  
ones. On their hands is the stain of the innocent blood that was  
shed. It is not probable, and is scarcely possible, that any considerable number could be at once doubters and prosecutors. On this  
<pb n="454" id="vII454"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2467">  
<figDesc>Page 454.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
point, Brattle must be understood to mean, not that judges, or  
others actively engaged in the prosecutions, warded off proceedings against particular friends or relatives from a principle of  
deliberate favoritism, but that third parties, actuated by a sycophantic spirit, endeavored to hush up or intercept complaints,  
when directed too near to the high officials, or thought to gain  
their favor by aiding the escape of persons in whom they were  
interested.</p>  
<p>Brattle uses the same weapon which afterwards the opponents  
of Mr. Parris, in his church at Salem Village, wielded with such  
decisive effect against him and all who abetted him. It is much  
to be lamented, that, instead of hiding it under a confidential letter,  
he did not at the time openly bring it to bear in the most public  
and defiant manner. One brave, strong voice, uttered in the face  
of the court and in the congregations of the people, echoed from  
the corners of the streets, and reaching the ears of the governor  
and magistrates, denouncing the entire proceedings as the damnable crime of familiarity with evil spirits, and sorcery of the  
blackest dye, might perhaps have recalled the judges, the people,  
and the rulers to their senses. If the spirit of the ancient prophets  
of God, of the Quakers of the preceding age, or of true reformers of any age, had existed in any breast, the experiment would  
have been tried. Brattle says, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;I cannot but admire that any should go with their distempered  
friends and relations to the afflicted children, to know what their distempered friends ail, whether they are not bewitched, who it is that  
afflicts them, and the like. It is true, I know no reason why these  
afflicted may not be consulted as well as any other, if so be that it was  
only their natural and ordinary knowledge that was had recourse to:  
but it is not on this notion that these afflicted children are sought unto,  
but as they have a supernatural knowledge; a knowledge which they  
obtain by their holding correspondence with spectres or evil spirits, as  
they themselves grant. This consulting of these afflicted children,  
as abovesaid, seems to me to be a very gross evil, a real abomination,  
not fit to be known in New England; and yet is a thing practised, not  
only by <hi rend="italics">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italics">John,</hi> &mdash; I mean the rude and more ignorant sort, &mdash;  
but by many who profess high, and pass among us for some of the  
better sort. This is that which aggravates the evil, and makes it  
heinous and tremendous; and yet this is not the worst of it, &mdash; for, as  
<pb n="455" id="vII455"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2468">  
<figDesc>Page 455.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
sure as I now write to you, even some of our civil leaders and spiritual  
teachers, who, I think, should punish and preach down such sorcery  
and wickedness, do yet allow of, encourage, yea, and practise, this  
very abomination. I know there are several worthy gentlemen in  
Salem who account this practice as an abomination, have trembled to  
see the methods of this nature which others have used, and have declared themselves to think the practice to be very evil and corrupt.  
But all avails little with the abettors of the said practice.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>If Mr. Brattle and the &ldquo;several worthy gentlemen&rdquo; to whom  
he alludes, instead of sitting in &ldquo;trembling&rdquo; silence, or whispering in private their disapprobation, or writing letters under the injunction of secrecy, had come boldly out, and denounced the whole  
thing, in a spirit of true courage, meeting and defying the risk,  
and carrying the war home, and promptly, upon the ministers,  
magistrates, and judges, they might have succeeded, and exploded  
the delusion before it had reached its fatal results.</p>  
<p>He mentions, in the course of his letter, among those persons  
known by him to disapprove of the proceedings, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The Hon. Simon Bradstreet, Esq. (our late governor), the Hon.  
Thomas Danforth, Esq. (our late deputy-governor), the Rev. Mr.  
Increase Mather, and the Rev. Mr. Samuel Willard. Major N. Saltonstall, Esq., who was one of the judges, has left the court, and is  
very much dissatisfied with the proceedings of it. Excepting Mr.  
Hale, Mr. Noyes, and Mr. Parris, the reverend elders, almost throughout the whole country, are very much dissatisfied. Several of the  
late justices &mdash; viz., Thomas Graves, Esq.; N. Byfield, Esq.; Francis  
Foxcroft, Esq. &mdash; are much dissatisfied; also several of the present  
justices, and, in particular, some of the Boston justices, were resolved  
rather to throw up their commissions than be active in disturbing the  
liberty of Their Majesties' subjects merely on the accusations of these  
afflicted, possessed children.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It is to be observed, that the dissatisfaction was with some of  
the methods adopted in the proceedings, and not with the prosecutions themselves. Increase Mather and Samuel Willard signed  
the paper indorsing Deodat Lawson's famous sermon, which surely  
drove on the prosecutions; and the former expressed, in print,  
his approbation of his son Cotton's &ldquo;Wonders of the Invisible  
World,&rdquo; in which he labors to defend the witchcraft prosecutions,  
and to make it out that those who suffered were &ldquo;malefactors.&rdquo;  
<pb n="456" id="vII456"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2469">  
<figDesc>Page 456.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Dr. Increase Mather is understood to have countenanced the  
burning of Calef's book, some few years afterwards, in the square  
of the public grounds of Harvard College, of which institution he  
was then president. It cannot be doubted, however, that both the  
elder Mather and Mr. Willard had expressed, more or less distinctly, their disapprobation of some of the details of the proceedings. It is honorable to their memories, and shows that the former  
was not wholly blinded by parental weakness, but willing to express his dissent, in some particulars, from the course of his  
distinguished son, and that the latter had an independence of  
character which enabled him to criticise and censure a court in  
which three of his parishioners sat as judges.</p>  
<p>Brattle relates a story which seems to indicate that Increase  
Mather sometimes was unguarded enough to express himself with  
severity against those who gave countenance to the proceedings.  
&ldquo;A person from Boston, of no small note, carried up his child  
to Salem, near twenty miles, on purpose that he might consult the  
afflicted about his child, which accordingly he did; and the afflicted  
told him that his child was afflicted by Mrs. Carey and Mrs. Obinson.&rdquo; The &ldquo;afflicted,&rdquo; in this and some other instances, had struck  
too high. The magistrates in Boston were unwilling to issue a  
warrant against Mrs. Obinson, and Mrs. Carey had fled. All  
that the man got for his pains, in carrying his child to Salem, was  
a hearty scolding from Increase Mather, who asked him &ldquo;whether  
there was not a God in Boston, that he should go to the Devil, in  
Salem, for advice.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Bradstreet's great age prevented, it is to be supposed, his  
public appearance in the affair; but his course in a case which  
occurred twelve years before fully justifies confidence in the  
statement of Brattle. The tradition has always prevailed, that  
he looked with disapprobation upon the proceedings, from beginning to end. The course of his sons, and the action taken  
against them, is quite decisive to the point.</p>  
<p>Facts have been stated, which show that Thomas Danforth, if  
he disapproved of the proceedings at Salem, in October, must  
have undergone a rapid change of sentiments. No irregularities,  
improprieties, extravagances, or absurdities ever occurred in the  
examinations or trials greater than he was fully responsible for in  
April. Having, in the mean while, been superseded in office, he  
<pb n="457" id="vII457"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2470">  
<figDesc>Page 457.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
had leisure, in his retirement, to think over the whole matter;  
and it is satisfactory to find that he saw the error of the ways in  
which he had gone himself, and led others.</p>  
<p>The result of the inquiry on this point is, that, while some, outside of the village, began early to doubt the propriety of the  
proceedings in certain particulars, they failed, with the single exception of Robert Pike, to make manly and seasonable resistance.  
He remonstrated in a writing signed with his own initials, and  
while the executions were going on. He sent it to one of the  
judges, and did not shrink from having his action known. No  
other voice was raised, no one else breasted the storm, while it  
lasted. The errors which led to the delusion were not attacked  
from any quarter at any time during that generation, and have  
remained lurking in many minds, in a greater or less degree, to  
our day.</p>  
<p>There were, however, three persons in Salem Village and its  
immediate vicinity, who deserve to be for ever remembered in  
this connection. They resisted the fanaticism at the beginning,  
and defined its wrath. Joseph Putnam was a little more than  
twenty-two years of age. He probably did not enter into the  
question of the doctrines then maintained on such subjects, but  
was led by his natural sagacity and independent spirit to the  
course he took. In opposition to both his brothers and both his  
uncles, and all the rest of his powerful and extensive family, he  
denounced the proceedings through and through. At the very  
moment when the excitement was at its most terrible stage, and  
Mr. Parris held the life of every one in his hands, Joseph Putnam  
expressed his disapprobation of his conduct by carrying his infant  
child to the church in Salem to be baptized. This was a public  
and most significant act. For six months, he kept some one of  
his horses under saddle night and day, without a moment's intermission of the precaution; and he and his family were constantly  
armed. It was understood, that, if any one attempted to arrest  
him, it would be at the peril of life. If the marshal should approach with overwhelming force, he would spring to his saddle,  
and bid defiance to pursuit. Such a course as this, taken by one  
standing alone against the whole community to which he belonged,  
shows a degree of courage, spirit, and resolution, which cannot but  
be held in honor.</p>

</p>  
<p>Martha Corey was an aged Christian professor, of eminently  
devout habits and principles. It is, indeed, a strange fact, that,  
in her humble home, surrounded, as it then was, by a wilderness,  
this husbandman's wife should have reached a height so above and  
beyond her age. But it is proved conclusively by the depositions  
adduced against her, that her mind was wholly disenthralled from  
the errors of that period. She utterly repudiated the doctrines of  
witchcraft, and expressed herself freely and fearlessly against  
them. The prayer which this woman made &ldquo;upon the ladder,&rdquo;  
and which produced such an impression on those who heard it, was  
undoubtedly expressive of enlightened piety, worthy of being characterized as &ldquo;eminent&rdquo; in its sentiments, and in its demonstration  
of an innocent heart and life.</p>  
<p>The following paper, in the handwriting of Mr. Parris, is among  
the court-files. It has not the ordinary form of a deposition, but  
somehow was sworn to in Court: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The morning after the examination of Goody Nurse, Sam. Sibley  
met John Procter about Mr. Phillips's, who called to said Sibley as he  
was going to said Phillips's, and asked how the folks did at the village.  
He answered, he heard they were very bad last night, but he had heard  
nothing this morning. Procter replied, he was going to fetch home his  
jade; he left her there last night, and had rather given forty shillings  
than let her come up. Said Sibley asked why he talked so. Procter  
replied, if they were let alone so, we should all be devils and witches  
quickly; they should rather be had to the whipping-post; but he would  
fetch his jade home, and thrash the Devil out of her, &mdash; and more to the  
like purpose, crying, `Hang them! hang them!&rdquo;'</p></q>  
<p>In another document, it is stated that Nathaniel Ingersoll and  
others heard John Procter tell Joseph Pope, &ldquo;that, if he had John  
Indian in his custody, he would soon beat the Devil out of him.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The declarations thus ascribed to John Procter show that his  
views of the subject were about right; and it will probably be generally conceded, that the treatment he proposed for Mary Warren  
and &ldquo;John Indian,&rdquo; if dealt out to the &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; generally at the outset, would have prevented all the mischief. A  
sound thrashing all round, seasonably administered, would have  
reached the root of the matter; and the story which has now been  
concluded of Salem witchcraft would never have been told.</p>  
<p>When the witchcraft tornado burst upon Andover, it prostrated  
<pb n="459" id="vII459"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2472">  
<figDesc>Page 459.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
every thing before it. Accusers and accused were counted by  
scores, and under the panic of the hour the accused generally  
confessed. But Andover was the first to recover its senses. On  
the 12th of October, 1692, seven of its citizens addressed a memorial to the General Court in behalf of their wives and children,  
praying that they might be released on bond, &ldquo;to remain as  
prisoners in their own houses, where they may be more tenderly  
cared for.&rdquo; They speak of their &ldquo;distressed condition in prison,  
&mdash; a company of poor distressed creatures as full of inward grief  
and trouble as they are able to bear up in life withal.&rdquo; They  
refer to the want of &ldquo;food convenient&rdquo; for them, and to &ldquo;the coldness of the winter season that is coming which may despatch such  
out of the way that have not been used to such hardships,&rdquo; and  
represent the ruinous effects of their absence from their families,  
who were at the same time required to maintain them in jail. On  
the 18th of October, the two ministers of Andover, Francis Dane  
and Thomas Barnard, with twenty-four other citizens of Andover,  
addressed a similar memorial to the Governor and General Court,  
in which we find the first public expression of condemnation of  
the proceedings. They call the accusers &ldquo;distempered persons.&rdquo;  
They express the opinion that their friends and neighbors have  
been misrepresented. They bear the strongest testimony in favor  
of the persons accused, that several of them are members of the  
church in full communion, of blameless conversation, and &ldquo;walking as becometh women professing godliness.&rdquo; They relate the  
methods by which they had been deluded and terrified into confession, and show the worthlessness of those confessions as evidences against them. They use this bold and significant language:  
&ldquo;Our troubles we foresee are likely to continue and increase, if  
other methods be not taken than as yet have been; and we know  
not who can think himself safe, if the accusations of children and  
others who are under a diabolical influence shall be received  
against persons of good fame.&rdquo; On the 2d of January, 1693,  
the Rev. Francis Dane addressed a letter to a brother clergyman,  
which is among the files, and was probably designed to reach the  
eyes of the Court, in which he vindicates Andover against the  
scandalous reports got up by the accusers, and says that a residence there of forty-four years, and intimacy with the people,  
enable him to declare that they are not justly chargeable with any  
<pb n="460" id="vII460"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2473">  
<figDesc>Page 460.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
such things as witchcraft, charms, or sorceries of any kind. He  
expresses himself in strong language: &ldquo;Had charity been put  
on, the Devil would not have had such an advantage against us,  
and I believe many innocent persons have been accused and  
imprisoned.&rdquo; He denounces &ldquo;the conceit of spectre evidence,&rdquo;  
and warns against continuing in a course of proceeding that will  
procure &ldquo;the divine displeasure.&rdquo; A paper signed by Dudley  
Bradstreet, Francis Dane, Thomas Barnard, and thirty-eight other  
men and twelve women of Andover, was presented to the Court  
at Salem to the same effect.</p>  
<p>None of the persons named by Brattle can present so strong a  
claim to the credit of having opposed the witchcraft fanaticism  
before the close of the year 1692, as Francis Dane, his colleague  
Barnard, and the citizens of Andover, who signed memorials to the  
Legislature on the 18th of October, and to the Court of Trials about  
the same time. There is, indeed, one conclusive proof that the  
venerable senior pastor of the Andover Church made his disapprobation of the witchcraft proceedings known at an earlier period,  
at least in his immediate neighborhood. The wrath of the accusers was concentrated upon him to an unparalleled extent from  
their entrance into Andover. They did not venture to attack him  
directly. His venerable age and commanding position made it  
inexpedient; but they struck as near him, and at as many points,  
as they dared. They accused, imprisoned, and caused to be convicted and sentenced to death, one of his daughters, Abigail  
Faulkner. They accused, imprisoned, and brought to trial another,  
Elizabeth Johnson. They imprisoned, and brought to the sentence  
of death, his grand-daughter, Elizabeth Johnson, Jr. They cried  
out against, and caused to be imprisoned, several others of his  
grandchildren. They accused and imprisoned Deliverance the  
wife, and also the &ldquo;man-servant,&rdquo; of his son Nathaniel. There  
is reason for supposing, as has been stated, that Elizabeth How  
was the wife of his nephew. Surely, no one was more signalized  
by their malice and resentment than Francis Dane; and he  
deserves to be recognized as standing pre-eminent, and, for a  
time, almost alone, in bold denunciation and courageous resistance of the execrable proceedings of that dark day.</p>  
<p>Francis Dane made the following statement, also designed to  
reach the authorities, which cannot be read by any person of sensibility  
<pb n="461" id="vII461"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2474">  
<figDesc>Page 461.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
without feeling its force, although it made no impression  
upon the Court at the time: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Concerning my daughter Elizabeth Johnson, I never had ground  
to suspect her, neither have I heard any other to accuse her, till by  
spectre evidence she was brought forth; but this I must say, she was  
weak, and incapacious, fearful, and in that respect I fear she hath  
falsely accused herself and others. Not long before she was sent for,  
she spake as to her own particular, that she was sure she was no  
witch. And for her daughter Elizabeth, she is but simplish at the  
best; and I fear the common speech, that was frequently spread among  
us, of their liberty if they would confess, and the like expression  
used by some, have brought many into a snare. The Lord direct and  
guide those that are in place, and give us all submissive wills; and let  
the Lord do with me and mine what seems good in his own eyes!&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>There is nothing in the proceedings of the Special Court of  
Oyer and Terminer more disgraceful than the fact, that the regular Court of Superior Judicature, the next year, after the public  
mind had been rescued from the delusion, and the spectral evidence repudiated, proceeded to try these and other persons, and,  
in the face of such statements as the foregoing, actually condemned to death Elizabeth Johnson, Jr.</p>  
<p>It is remarkable that Brattle does not mention Calef. The  
understanding has been that they acted in concert, and that Brattle  
had a hand in getting up some of Calef's arguments. The silence  
of Brattle is not, upon the whole, at all inconsistent with their  
mutual action and alliance. As Calef was more perfectly unembarrassed, without personal relations to the clergy and others in  
high station, and not afraid to stand in the gap, it was thought  
best to let him take the fire of Cotton Mather. His name had  
not been connected with the matter in the public apprehension.  
He was a merchant of Boston, and a son of Robert Calef of  
Roxbury. His attention was called to the proceedings which originated in Salem Village; and his strong faculties and moral courage  
enabled him to become the most efficient opponent, in his day,  
of the system of false reasoning upon which the prosecutions  
rested. He prepared several able papers in different forms, in  
which he discussed the subject with great ability, and treated  
Cotton Mather and all others whom he regarded as instrumental in precipitating the community into the fatal tragedy,  
<pb n="462" id="vII462"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2475">  
<figDesc>Page 462.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
with the greatest severity of language and force of logic, holding  
up the whole procedure to merited condemnation. They were  
first printed, at London, in 1700, in a small quarto volume, under  
the title of &ldquo;More Wonders of the Invisible World.&rdquo; This publication burst like a bomb-shell upon all who had been concerned in promoting the witchcraft prosecutions. Cotton Mather  
was exasperated to the highest pitch. He says in his diary: &ldquo;He  
sent this vile volume to London to be published, and the book is  
printed; and the impression is, this day week, arrived here. The  
books that I have sent over into England, with a design to glorify  
the Lord Jesus Christ, are not published, but strangely delayed;  
and the books that are sent over to vilify me, and render me incapable to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, &mdash; these are published.&rdquo;  
Calef's writings gave a shock to Mather's influence, from which it  
never recovered.</p>  
<p>Great difficulty has been experienced in drawing the story out  
in its true chronological sequence. The effect produced upon the  
public mind, when it became convinced that the proceedings had  
been wrong, and innocent blood shed, was a universal disposition  
to bury the recollection of the whole transaction in silence, and, if  
possible, oblivion. This led to a suppression and destruction of  
the ordinary materials of history. Papers were abstracted from  
the files, documents in private hands were committed to the flames,  
and a chasm left in the records of churches and public bodies.  
The journal of the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer is nowhere to be found. Hutchinson appears to have had access to it.  
It cannot well be supposed to have been lost by fire or other accident, because the records of the regular Court, up to the very time  
when the Special Court came into operation, and from the time  
when it expired, are preserved in order. A portion of the papers  
connected with the trials have come down in a miscellancous,  
scattered, and dilapidated state, in the offices of the Clerk of the  
Courts in the County of Essex, and of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. By far the larger part have been abstracted, of which  
a few have been deposited, by parties into whose hands they had  
happened to come, with the Massachusetts Historical Society in  
Boston and the Essex Institute at Salem. The records of the parish of Salem Village, although exceedingly well kept before and  
after 1692 by Thomas Putnam, are in another hand for that  
<pb n="463" id="vII463"/>

</figure>  
year, very brief, and make no reference whatever to the witchcraft transactions. This general desire to obliterate the memory  
of the calamity has nearly extinguished tradition. It is more  
scanty and less reliable than on any other event at an equal distance in the past. A subject on which men avoided to speak soon  
died out of knowledge. The localities of many very interesting  
incidents cannot be identified. This is very observable, and peculiarly remarkable as to places in the now City of Salem. The  
reminiscences floating about are vague, contradictory, and few in  
number. In a community of uncommon intelligence, composed, to  
a greater degree perhaps than almost any other, of families that have  
been here from the first, very inquisitive for knowledge, and always  
imbued with the historical spirit, it is truly surprising how little  
has been borne down, by speech and memory, in the form of anecdote, personal traits, or local incidents, of this most extraordinary and wonderful occurrence of such world-wide celebrity.  
Almost all that we know is gleaned from the offices of the Registry of Deeds and Wills.<note target="v2n10">*</note></p>

<p>to describe, into which the community suffered itself  
to be led in the witchcraft proceedings of 1692, &mdash;  
with a desire, on the contrary, to make the lesson then  
given of the mischief resulting from misguided enthusiasm, and which will always result when popular excitement is allowed to wield the organized powers of  
society, as impressive as facts and truth will justify,  
&mdash; I feel bound to say, in advance, that there are some  
considerations which we must keep before us, while reviewing the incidents of the transaction. The theological, legal, and philosophical doctrines and the popular  
beliefs, on which it was founded, have, as I have shown,  
led, in other countries and periods, to similar, and often  
vastly more shameful, cruel, and destructive results.  
But there was something in the affair, as it was developed here, that has arrested the notice of mankind,  
and clothed it with an inherent interest, beyond all  
other events of the kind that have elsewhere or ever  
occurred.</p>  
<p>The moral force engendered in the civilization planted on these shores, and pervading the whole body of  
society, supplied a mightier momentum, as it does  
to this day, and ever will, to the movement of the  
people, acting in a mass and as a unit, than can anywhere else be found. A population, invigorated by  
hardy enterprise, and the constant exercise of all the  
faculties of freedom, and actuated throughout by individual energy of character, must be mightier in motion than any other people. Such a population multiplies tenfold its physical forces, by the addition of

she followed him so soon to the grave. Of the other accusers,  
we have but little information. Elizabeth Booth was married to  
Israel Shaw about the year 1700. Mary Walcot was married,  
somewhere between 1692 and 1697, to a person belonging to Woburn, whose name is torn or worn off from Mr. Parris's records.  
Of the other &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; nothing is known, beyond the  
fact, that the Act of the Legislature of the Province, reversing  
the judgments, and taking off the attainder from those who were  
sentenced to death in 1692, has this paragraph: &ldquo;Some of the  
principal accusers and witnesses in those dark and severe prosecutions have since discovered themselves to be persons of profligate  
and vicious conversation;&rdquo; and Calef speaks of them as &ldquo;vile  
varlets,&rdquo; and asserts that their reputations were not without spot  
before, and that subsequently they became abandoned to open  
and shameless vice.</p>  
<p>A very considerable number of the people left the place. John  
Shepard and Samuel Sibley sold their lands, and went elsewhere;  
as did Peter Cloyse, who never brought his family to the village  
after his wife's release from prison. Edward and Sarah Bishop  
sold their estates, and took up their abode at Rehoboth. Some  
of the Raymond family removed to Middleborough. The Haynes  
family emigrated to New Jersey. No mention is afterwards found  
of other families in the record-books. The descendants of Thomas  
and Edward Putnam, in the next generation, were mostly dispersed  
<pb n="466" id="vII466"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2479">  
<figDesc>Page 466.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to other places; but those of Joseph remained on his lands,  
and have occupied his homestead to this day. It is a singular  
circumstance, that some of the spots where, particularly, the  
great mischief was brewed, are, and long have been, deserted.  
Where the parsonage stood, with its barn and garden and well  
and pathways, is now a bare and rugged field, without a vestige  
of its former occupancy, except a few broken bricks that mark the  
site of the house. The same is the case of the homestead of Jonathan Walcot. It was in these two families that the affair began  
and was matured. The spots where several others, who figured  
in the proceedings, lived, have ceased to be occupied; and the  
only signs of former habitation are hollows in the ground, fragments of pottery, and heaps of stones denoting the location of  
cellars and walls. Here and there, where houses and other structures once stood, the blight still rests.</p>  
<p>Some circumstances relating to the personal history of those  
who experienced the greatest misery during the prevalence of the  
dreadful fanaticism, and were left to mourn over its victims, have  
happened to be preserved in records and documents on file. On  
the 30th of November, 1699, Margaret Jacobs was married to  
John Foster. She belonged to Mr. Noyes's parish; but the recollection of his agency in pushing on proceedings which carried in  
their train the execution of her aged grandfather, the exile of her  
father, the long imprisonment of her mother and herself, with the  
prospect of a violent and shameful death hanging over them every  
hour, and, above all, her own wretched abandonment of truth and  
conscience for a while, probably under his persuasion, made it  
impossible for her to think of being married by him. Mr. Greene  
was known to sympathize with those who had suffered, and the  
couple went to the village to be united. Some years afterwards,  
when the church of the Middle Precinct, now South Danvers, was  
organized, John and Margaret Foster, among the first, took their  
children there for baptism; and their descendants are numerous,  
in this neighborhood and elsewhere. Margaret, the widow of  
John Willard, married William Towne. Elizabeth, the widow  
of John Procter, married, subsequently to 1696, a person named  
Richards. Edward Bishop, the husband of Bridget, a few years  
afterwards was appointed guardian of Susannah Mason, the only  
child of Christian, who was the only child of Bridget by her  
<pb n="467" id="vII467"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2480">  
<figDesc>Page 467.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
former husband Thomas Oliver. Bishop seems to have invested  
the money of his ward in the lot at the extreme end of Forrester  
Street, where it connects with Essex Street, bounded by Forrester Street on the north and east, and Essex Street on the  
south. This was the property of Susannah when she married  
John Becket, Jr. Bishop appears to have continued his business of a sawyer to a very advanced age, and died in Salem, in  
1705.</p>  
<p>Sarah Nurse, about two years after her mother's death, married  
Michael Bowden, of Marblehead; and they occupied her father's  
house, in the town of Salem, of which he had retained the possession. His family having thus all been married off, Francis  
Nurse gave up his homestead to his son Samuel, and divided his  
remaining property among his four sons and four daughters. He  
made no formal deed or will, but drew up a paper, dated Dec. 4,  
1694, describing the distribution of the estate, and what he expected of his children. He gave them immediate occupancy and  
possession of their respective portions. The provision made by  
the old man for his comfort, and the conditions required of his  
children, are curious. They give an interesting insight of the life  
of a rural patriarch. He reserved his &ldquo;great chair and cushion;&rdquo;  
a great chest; his bed and bedding; wardrobe, linen and woollen;  
a pewter pot; one mare, bridle, saddle, and sufficient fodder; the  
whole of the crop of corn, both Indian and English, he had made  
that year. The children were to discharge all the debts of his  
estate, pay him fourteen pounds a year, and contribute equally,  
as much more as might be necessary for his comfortable maintenance, and also to his &ldquo;decent burial.&rdquo; The labors of his life  
had closed. He had borne the heaviest burden that can be laid  
on the heart of a good man. He found rest, and sought solace  
and support, in the society and love of his children and their families, as he rode from house to house on the road he had opened,  
by which they all communicated with each other. The parish  
records show that he continued his interest in its affairs. He  
lived just long enough to behold sure evidence that justice would  
be done to the memory of those who suffered, and the authors of  
the mischief be consigned to the condemnation of mankind. The  
tide, upon which Mr. Parris had ridden to the destruction of so  
many, had turned; and it was becoming apparent to all, that  
<pb n="468" id="vII468"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2481">  
<figDesc>Page 468.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
he would soon be compelled to disappear from his ministry in  
the village, before the awakening resentment of the people and the  
ministers. Francis Nurse died on the 22d of November, 1695,  
seventy-seven years of age. His sons with their wives, and his  
daughters with their husbands, went into the Probate Court with  
the paper before described, and unanimously requested the judge  
to have the estate divided according to its terms. This is conclusive proof that the father had been just and wise in his arrangements, and that true fraternal love and harmony pervaded the  
whole family. The descendants, under the names of Bowden,  
Tarbell, and Russell, are dispersed in various parts of the country: those under the name of Preston, while some have gone  
elsewhere, have been ever since, and still are, among the most  
respectable and honored citizens of the village. Some of the  
name of Nurse have also remained, and worthily represent and  
perpetuate it.</p>  
<p>I have spoken of the tide's beginning to turn in 1695. Sure  
indications to that effect were then quite visible. It had begun  
far down in the public mind before the prosecutions ceased;  
but it was long before the change became apparent on the surface. It was long before men found utterance for their feelings.</p>  
<p>Persons living at a distance have been accustomed, and are to  
this day, to treat the Salem-witchcraft transaction in the spirit of  
lightsome ridicule, and to make it the subject of jeers and jokes.  
Not so those who have lived on, or near, the fatal scene. They  
have ever regarded it with solemn awe and profound sorrow,  
and shunned the mention, and even the remembrance, of its details. This prevented an immediate expression of feeling, and  
delayed movements in the way of attempting a reparation of the  
wrongs that had been committed. The heart sickened, the lips  
were dumb, at the very thought of those wrongs. Reparation  
was impossible. The dead were beyond its reach. The sorrows  
and anguish of survivors were also beyond its reach. The voice  
of sympathy was felt to be unworthy to obtrude upon sensibilities  
that had been so outraged. The only refuge left for the individuals who had been bereaved, and for the body of the people  
who realized that innocent blood was on all their hands, was in  
humble and soul-subdued silence, and in prayers for forgiveness  
from God and from each other.</p>

</figure>  
</p>  
<p>It was long before the public mind recovered from its paralysis. No one knew what ought to be said or done, the tragedy  
had been so awful. The parties who had acted in it were so  
numerous, and of such standing, including almost all the most  
eminent and honored leaders of the community from the bench,  
the bar, the magistracy, the pulpit, the medical faculty, and in  
fact all classes and descriptions of persons; the mysteries connected with the accusers and confessors; the universal prevalence of the legal, theological, and philosophical theories that  
had led to the proceedings; the utter impossibility of realizing  
or measuring the extent of the calamity; and the general shame  
and horror associated with the subject in all minds; prevented  
any open movement. Then there was the dread of rekindling  
animosities which time was silently subduing, and nothing but  
time could fully extinguish. Slowly, however, the remembrance  
of wrongs was becoming obscured. Neighborhood and business  
relations were gradually reconciling the estranged. Offices of  
civility, courtesy, and good-will were reviving; social and family  
intimacies and connections were taking effect and restoring the  
community to a natural and satisfactory condition. Every day,  
the sentiment was sinking deeper in the public mind, that something was required to be done to avert the displeasure of Heaven  
from a guilty land. But while some were ready to forgive, and  
some had the grace to ask to be forgiven, any general movement in this direction was obstructed by difficulties hard to be  
surmounted.</p>  
<p>The wrongs committed were so remediless, the outrages upon  
right, character, and life, had been so shocking, that it was expecting too much from the ordinary standard of humanity to  
demand a general oblivion. On the other hand, so many had  
been responsible for them, and their promoters embraced such  
a great majority of all the leading classes of society, that it was  
impossible to call them to account. Dr. Bentley describes the  
condition of the community, in some brief and pregnant sentences, characteristic of his peculiar style: &ldquo;As soon as the judges  
ceased to condemn, the people ceased to accuse.... Terror at  
the violence and guilt of the proceedings succeeded instantly to  
the conviction of blind zeal; and what every man had encouraged  
all professed to abhor. Few dared to blame other men, because  
<pb n="470" id="vII470"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2483">  
<figDesc>Page 470.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
few were innocent. The guilt and the shame became the portion  
of the country, while Salem had the infamy of being the place of  
the transactions.... After the public mind became quiet, few  
things were done to disturb it. But a diminished population,  
the injury done to religion, and the distress of the aggrieved,  
were seen and felt with the greatest sorrow.... Every place was  
the subject of some direful tale. Fear haunted every street.  
Melancholy dwelt in silence in every place, after the sun retired.  
Business could not, for some time, recover its former channels;  
and the innocent suffered with the guilty.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>While the subject was felt to be too dark and awful to be  
spoken of, and most men desired to bury it in silence, occasionally  
the slumbering fires would rekindle, and the flames of animosity  
burst forth. The recollection of the part he had acted, and the  
feelings of many towards him in consequence, rendered the  
situation of the sheriff often quite unpleasant; and the resentment  
of some broke out in a shameful demonstration at his death, which  
occurred early in 1697. Mr. English, representing that class who  
had suffered under his official hands in 1692, having a business  
demand upon him, in the shape of a suit for debt, stood ready  
to seize his body after it was prepared for interment, and prevented the funeral at the time. The body was temporarily deposited on the sheriff's own premises. There were, it is probable,  
from time to time, other less noticeable occurrences manifesting  
the long-continued existence of the unhappy state of feeling engendered in 1692. There were really two parties in the community,  
generally both quiescent, but sometimes coming into open collision; the one exasperated by the wrongs they and their friends  
had suffered, the other determined not to allow those who had  
acted in conducting the prosecutions to be called to account for  
what they had done. After the lapse of thirty years, and long  
subsequent to the death of Mr. Noyes, Mr. English was prosecuted for having said that Mr. Noyes had murdered Rebecca  
Nurse and John Procter.</p>  
<p>It has been suggested, that the bearing of the executive officers  
of the law towards the prisoners was often quite harsh. This resulted from the general feeling, in which these officials would have  
been likely to sympathize, of the peculiarly execrable nature of  
the crime charged upon the accused, and from the danger that  
<pb n="471" id="vII471"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2484">  
<figDesc>Page 471.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
might attend the manifestation of any appearance of kindly regard for them. So far as the seizure of goods is considered,  
or the exaction of fees, the conduct of the officials was in conformity with usage and instructions. The system of the administration of the law, compared with our times, was stern, severe,  
and barbarous. The whole tone of society was more unfeeling.  
Philanthropy had not then extended its operations, or directed  
its notice, to the prison. Sheriff Corwin was quite a young man,  
being but twenty-six years of age at the time of his appointment.  
He probably acted under the advice of his relatives and connections on the bench. I think there is no evidence of any particular  
cruelty evinced by him. The arrests, examinations, and imprisonments had taken place under his predecessor, Marshal Herrick,  
who continued in the service as his deputy.</p>  
<p>That individual, indeed, had justly incurred the resentment of  
the sufferers and their friends, by eager zeal in urging on the  
prosecutions, perpetual officiousness, and unwarrantable interference against the prisoners at the preliminary examinations.  
The odium originally attached to the marshal seems to have been  
transferred to his successor, and the whole was laid at the door  
of the sheriff. Marshal Herrick does not appear to have been  
connected with Joseph Herrick, who lived on what is now called  
Cherry Hill, but was a man of an entirely different stamp. He was  
thirty-four years of age, and had not been very long in the country.  
John Dunton speaks of meeting him in Salem, in 1686, and describes him as a &ldquo;very tall, handsome man, very regular and devout  
in his attendance at church, religious without bigotry, and having  
every man's good word.&rdquo; His impatient activity against the  
victims of the witchcraft delusion wrought a great change in the  
condition of this popular and &ldquo;handsome&rdquo; man, as is seen in  
a petition presented by him, Dec. 8, 1692, to &ldquo;His Excellency Sir William Phips, Knight, Captain-general and Governor  
of Their Majesties' Territories and Dominions of Massachusetts  
Bay in New England; and to the Honorable William Stoughton,  
Esq., Deputy-Governor; and to the rest of the Honored Council.&rdquo;  
It begins thus: &ldquo;The petition of your poor servant, George Herrick, most humbly showeth.&rdquo; After recounting his great and  
various services &ldquo;for the term of nine months, as marshal or  
deputy-sheriff in apprehending many prisoners, and conveying  
<pb n="472" id="vII472"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2485">  
<figDesc>Page 472.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
them &ldquo;unto prison and from prison to prison,&rdquo; he complains that  
his whole time had been taken up so that he was incapable of  
getting any thing for the maintenance of his &ldquo;poor family:&rdquo; he  
further states that he had become so impoverished that necessity  
had forced him to lay down his place; and that he must certainly  
come to want, if not in some measure supplied. &ldquo;Therefore I  
humbly beseech Your Honors to take my case and condition so  
far into consideration, that I may have some supply this hard  
winter, that I and my poor children may not be destitute of sustenance, and so inevitably perish; for I have been bred a gentleman,  
and not much used to work, and am become despicable in these  
hard times.&rdquo; He concludes by declaring, that he is not &ldquo;weary  
of serving his king and country,&rdquo; nor very scrupulous as to the  
kind of service; for he promises that &ldquo;if his habitation&rdquo; could  
thereby be &ldquo;graced with plenty in the room of penury, there  
shall be no services too dangerous and difficult, but your poor  
petitioner will gladly accept, and to the best of my power accomplish. I shall wholly lay myself at Your Honorable feet for  
relief.&rdquo; Marshal Herrick died in 1695.</p>  
<p>But, while this feeling was spreading among the people, the  
government were doing their best to check it. There was great  
apprehension, that, if allowed to gather force, it would burst over  
all barriers, that no limit would be put to its demands for the  
restoration of property seized by the officers of the law, and that  
it would wreak vengeance upon all who had been engaged in  
the prosecutions. Under the influence of this fear, the following attempt was made to shield the sheriff of the county from  
prosecutions for damages by those whose relatives had suffered: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">At a Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Assize, and General Jail  
Delivery, held at Ipswich, the fifteenth day of May, anno Domini</hi> 1694.&mdash;  
Present, William Stoughton, Esq., <hi rend="italics">Chief-justice;</hi> Thomas Danforth,  
Esq.; Samuel Sewall, Esq.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;This Court, having adjusted the accounts of George Corwin, Esq.,  
high-sheriff for the county of Essex, do allow the same to be just and  
true; and that there remains a balance due to him, the said Corwin,  
of &pound;67. 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">d.,</hi> which is also allowed unto him; and, pursuant to law,  
this Court doth fully, clearly, and absolutely acquit and discharge him,  
<pb n="473" id="vII473"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2486">  
<figDesc>Page 473.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the said George Corwin, his heirs, executors, and administrators, lands  
and tenements, goods and chattels, of and from all manner of sum or  
sums of money, goods or chattels levied, received, or seized, and of all  
debts, duties, and demands which are or may be charged in his, the  
said Corwin's, accounts, or which may be imposed by reason of the  
sheriff's office, or any thing by him done by virtue thereof, or in  
the execution of the same, from the time he entered into the said  
office, to this Court.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This extraordinary attempt of the Court to close the doors of  
justice beforehand against suits for damages did not seem to  
have any effect; for Mr. English compelled the executors of the  
sheriff to pay over to him &pound;60. 3<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></p>  
<p>At length, the government had to meet the public feeling. A  
proclamation was issued, &ldquo;By the Honorable the Lieutenant, Council, and Assembly of His Majesty's province of the  
Massachusetts Bay, in General Court assembled.&rdquo; It begins thus:  
&ldquo;Whereas the anger of God is not yet turned away, but his hand  
is still stretched out against his people in manifold judgments;&rdquo;  
and, after several specifications of the calamities under which they  
were suffering, and referring to the &ldquo;many days of public and  
solemn&rdquo; addresses made to God, it proceeds: &ldquo;Yet we cannot but  
also fear that there is something still wanting to accompany our  
supplications; and doubtless there are some particular sins which  
God is angry with our Israel for, that have not been duly seen and  
resented by us, about which God expects to be sought, if ever he  
again turn our captivity.&rdquo; Thursday, the fourteenth of the next  
January, was accordingly appointed to be observed as a day of  
prayer and fasting, &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;That so all God's people may offer up fervent supplications unto him,  
that all iniquity may be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this land; that he would show us what we know not, and  
help us, wherein we have done amiss, to do so no more; and especially,  
that, whatever mistakes on either hand have been fallen into, either by  
the body of this people or any orders of men, referring to the late  
tragedy, raised among us by Satan and his instruments, through the  
awful judgment of God, he would humble us therefor, and pardon all  
the errors of his servants and people that desire to love his name;  
that he would remove the rod of the wicked from off the lot of the  
<pb n="474" id="vII474"/>

righteous; that he would bring in the American heathen, and cause  
them to hear and obey his voice.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Given at Boston, Dec. 17, 1696, in the eighth year of His Majesty reign. <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac Addington,</hi> <hi rend="italics">Secretary.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The jury had acted in conformity with their obligations and  
honest convictions of duty in bringing in their verdicts. They had  
sworn to decide according to the law and the evidence. The law  
under which they were required to act was laid down with absolute positiveness by the Court. They were bound to receive it,  
and to take and weigh the evidence that was admitted; and to their  
minds it was clear, decisive, and overwhelming, offered by persons  
of good character, and confirmed by a great number of confessions. If it had been within their province, as it always is declared not to be, to discuss the general principles, and sit in  
judgment on the particular penalties of law, it would not have  
altered the case; for, at that time, not only the common people,  
but the wisest philosophers, supported the interpretation of the  
law that acknowledged the existence of witchcraft, and its sanction  
that visited it with death.</p>  
<p>Notwithstanding all this, however, so tender and sensitive were  
the consciences of the jurors, that they signed and circulated the  
following humble and solemn declaration of regret for the part  
they had borne in the trials. As the publication of this paper was  
highly honorable to those who signed it, and cannot but be contemplated with satisfaction by all their descendants, I will repeat  
their names: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;We whose names are underwritten, being in the year 1692 called  
to serve as jurors in court at Salem, on trial of many who were by  
some suspected guilty of doing acts of witchcraft upon the bodies of  
sundry persons, &mdash; we confess that we ourselves were not capable to  
understand, nor able to withstand, the mysterious delusions of the  
powers of darkness and Prince of the air, but were, for want of knowledge in ourselves and better information from others, prevailed with to  
take up with such evidence against the accused as, on further consideration and better information, we justly fear was insufficient for the  
touching the lives of any (Deut. xvii. 6), whereby we fear we have  
been instrumental, with others, though ignorantly and unwittingly, to  
bring upon ourselves and this people of the Lord the guilt of innocent  
blood; which sin the Lord saith in Scripture he would not pardon  
<pb n="475" id="vII475"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2488">  
<figDesc>Page 475.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
(2 Kings xxiv. 4), &mdash; that is, we suppose, in regard of his temporal  
judgments. We do therefore hereby signify to all in general, and to  
the surviving sufferers in special, our deep sense of, and sorrow for,  
our errors in acting on such evidence to the condemning of any person; and do hereby declare, that we justly fear that we were sadly  
deluded and mistaken, &mdash; for which we are much disquieted and distressed in our minds, and do therefore humbly beg forgiveness, first,  
of God, for Christ's sake, for this our error, and pray that God would  
not impute the guilt of it to ourselves nor others: and we also pray  
that we may be considered candidly and aright by the living sufferers,  
as being then under the power of a strong and general delusion, utterly  
unacquainted with, and not experienced in, matters of that nature.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly  
offended; and do declare, according to our present minds, we would  
none of us do such things again, on such grounds, for the whole  
world, &mdash; praying you to accept of this in way of satisfaction for our  
offence, and that you would bless the inheritance of the Lord, that he  
may be entreated for the land.</p>

<p>In 1697, Rev. John Hale, of Beverly, published a work on the  
subject of the witchcraft persecutions, in which he gives the reasons  
which led him to the conclusion that there was error at the foundation of the proceedings. The following extract shows that he  
took a rational view of the subject: &mdash;</p>

1 Cor. xiii., Col. iii. 14, and many other places.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> III. &mdash; The number of the afflicted by Satan daily increased,  
till about fifty persons were thus vexed by the Devil. This gave just  
ground to suspect some mistake.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> IV. &mdash; It was considerable, that nineteen were executed,  
and all denied the crime to the death; and some of them were knowing  
persons, and had before this been accounted blameless livers. And it  
is not to be imagined but that, if all had been guilty, some would have  
had so much tenderness as to seek mercy for their souls in the way of  
confession, and sorrow for such a sin.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> V. &mdash; When this prosecution ceased, the Lord so chained  
up Satan, that the afflicted grew presently well: the accused are  
generally quiet, and for five years since we have no such molestation  
by them.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Such reasonings as these found their way into the minds of the  
whole community; and it became the melancholy conviction of all  
candid and considerate persons that innocent blood had been shed.  
Standing where we do, with the lights that surround us, we look  
back upon the whole scene as an awful perversion of justice,  
reason, and truth.</p>  
<p>On the 13th of June, 1700, Abigail Faulkner presented a well memorial to the General Court, in which she says that  
her pardon &ldquo;so far had its effect, as that I am yet suffered to live,  
but this only as a malefactor convict upon record of the most  
heinous crimes that mankind can be supposed to be guilty of;&rdquo; and  
prays for &ldquo;the defacing of the record&rdquo; against her. She claims it  
as no more than a simple act of justice; stating that the evidence  
against her was wholly confined to the &ldquo;afflicted, who pretended to  
see me by their spectral sight, and not with their bodily eyes.&rdquo;  
That &ldquo;the jury (upon only their testimony) brought me in `Guilty,'  
and the sentence of death was passed upon me;&rdquo; and that it had  
been decided that such testimony was of no value. The House of  
Representatives felt the force of her appeal, and voted that &ldquo;the  
prayer of the petitioner be granted.&rdquo; The council declined to concur, but addressed &ldquo;His Excellency to grant the petitioner His  
Majesty's gracious pardon; and His Excellency expressed His  
readiness to grant the same.&rdquo; Some adverse influence, it seemed,  
prevailed to prevent it.</p>  
<p>On the 18th of March, 1702, another petition was presented to  
<pb n="477" id="vII477"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2490">  
<figDesc>Page 477.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the General Court, by persons of Andover, Salcm Village, and  
Topsfield, who had suffered imprisonment and condemnation,  
and by the relations of others who had been condemned and  
executed on the testimony, as they say, of &ldquo;possessed persons,&rdquo;  
to this effect: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Your petitioners being dissatisfied and grieved that (besides what  
the condemned persons have suffered in their persons and estates)  
their names are exposed to infamy and reproach, while their trial and  
condemnation stands upon public record, we therefore humbly pray  
this honored Court that something may be publicly done to take off  
infamy from the names and memory of those who have suffered as  
aforesaid, that none of their surviving relations nor their posterity may  
suffer reproach on that account.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>[Signed by Francis Faulkner, Isaac Easty, Thorndike Procter, and  
eighteen others.]</p>  
<p>On the 20th of July, in answer to the foregoing petitions, a  
bill was ordered by the House of Representatives to be drawn up,  
forbidding in future such procedures, as in the witchcraft trials  
of 1692; declaring that &ldquo;no spectre evidence may hereafter be  
accounted valid or sufficient to take away the life or good name  
of any person or persons within this province, and that the infamy  
and reproach cast on the names and posterity of said accused and  
condemned persons may in some measure be rolled away.&rdquo; The  
council concurred with an additional clause, to acquit all condemned persons &ldquo;of the penalties to which they are liable upon  
the convictions and judgments in the courts, and estate them in  
their just credit and reputation, as if no such judgment had been  
had.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>This petition was re-enforced by an &ldquo;address&rdquo; to the General  
Court, dated July 8, 1703, by several ministers of the county  
of Essex. They speak of the accusers in the witchcraft trials as  
&ldquo;young persons under diabolical molestations,&rdquo; and express this  
sentiment: &ldquo;There is great reason to fear that innocent persons  
then suffered, and that God may have a controversy with the land  
upon that account.&rdquo; They earnestly beg that the prayer of the  
petitioners, lately presented, may be granted. This petition was  
signed by Thomas Barnard, of Andover; Joseph Green, of Salem  
Village; William Hubbard, John Wise, John Rogers, and Jabez  
<pb n="478" id="vII478"/>

Fitch, of Ipswich; Benjamin Rolfe, of Haverhill; Samuel Cheever,  
of Marblehead; Joseph Gerrish, of Wenham; Joseph Capen, of  
Topsfield; Zechariah Symmes, of Bradford; and Thomas Symmes,  
of Boxford. Francis Dane, of Andover, had died six years before.  
John Hale, of Beverly, had died three years before. The great  
age of John Higginson, of Salem, &mdash; eighty-seven years, &mdash; probably prevented the papers being handed to him. It is observable,  
that Nicholas Noyes, his colleague, is not among the signers.</p>  
<p>What prevented action, we do not know; but nothing was  
done. Six years afterwards, on the 25th of May, 1709, an &ldquo;humble address&rdquo; was presented to the General Court by certain  
inhabitants of the province, some of whom &ldquo;had their near relations, either parents or others, who suffered death in the dark  
and doleful times that passed over this province in 1692;&rdquo; and  
others &ldquo;who themselves, or some of their relations, were imprisoned, impaired and blasted in their reputations and estates by reason of the same.&rdquo; They pray for the passage of a &ldquo;suitable act&rdquo;  
to restore the reputations of the sufferers, and to make some remuneration &ldquo;as to what they have been damnified in their estates  
thereby.&rdquo; This paper was signed by Philip English and twenty others. Philip English gave in an account in detail of what  
articles were seized and carried away, at the time of his arrest,  
from four of his warehouses, his wharf, and shop-house, besides  
the expenses incurred in prison, and in escaping from it. It  
appears by this statement, that he and his wife were nine weeks in  
jail at Salem and Boston. Nothing was done at this session.  
The next year, Sept. 12, 1710, Isaac Easty presented a strong  
memorial to the General Court in reference to his case. He calls  
for some remuneration. In speaking of the arrest and execution  
of his &ldquo;beloved wife,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;my sorrow and trouble of heart in  
being deprived of her in such a manner, which this world can  
never make me any compensation for.&rdquo; At the same time, the  
daughters of Elizabeth How, the son of Sarah Wildes, the heirs of  
Mary Bradbury, Edward Bishop and his wife Sarah, sent in  
severally similar petitions, &mdash; all in earnest and forcible language.  
Charles, one of the sons of George Burroughs, presented the case  
of his &ldquo;dear and honored father;&rdquo; declaring that his innocence of  
the crime of which he was accused, and his excellence of character,  
were shown in &ldquo;his careful catechising his children, and upholding  
<pb n="479" id="vII479"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2492">  
<figDesc>Page 479.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
religion in his family, and by his solemn and savory written instructions from prison.&rdquo; He describes in affecting details the  
condition in which his father's family of little children was left at  
his death. One of Mr. Burroughs's daughters, upon being required to sign a paper in reference to compensation, expresses her  
distress of mind in these words: &ldquo;Every discourse on this melancholy subject doth but give a fresh wound to my bleeding heart.  
I desire to sit down in silence.&rdquo; John Moulton, in behalf of the  
family of Giles Corey, says that they &ldquo;cannot sufficiently express  
their grief&rdquo; for the death, in such a manner, of &ldquo;their honored  
father and mother.&rdquo; Samuel Nurse, in behalf of his brothers and  
sisters, says that their &ldquo;honored and dear mother had led a  
blameless life from her youth up.... Her name and the name of  
her posterity lies under reproach, the removing of which reproach  
is the principal thing wherein we desire restitution. And, as we  
know not how to express our loss of such a mother in such a way,  
so we know not how to compute our charge, but leave it to the  
judgment of others, and shall not be critical.&rdquo; He distinctly intimates, that they do not wish any money to be paid them, unless  
&ldquo;the attainder is taken off.&rdquo; Many other petitions were presented  
by the families of those who suffered, all in the same spirit; and  
several besides the Nurses insisted mainly upon the &ldquo;taking off  
the attainder.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>The General Court, on the 17th of October, 1710, passed an  
act, that &ldquo;the several convictions, judgments, and attainders be,  
and hereby are, reversed, and declared to be null and void.&rdquo; In  
simple justice, they ought to have extended the act to all who had  
suffered; but they confined its effect to those in reference to  
whom petitions had been presented. The families of some of  
them had disappeared, or may not have had notice of what was  
going on; so that the sentence which the Government acknowledged  
to have been unjust remains to this day unreversed against the  
names and memory of Bridget Bishop, Susanna Martin, Alice  
Parker, Ann Pudeator, Wilmot Read, and Margaret Scott. The  
stain on the records of the Commonwealth has never been fully  
effaced. What caused this dilatory and halting course on the part  
of the Government, and who was responsible for it, cannot be  
ascertained. Since the presentation of Abigail Faulkner's petition  
in 1700, the Legislature, in the popular branch at least, and the

</figure>  
Governor, appear to have been inclined to act favorably in the premises; but some power blocked the way. There is some reason to  
conjecture that it was the influence of the home government. Its  
consent to have the prosecutions suspended, in 1692, was not very  
cordial, but, while it approved of &ldquo;care and circumspection therein,&rdquo; expressed reluctance to allow any &ldquo;impediment to the ordinary course of justice.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>On the 17th of December, 1711, Governor Dudley issued his  
warrant for the purpose of carrying out a vote of the &ldquo;General  
Assembly,&rdquo; &ldquo;by and with the advice and consent of Her Majesty Council,&rdquo; to pay &ldquo;the sum of &pound;578. 12<hi rend="italics">s.</hi>&rdquo; to &ldquo;such persons  
as are living, and to those that legally represent them that are  
dead;&rdquo; which sum was divided as follows: &mdash;</p>

<p>The distribution, as above, according to the evidence as it has  
come down to us, is as unjust and absurd as the smallness of the

<figure entity="Uphv2494">  
<figDesc>Page 481.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
amount, and the long delay before it was ordered, are discreditable to the province. One of the larger sums was allowed to  
William Good, while he clearly deserved nothing, as he was an  
adverse witness in the examination of his wife, and did what he  
could to promote the prosecution against her. He did not, it is  
true, swear that he believed her to be a witch; but what he said  
tended to prejudice the magistrates and the public against her.  
Benjamin Putnam acted as his attorney, and received the money  
for him. Good was a retainer and dependant of that branch of  
the Putnam family; and its influence gave him so large a proportionate amount, and not the reason or equity of the case. More  
was allowed to Abigail Hobbs, a very malignant witness against  
the prisoners, than to the families of several who were executed.  
Nearly twice as much was allowed for Abigail Faulkner, who was  
pardoned, as for Elizabeth How, who was executed. The sums  
allowed in the cases of Parker, Carrier, and Foster, were shamefully small. The public mind evidently was not satisfied; and the  
Legislature were pressed for a half-century to make more adequate compensation, and thereby vindicate the sentiment of justice, and redeem the honor of the province.</p>  
<p>On the 8th of December, 1738, Major Samuel Sewall, a son of  
the Judge, introduced an order in the House of Representatives  
for the appointment of a committee to get information relating to  
&ldquo;the circumstances of the persons and families who suffered in the  
calamity of the times in and about the year 1692.&rdquo; Major Sewall  
entered into the matter with great zeal. The House unanimously  
passed the order. He was chairman of the committee; and, on the  
9th of December, wrote to his cousin Mitchel Sewall in Salem, son  
of Stephen, earnestly requesting him and John Higginson, Esq.,  
to aid in accomplishing the object. The following is an extract  
from a speech delivered by Governor Belcher to both Houses of  
the Legislature, Nov. 22, 1740. It is honorable to his memory.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The Legislature have often honored themselves in a kind and  
generous remembrance of such families and of the posterity of such as  
have been sufferers, either in their persons or estates, for or by the  
Government, of which the public records will give you many instances.  
I should therefore be glad there might be a committee appointed by  
this Court to inquire into the sufferings of the people called Quakers,  
in the early days of this country, as also into the descendants of such  
<pb n="482" id="vII482"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2495">  
<figDesc>Page 482.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
families as were in a manner ruined in the mistaken management of  
the terrible affair called witchcraft. I really think there is something  
incumbent on this Government to be done for relieving the estates and  
reputations of the posterities of the unhappy families that so suffered;  
and the doing it, though so long afterwards, would doubtless be acceptable to Almighty God, and would reflect honor upon the present  
Legislature.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>On the 31st of May, 1749, the heirs of George Burroughs addressed a petition to Governor Shirley and the General Court, setting forth &ldquo;the unparalleled persecutions and sufferings&rdquo; of their  
ancestor, and praying for &ldquo;some recompense from this Court for  
the losses thereby sustained by his family.&rdquo; It was referred to a  
committee of both Houses. The next year, the petitioners sent  
a memorial to Governor Spencer Phips and the General Court,  
stating, that &ldquo;it hath fell out, that the Hon. Mr. Danforth,  
chairman of the said committee, had not, as yet, called them together so much as once to act thereon, even to this day, as some of  
the honorable committee themselves were pleased, with real concern, to signify to your said petitioners.&rdquo; The House immediately  
passed this order: &ldquo;That the committee within referred to be  
directed to sit forthwith, consider the petition to them committed,  
and report as soon as may be.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>All that I have been able to find, as the result of these long and long-protracted movements, is a statement of Dr.  
Bentley, that the heirs of Philip English received two hundred  
pounds. He does not say when the act to this effect was passed.  
Perhaps some general measure of the kind was adopted, the record of which I have failed to meet. The engrossing interest of  
the then pending French war, and of the vehement dissensions  
that led to the Revolution, probably prevented any further attention to this subject, after the middle of the last century.</p>  
<p>It is apparent from the foregoing statements and records, that  
while many individuals, the people generally, and finally Governor  
Belcher and the House of Representatives emphatically, did what  
they could, there was an influence that prevailed to prevent for a  
long time, if not for ever, any action of the province to satisfy the  
demands made by justice and the honor of the country in repairing the great wrongs committed by the legislative, executive, and  
judicial branches of the Government in 1692. The only bodies  
<pb n="483" id="vII483"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2496">  
<figDesc>Page 483.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of men who fully came up to their duty on the occasion were the  
clergy of the county, and, as will appear, the church at Salem  
Village.</p>  
<p>What was done by the First Church in Salem is shown in the  
following extract from its records: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;March 2, 1712. &mdash; After the sacrament, a church-meeting was appointed to be at the teacher's house, at two of the clock in the afternoon, on the sixth of the month, being Thursday: on which day they  
accordingly met to consider of the several following particulars propounded to them by the teacher; viz.: &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;1. Whether the record of the excommunication of our Sister Nurse  
(all things considered) may not be erased and blotted out. The result  
of which consideration was, That whereas, on July 3d, 1692, it was proposed by the Elders, and consented to by an unanimous vote of the  
church, that our Sister Nurse should be excommunicated, she being  
convicted of witchcraft by the Court, and she was accordingly excommunicated, since which the General Court having taken off the  
attainder, and the testimony on which she was convicted being not  
now so satisfactory to ourselves and others as it was generally in that  
hour of darkness and temptation; and we being solicited by her son,  
Mr. Samuel Nurse, to erase and blot out of the church records the  
sentence of her excommunication, &mdash; this church, having the matter  
proposed to them by the teacher, and having seriously considered it,  
doth consent that the record of our Sister Nurse's excommunication  
be accordingly erased and blotted out, that it may no longer be a  
reproach to her memory, and an occasion of grief to her children.  
Humbly requesting that the merciful God would pardon whatsoever  
sin, error, or mistake was in the application of that censure and of  
that whole affair, through our merciful High-priest, who knoweth how  
to have compassion on the ignorant, and those that are out of the  
way.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;2. It was proposed whether the sentence of excommunication  
against our Brother Giles Corey (all things considered) may not be  
erased and blotted out. The result was, That whereas, on Sept. 18,  
1692, it was considered by the church, that our Brother Giles Corey  
stood accused of and indicted for the sin of witchcraft, and that he  
had obstinately refused to plead, and so threw himself on certain  
death. It was agreed by the vote of the church, that he should be  
excommunicated for it; and accordingly he was excommunicated.  
Yet the church, having now testimony in his behalf, that, before his  
death, he did bitterly repent of his obstinate refusal to plead in defence  
<pb n="484" id="vII484"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2497">  
<figDesc>Page 484.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of his life, do consent that the sentence of his excommunication be  
erased and blotted out.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>It will be noticed that these proceedings were not had at a  
regular public meeting, but at a private meeting of the church, on  
a week-day afternoon, at the teacher's house. The motives that  
led to them were a disposition to comply with the act of the  
General Court, and the solicitations of Mr. Samuel Nurse, rather  
than a profound sense of wrong done to a venerable member of  
their own body, who had claims upon their protection as such.  
The language of the record does not frankly admit absolutely that  
there was sin, error, or mistake, but requests forgiveness for  
whatsoever there may have been. The character of Rebecca  
Nurse, and the outrageous treatment she had received from that  
church, in the method arranged for her excommunication, demanded something more than these hypothetical expressions, with  
such a preamble.</p>  
<p>The statement made in the vote about Corey is, on its face, a  
misrepresentation. From the nature of the proceeding by which  
he was destroyed, it was in his power, at any moment, if he  
&ldquo;repented of his obstinate refusal to plead,&rdquo; by saying so, to be  
instantly released from the pressure that was crushing him. The  
only design of the torture was to make him bring it to an end by  
&ldquo;answering&rdquo; guilty, or not guilty. Somebody fabricated the  
slander that Corey's resolution broke down under his agonies, and  
that he bitterly repented; and Mr. Noyes put the foolish scandal  
upon the records of the church.</p>  
<p>The date of this transaction is disreputable to the people of  
Salem. Twenty years had been suffered to elapse, and a great  
outrage allowed to remain unacknowledged and unrepented. The  
credit of doing what was done at last probably belongs to the Rev.  
George Corwin. His call to the ministry, as colleague with Mr.  
Noyes, had just been consummated. The introduction of a new  
minister heralded a new policy, and the proceedings have the  
appearance of growing out of the kindly and auspicious feelings  
which generally attend and welcome such an era.</p>  
<p>The Rev. George, son of Jonathan Corwin, was born May  
21, 1683, and graduated at Harvard College in 1701. Mr.  
Barnard, of Marblehead, describes his character: &ldquo;The spirit of  
<pb n="485" id="vII485"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2498">  
<figDesc>Page 485.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
early devotion, accompanied with a natural freedom of thought  
and easy elocution, a quick invention, a solid judgment, and a  
tenacious memory, laid the foundation of a good preacher; to  
which his acquired literature, his great reading, hard studies, deep  
meditation, and close walk with God, rendered him an able and  
faithful minister of the New Testament.&rdquo; The records of the  
First Church, in noticing his death, thus speak of him: &ldquo;He was  
highly esteemed in his life, and very deservedly lamented at his  
death; having been very eminent for his early improvement in  
learning and piety, his singular abilities and great labors, his  
remarkable zeal and faithfulness. He was a great benefactor to  
our poor.&rdquo; Those bearing the name of Curwen among us are his  
descendants. He died Nov. 23, 1717.</p>  
<p>The Rev. Nicholas Noyes died Dec. 13, 1717. He was a  
person of superior talents and learning. He published, with the  
sermon preached by Cotton Mather on the occasion, a poem on  
the death of his venerable colleague, Mr. Higginson, in 1708; and  
also a poem on the death of Rev. Joseph Green, in 1715. Although an amiable and benevolent man in other respects, it cannot be denied that he was misled by his errors and his temperament into the most violent course in the witchcraft prosecutions;  
and it is to be feared that his feelings were never wholly rectified  
in reference to that transaction.</p>  
<p>Jonathan, the father of the Rev. George Corwin, and whose  
part as a magistrate and judge in the examinations and trials  
of 1692 has been seen, died on the 9th of July, 1718, seventy years of age.</p>  
<p>It only remains to record the course of the village church and  
people in reference to the events of 1692. After six persons, including Rebecca Nurse, had suffered death; and while five others,  
George Burroughs, John Procter, John Willard, George Jacobs,  
and Martha Carrier, were awaiting their execution, which was to  
take place on the coming Friday, Aug. 19, &mdash; the facts, related as  
follows by Mr. Parris in his record-book, occurred: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Sabbath-day, 14th August, 1692. &mdash; The church was stayed after  
the congregation was dismissed, and the pastor spake to the church  
after this manner: &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;`Brethren, you may all have taken notice, that, several sacrament  
days past, our brother Peter Cloyse, and Samuel Nurse and his wife,  
<pb n="486" id="vII486"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2499">  
<figDesc>Page 486.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and John Tarbell and his wife, have absented from communion with  
us at the Lord's Table, yea, have very rarely, except our brother  
Samuel Nurse, been with us in common public worship: now, it is  
needful that the church send some persons to them to know the  
reason of their absence. Therefore, if you be so minded, express  
yourselves.'</p>  
<p>&ldquo;None objected. But a general or universal vote, after some discourse, passed, that Brother Nathaniel Putnam and the two deacons  
should join with the pastor to discourse with the said absenters  
about it.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;31st August. &mdash; Brother Tarbell proves sick, unmeet for discourse;  
Brother Cloyse hard to be found at home, being often with his wife in  
prison at Ipswich for witchcraft; and Brother Nurse, and sometimes his  
wife, attends our public meeting, and he the sacrament, 11th September, 1692: upon all which we choose to wait further.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>When it is remembered that the individuals aimed at all belonged  
to the family of Rebecca Nurse, whose execution had taken place  
three weeks before under circumstances with which Mr. Parris  
had been so prominently and responsibly connected, this proceeding must be felt by every person of ordinary human sensibilities  
to have been cruel, barbarous, and unnatural. Parris made the  
entry in his book, as he often did, some time after the transaction,  
as the inserted date of Sept. 11, shows. What his object was  
in commencing disciplinary treatment of this distressed family is  
not certain. It may be that he was preparing to get up such a  
feeling against them as would make it safe to have the &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo;  
cry out upon some of them. Or it may be that he wished to get  
them out of his church, to avoid the possibility of their proceeding  
against him, by ecclesiastical methods, at some future day. He  
could not, however, bring his church to continue the process.  
This is the first indication that the brethren were no longer to be  
relied on by him to go all lengths, and that some remnants of  
good feeling and good sense were to be found among them.</p>  
<p>But Mr. Parris was determined not to allow the public feeling  
against persons charged with witchcraft to subside, if he could help  
it; and he made one more effort to renew the vehemence of the  
prosecutions. He prepared and preached two sermons, on the  
11th of September, from the text, Rev. xvii. 14: &ldquo;These shall make  
war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is  
<pb n="487" id="vII487"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2500">  
<figDesc>Page 487.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are  
called and chosen and faithful.&rdquo; They are entitled, &ldquo;The  
Devil and his instruments will be warring against Christ and his  
followers.&rdquo; this note is added, &ldquo;After the condemnation of six  
witches at a court at Salem, one of the witches, viz., Martha  
Corey, in full communion with our church.&rdquo; The following is a  
portion of &ldquo;the improvement&rdquo; in the application of these discourses: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;It may serve to reprove such as seem to be so amazed at the war  
the Devil has raised amongst us by wizards and witches, against the  
Lamb and his followers, that they altogether deny it. If ever there  
were witches, men and women in covenant with the Devil, here are  
multitudes in New England. Nor is it so strange a thing that there  
should be such; no, nor that some church-members should be such.  
Pious Bishop Hall saith, `The Devil's prevalency in this age is most  
clear in the marvellous number of witches abounding in all places.  
Now hundreds (says he) are discovered in one shire; and, if fame  
deceive us not, in a village of fourteen houses in the north are found  
so many of this damned brood. Heretofore, only barbarous deserts  
had them; but now the civilized and religious parts are frequently  
pestered with them. Heretofore, some silly, ignorant old woman, &amp;c.;  
but now we have known those of both sexes who professed much  
knowledge, holiness, and devotion, drawn into this damnable practice.&rdquo;'</p></q>  
<p>The foregoing extract is important as showing that some persons at the village had begun to express their disbelief of the  
witchcraft doctrine of Mr. Parris, &ldquo;altogether denying it.&rdquo; The  
title and drift of the sermons in connection with the date, and his  
proceedings, the month before, against Samuel Nurse, Tarbell,  
and Cloyse, members of his church, give color to the idea that he  
was designing to have them &ldquo;cried out&rdquo; against, and thus disposed of. It is a noticeable fact, that, about this time, Cotton  
Mather was also laying his plans for a renewal, or rather continuance, of witchcraft prosecutions. Nine days after these sermons  
were preached by Parris, Mather wrote the following letter to  
Stephen Sewall of Salem: &mdash;</p>

<p>But that I may be the more capable to assist in lifting up a standard against the infernal enemy, I must renew my most importunate  
request, that you would please quickly to perform what you kindly  
promised, of giving me a narrative of the evidences given in at the  
trials of half a dozen, or if you please a dozen, of the principal witches  
that have been condemned. I know 'twill cost you some time; but;  
when you are sensible of the benefit that will follow, I know you will  
not think much of that cost; and my own willingness to expose myself  
unto the utmost for the defence of my friends with you makes me  
presume to plead something of merit to be considered.</p>  
<p>I shall be content, if you draw up the desired narrative by way  
of letter to me; or, at least, let it not come without a letter, wherein  
you shall, if you can, intimate over again what you have sometimes  
told me of the awe which is upon the hearts of your juries, with... unto the validity of the spectral evidences.</p>  
<p>Please also to... some of your observations about the confessors

preternatural in the witchcrafts, and whatever else you may account

I mentioned in my last words, yet I am willing, that, when you write,  
you should imagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate

and when you have so knocked me down, in a spectre so unlike me,  
you will enable me to box it about among my neighbors, till it come &mdash;

<p>In order to understand the character and aim of this letter, it  
will be necessary to consider its date. It was written Sept. 20,  
1692. On the 19th of August, but one month before, Dr. Mather  
<pb n="489" id="vII489"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2502">  
<figDesc>Page 489.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
was acting a conspicuous part under the gallows at Witch-hill, at  
the execution of Mr. Burroughs and four others, increasing the  
power of the awful delusion, and inflaming the passions of the people. On the 9th of September, six more miserable creatures received sentence of death. On the 17th of September, nine more  
received sentence of death. On the 17th of September, Giles Cory  
was crushed to death. And, on the 22d of September, eight were  
executed. These were the last that suffered death. The letter,  
therefore, was written while the horrors of the transaction were at  
their height, and by a person who had himself been a witness of  
them, and whose &ldquo;good hap&rdquo; it had been to &ldquo;do some little service&rdquo; in promoting them. The object of the writer is declared to  
be, that he might be &ldquo;more capable to assist in lifting up a standard against the infernal enemy.&rdquo; The literal meaning of this  
expression is, that he might be enabled to get up another witchcraft delusion under his own special management and control.  
Can any thing be imagined more artful and dishonest than the  
plan he had contrived to keep himself out of sight in all the operations necessary to accomplish his purpose? &ldquo;Nay, though I will  
never lay aside the character which I mentioned in my last words,  
yet I am willing, that, when you write, you should imagine me as  
obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate as any among us: address me as one that believed nothing reasonable; and when you  
have so knocked me down, in a spectre so unlike me, you will  
enable me to box it about among my neighbors, till it come &mdash; I  
know not where at last.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Upon obtaining the document requisite to the fulfilment of his  
design, he did &ldquo;box it about&rdquo; so effectually among his neighbors,  
that he succeeded that next summer in getting up a wonderful  
case of witchcraft, in the person of one Margaret Rule, a member  
of his congregation in Boston. Dr. Mather published an account  
of her long-continued fastings, even unto the ninth day, and of the  
incredible sufferings she endured from the &ldquo;infernal enemy.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;She was thrown,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;into such exorbitant convulsions as  
were astonishing to the spectators in general. They that could  
behold the doleful condition of the poor family without sensible  
compassions might have entrails, indeed, but I am sure they  
could have no true bowels in them.&rdquo; So far was he successful in  
spreading the delusion, that he prevailed upon six men to testify  
<pb n="490" id="vII490"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2503">  
<figDesc>Page 490.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
that they had seen Margaret Rule lifted bodily from her bed, and  
raised by an invisible power &ldquo;so as to touch the garret floor;&rdquo;  
that she was entirely removed from the bed or any other material  
support; that she continued suspended for several minutes; and  
that a strong man, assisted by several other persons, could not  
effectually resist the mysterious force that lifted her up, and  
poised her aloft in the air! The people of Boston were saved  
from the horrors intended to be brought upon them by this dark  
and deep-laid plot, by the activity, courage, and discernment of  
Calef and others, who distrusted Dr. Mather, and, by watching  
his movements, exposed the imposture, and overthrew the whole  
design.</p>  
<p>Mr. Parris does not appear to have produced much effect by  
his sermons. The people had suffered enough from the &ldquo;war  
between the Devil and the Lamb,&rdquo; as he and Mather had conducted it; and it could not be renewed.</p>  
<p>Immediately upon the termination of the witchcraft proceedings, the controversy between Mr. Parris and the congregation,  
or the inhabitants, as they were called, of the village, was renewed,  
with earnest resolution on their part to get rid of him. The parish  
neglected and refused to raise the means for paying his salary;  
and a majority of the voters, in the meetings of the &ldquo;inhabitants,&rdquo;  
vigilantly resisted all attempts in his favor. The church was still  
completely under his influence; and, as has been stated in the  
First Part, he made use of that body to institute a suit against  
the people. The court and magistrates were wholly in his favor,  
and peremptorily ordered the appointment, by the people, of a  
new committee. The inhabitants complied with the order by the  
election of a new committee, but took care to have it composed  
exclusively of men opposed to Mr. Parris; and he found himself  
no better off than before. He concluded not to employ his church  
any longer as a principal agent in his lawsuit against the parish;  
but used it for another purpose.</p>  
<p>After the explosion of the witchcraft delusion, the relations of  
parties became entirely changed. The prosecutors at the trials  
were put on the defensive, and felt themselves in peril. Parris  
saw his danger, and, with characteristic courage and fertility of  
resources, prepared to defend himself, and carry the war upon  
any quarter from which an attack might be apprehended. He  
<pb n="491" id="vII491"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2504">  
<figDesc>Page 491.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
continued, on his own responsibility, to prosecute, in court, his  
suit against the parish, and in his usual trenchant style. As the  
law then was, a minister, in a controversy with his parish, had a  
secure advantage, and absolutely commanded the situation, if his  
church were with him. From the time of his settlement, Parris  
had shaped his policy on this basis. He had sought to make his  
church an impregnable fortress against his opponents. But, to be  
impregnable, it was necessary that there should be no enemies  
within it. A few disaffected brethren could at any time demand,  
and have a claim to, a mutual council; and Mr. Parris knew,  
that, before the investigations of such a council, his actions in the  
witchcraft prosecutions could not stand. This perhaps suggested  
his movements, in August, 1692, against Samuel Nurse, John Tarbell, and Peter Cloyse. He did not at that time succeed in  
getting rid of them; and they remained in the church, and, with  
the exception of Cloyse, in the village. They might at any time  
take the steps that would lead to a mutual council; and Mr. Parris  
was determined, at all events, to prevent that. It was evident  
that the members of that family would insist upon satisfaction  
being given them, in and through the church, for the wrongs he  
had done them. Although, in the absence of Cloyse, but two in  
number, there was danger that sympathy for them might reach  
others of the brethren. Thomas Wilkins, a member in good standing, son of old Bray Wilkins, and a connection of John Willard,  
an intelligent and resolute man, had already joined them. Parris  
felt that others might follow, and that whatever could be done to  
counteract them must be done quickly. He accordingly initiated  
proceedings in his church to rid himself of them, if not by excommunication, at least by getting them under discipline, so as to  
prevent the possibility of their dealing with him.</p>  
<p>This led to one of the most remarkable passages of the kind  
in the annals of the New-England churches. It is narrated in  
detail by Mr. Parris, in his church record-book. It would not  
be easy to find anywhere an example of greater skill, wariness,  
or ability in a conflict of this sort. On the one side is Mr. Parris,  
backed by his church and the magistrates, and aided, it is probable, by Mr. Noyes; on the other, three husbandmen. They had  
no known backers or advisers; and, at frequent stages of the  
fencing match, had to parry or strike, without time to consult any  
<pb n="492" id="vII492"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2505">  
<figDesc>Page 492.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
one. Mr. Parris was ingenious, quick, a great strategist, and not  
over-scrupulous as to the use of his weapons. Nurse, Tarbell,  
and Wilkins were cautious, cool, steady, and persistent. Of  
course, they were wholly inexperienced in such things, and liable  
to make wrong moves, or to be driven or drawn to untenable  
ground. But they will not be found, I think, to have taken a false  
step from beginning to end. Their line of action was extremely  
narrow. It was necessary to avoid all personalities, and every  
appearance of passion or excitement; to make no charge against  
Mr. Parris that could touch the church, as such, or reflect upon the  
courts, magistrates, or any others that had taken part in the prosecutions. It was necessary to avoid putting any thing into writing,  
with their names attached, which could in any way be tortured  
into a libel. Parris lets fall expressions which show that he was  
on the watch for something of the kind to seize upon, to transfer  
the movement from the church to the courts. Entirely unaccustomed to public speaking, these three farmers had to meet assemblages composed of their opponents, and much wrought up against  
them; to make statements, and respond to interrogatories and  
propositions, the full and ultimate bearing of which was not always  
apparent: any unguarded expression might be fatal to their cause.  
Their safety depended upon using the right word at the right time  
and in the right manner, and in withholding the statement of their  
grievances, in adequate force of language, until they were under  
the shelter of a council. If, during the long-protracted conferences and communications, they had tripped at any point, allowed  
a phrase or syllable to escape which might be made the ground of  
discipline or censure, all would be lost; for Parris could not be  
reached but through a council, and a council could not even  
be asked for except by brethren in full and clear standing. It  
was often attempted to ensnare them into making charges against  
the church; but they kept their eye on Parris, and, as they told  
him more than once in the presence of the whole body of the  
people, on him alone. Limited as the ground was on which they  
could stand, they held it steadfastly, and finally drove him from  
his stronghold.</p>  
<p>On the first movement of Mr. Parris offensively upon them,  
they commenced their movement upon him. The method by  
which alone they could proceed, according to ecclesiastical law  
<pb n="493" id="vII493"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2506">  
<figDesc>Page 493.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and the platform of the churches, was precisely as it was understood to be laid down in Matt. xviii. 15-17. Following these  
directions, Samuel Nurse first called alone upon Mr. Parris, and  
privately made known his grievances. Parris gave him no satisfaction. Then, after a due interval, Nurse, Tarbell, and Wilkins  
called upon him together. He refused to see them together, but  
one at a time was allowed to go up into his study. Tarbell and  
Nurse each spent an hour or more with him, leaving no time for  
Wilkins. In these interviews, he not only failed to give satisfaction, but, according to his own account, treated them in the coolest and most unfeeling manner, not allowing himself to utter a  
soothing word, but actually reiterating his belief of the guilt of  
their mother; telling them, as he says, &ldquo;that he had not seen  
sufficient grounds to vary his opinion.&rdquo; Cloyse came soon after  
to the village, and had an interview with him for the same purpose.  
Parris saw them one only at a time, in order to preclude their  
taking the second step required by the gospel rule; that is, to have  
a brother of the church with them as a witness. He also took the  
ground that they could not be witnesses for each other, but that  
he should treat them all as only one person in the transaction. A  
sense of the injustice of his conduct, or some other consideration,  
led William Way, another of the brethren, to go with them as a  
witness. Nurse, Tarbell, Wilkins, Cloyse, and Way went to his  
house together. He said that the four first were but one person  
in the case; but admitted that Way was a distinct person, a brother  
of accredited standing, and a witness. He escaped, however,  
under the subterfuge that the gospel rule required &ldquo;two or <hi rend="italics">three</hi>  
witnesses.&rdquo; In this way, the matter stood for some time; Parris  
saying that they had not complied with the conditions in Matt.  
xviii., and they maintaining that they had.</p>  
<p>The course of Parris was fast diminishing his hold upon the  
public confidence. It was plain that the disaffected brethren had  
done what they could, in an orderly way, to procure a council.  
At length, the leading clergymen here and in Boston, whose minds  
were open to reason, thought it their duty to interpose their advice.  
They wrote to Parris, that he and his church ought to consent to a  
council. They wrote a second time in stronger terms. Not daring  
to quarrel with so large a portion of the clergy, Parris pretended  
to comply with their advice, but demanded a majority of the council  
<pb n="494" id="vII494"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2507">  
<figDesc>Page 494.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
to be chosen by him and his church. The disaffected brethren  
insisted upon a fair, mutual council; each party to have three  
ministers, with their delegates, in it. To this, Parris had finally  
to agree. The dissatisfied brethren named, as one of their three,  
a church at Ipswich. Parris objected to the Ipswich church.  
The dissenting brethren insisted that each side should be free to  
select its respective three churches. Parris was not willing to have  
Ipswich in the council. The other party insisted, and here the  
matter hung suspended. The truth is, that the disaffected brethren were resolved to have the Rev. John Wise in the council.  
They knew Cotton Mather would be there, on the side of Parris;  
and they knew that John Wise was the man to meet him. The  
public opinion settled down in favor of the dissatisfied brethren,  
on the ground that each party to a mutual council ought to &mdash; and,  
to make it really mutual, must &mdash; have free and full power to nominate the churches to be called by it. Parris, being afraid to have  
a mutual council, and particularly if Mr. Wise was in it, suddenly  
took a new position. He and his church called an <foreign lang="unknown" rend="italics">ex parte</foreign> council,  
at which the following ministers, with their delegates, were present: Samuel Checkley of the New South Church, James Allen of  
the First Church, Samuel Willard of the Old South, Increase and  
Cotton Mather of the North Church, &mdash; all of Boston; Samuel  
Torrey of Weymouth; Samuel Phillips of Rowley, and Edward  
Payson, also of Rowley. Among the delegates were many of the  
leading public men of the province. The Result was essentially  
damaging to Mr. Parris. The tide was now strongly set against  
him. The Boston ministers advised him to withdraw from the  
contest. They provided a settlement for him in Connecticut, and  
urged him to quit the village, and go there. But he refused,  
and prolonged the struggle. In the course of it, papers were  
drawn up and signed, one by his friends, another by his opponents, together embracing nearly all the men and women of the  
village. Those who did not sign either paper were understood to  
sympathize with the disaffected brethren. Many who signed the  
paper favorable to him acted undoubtedly from the motive stated  
in the heading; viz., that the removal of Mr. Parris could do no  
good, &ldquo;for we have had three ministers removed already, and by  
every removal our differences have been rather aggravated.&rdquo;  
Another removal, they thought, would utterly ruin them. They  
<pb n="495" id="vII495"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2508">  
<figDesc>Page 495.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
do not express any particular interest in Mr. Parris, but merely  
dread another change. They preferred to bear the ills they had,  
rather than fly to others that they knew not of. It is a very significant fact, that neither Mrs. Ann Putnam nor the widow Sarah  
Houlton signed either paper (the Sarah Houlton whose name  
appears was the wife of Joseph Houlton, Sr.). There is reason  
to believe that they regretted the part they had taken, particularly  
against Rebecca Nurse, and probably did not feel over favorably  
to the person who had led them into their dreadful responsibility.</p>  
<p>In the mean time, the controversy continued to wax warm among  
the people. Mr. Parris was determined to hold his place, and, with  
it, the parsonage and ministry lands. The opposition was active,  
unappeasable, and effective. The following paper, handed about,  
illustrates the methods by which they assailed him: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;As to the contest between Mr. Parris and his hearers, &amp;c., it may  
be composed by a satisfactory answer to Lev. xx. 6: `And the soul  
that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go  
a-whoring after them, I will set my face against that soul, and will cut  
him off from among his people.' 1 Chron. x. 13, 14: `So Saul died  
for his transgression which he committed against the Lord, &mdash; even  
against the word of the Lord, which he kept not, &mdash; and also for asking  
counsel of one who had a familiar to inquire of it, and inquired not of  
the Lord: therefore he slew him,&rdquo;' &amp;c.</p></q>  
<p>Mr. Parris mirrored, or rather daguerrotyped, his inmost  
thoughts upon the page of his church record-book. Whatever  
feeling happened to exercise his spirit, found expression there.  
This gives it a truly rare and singular interest. Among a variety  
of scraps variegating the record, and thrown in with other notices  
of deaths, he has the following: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;1694, Oct. 27. &mdash; Ruth, daughter to Job Swinnerton (died), and  
buried the 28th instant, being the Lord's Day; and the corpse carried by  
the meeting-house door in time of singing before meeting afternoon,  
and more at the funeral than at the sermon.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>This illustrates the state of things. The Swinnerton family  
were all along opposed to Mr. Parris, and kept remarkably clear  
from the witchcraft delusion. Originally, it was not customary to  
have prayers at funerals. At any rate, all that Mr. Parris had  
to do on the occasion was to witness and record the fact, which he  
<pb n="496" id="vII496"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2509">  
<figDesc>Page 496.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
indites in the pithy manner in which he often relieves his mind, that  
more people went to the distant burial-ground than came to hear  
him preach. The procession was made up of his opponents; the  
congregation, of his friends. At last, Captain John Putnam proposed that each party should choose an equal number from themselves to decide the controversy; and that Major Bartholomew  
Gedney, from the town, should be invited to act as moderator of  
the joint meeting. Both sides agreed, and appointed their representatives. Major Gedney consented to preside. But this movement came to nothing, probably owing to the refractoriness of Mr.  
Parris; for, from that moment, he had no supporters. The church  
ceased to act: its members were merged in the meeting of the  
inhabitants. There was no longer any division among them. The  
party that had acted as friends of Mr. Parris united thenceforward  
with his opponents to defend the parish in the suit he had brought  
against it in the courts. The controversy was quite protracted.  
The Court was determined to uphold him, and expressed its prejudice against the parish, sometimes with considerable severity of  
manner and action.<note target="v2n11">*</note></p>

</p>  
<p>The parish heeded not the frowns of the Court, but persisted  
inexorably in its purpose to get rid of Mr. Parris. After an obstinate contest, it prevailed. In the last stage of the controversy,  
it appointed four men, as its agents or attorneys, whose names  
indicate the spirit in which it acted, &mdash; John Tarbell, Samuel Nurse,  
Daniel Andrew, and Joseph Putnam. His dauntless son did not  
follow the wolf through the deep and dark recesses of his den with  
a more determined resolution than that with which Joseph Putnam pursued Samuel Parris through the windings of the law, until  
he ferreted him out, and rid the village of him for ever.</p>  
<p>Finally, the inferior court of Common Pleas, before which Mr.  
Parris had carried the case, ordered that the matters in controversy between him and the inhabitants of Salem Village should be  
referred to arbitrators for decision. The following statement was  
laid before them by the persons representing the inhabitants: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">To the Honorable Wait Winthrop, Elisha Cook, and Samuel Sewall,  
Esquires, Arbitrators, indifferently chosen, between Mr. Samuel Parris  
and the Inhabitants of Salem Village.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Remonstrances of several Aggrieved Persons in the said Village, with  
further Reasons why they conceive they ought not to hear Mr. Parris, nor  
to own him as a Minister of the Gospel, nor to contribute any Support to  
him as such for several years past, humbly offered as fit for consideration.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;We humbly conceive that, having, in April, 1693, given our reasons why we could not join with Mr. Parris in prayer, preaching, or  
sacrament, if these reasons are found sufficient for our withdrawing  
(and we cannot yet find but they are), then we conceive ourselves virtually discharged, not only in conscience, but also in law, which requires  
<pb n="498" id="vII498"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2511">  
<figDesc>Page 498.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
maintenance to be given to such as are orthodox and blameless;  
the said Mr. Parris having been teaching such dangerous errors, and  
preached such scandalous immoralities, as ought to discharge any  
(though ever so gifted otherways) from the work of the ministry, particularly in his oath against the lives of several, wherein he swears that  
the prisoners with their looks knock down those pretended sufferers.  
We humbly conceive that he that swears to more than he is certain of,  
is equally guilty of perjury with him that swears to what is false. And  
though they did fall at such a time, yet it could not be known that they  
did it, much less could they be certain of it; yet did swear positively  
against the lives of such as he could not have any knowledge but they  
might be innocent.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;His believing the Devil's accusations, and readily departing from  
all charity to persons, though of blameless and godly lives, upon such  
suggestions; his promoting such accusations; as also his partiality  
therein in stifling the accusations of some, and, at the same time, vigilantly promoting others, &mdash; as we conceive, are just causes for our refusal, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;That Mr. Parris's going to Mary Walcot or Abigail Williams, and  
directing others to them, to know who afflicted the people in their illnesses, &mdash; we understand this to be a dealing with them that have a  
familiar spirit, and an implicit denying the providence of God, who  
alone, as we believe, can send afflictions, or cause devils to afflict any:  
this we also conceive sufficient to justify such refusal.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;That Mr. Parris, by these practices and principles, has been the  
beginner and procurer of the sorest afflictions, not to this village only,  
but to this whole country, that did ever befall them.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;We, the subscribers, in behalf of ourselves, and of several others of  
the same mind with us (touching these things), having some of us had  
our relations by these practices taken off by an untimely death; others  
have been imprisoned and suffered in our persons, reputations, and  
estates, &mdash; submit the whole to your honors' decision, to determine  
whether we are or ought to be any ways obliged to honor, respect, and  
support such an instrument of our miseries; praying God to guide  
your honors to act herein as may be for his glory, and the future  
settlement of our village in amity and unity.</p>

<p>The arbitrators decided that the inhabitants should pay to Mr.  
Parris a certain amount for arrearages, and also the sum of &pound;79.  
9<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> for all his right and interest in the ministry house and land,  
and that he be forthwith dismissed; and his ministerial relation to  
the church and society in Salem Village dissolved. The parish  
raised the money with great alacrity. Nathaniel Ingersol, who  
had, as has been stated, made him a present at his settlement of  
a valuable piece of land adjoining the parsonage grounds, bought  
it back, paying him a liberal price for it, fully equal to its value;  
and he left the place, so far as appears, for ever.</p>  
<p>On the 14th of July, 1696, in the midst of his controversy with  
his people, his wife died. She was an excellent woman; and was  
respected and lamented by all. He caused a stone slab to be  
placed at the head of her grave, with a suitable inscription, still  
plainly legible, concluding with four lines, to which his initials are  
appended, composed by him, of which this is one: &ldquo;Farewell, best  
wife, choice mother, neighbor, friend.&rdquo; Her ashes rest in what is  
called the Wadsworth burial ground.</p>  
<p>Mr. Parris removed to Newton, then to Concord; and in  
November, 1697, began to preach at Stow, on a salary of forty  
pounds, half in money and half in provisions, &amp;c. A grant from  
the general court was relied upon from year to year to help to  
make up the twenty pounds to be paid in money. Afterwards he  
preached at Dunstable, partly supported by a grant from the  
general court, and finally in Sudbury, where he died, Feb. 27,  
1720. His daughter Elizabeth, who belonged, it will be remembered, to the circle of &ldquo;afflicted children&rdquo; in 1692, then nine  
years of age, in 1710 married Benjamin Barnes of Concord.  
Two other daughters married in Sudbury. His son Noyes, who  
graduated at Harvard College in 1721, became deranged, and was  
supported by the town. His other son Samuel was long deacon  
of the church at Sudbury, and died Nov. 22, 1792, aged ninety years.</p>  
<p>In the &ldquo;Boston News Letter,&rdquo; No. 1433, July 15, 1731, is a  
notice, as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Any person or persons who knew Mr. Samuel Parris, formerly  
of Barbadoes, afterwards of Boston in New England, merchant, and  
after that minister of Salem Village, &amp;c., deceased to be a son of  
Thomas Parris of the island aforesaid, Esq. who deceased 1673, or  
<pb n="500" id="vII500"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2513">  
<figDesc>Page 500.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
sole heir by will to all his estate in said island, are desired to give or  
send notice thereof to the printer of this paper; and it shall be for their  
advantage.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>Whether the identity of Mr. Parris, of Salem Village, with the  
son of Thomas Parris, of Barbadoes, was established, we have no  
information. If it was, some relief may have come to his descendants. There is every reason to believe, that, after leaving the  
village, he and his family suffered from extremely limited means,  
if not from absolute poverty. The general ill-repute brought  
upon him by his conduct in the witchcraft prosecutions followed  
him to the last. He had forfeited the sympathy of his clerical  
brethren by his obstinate refusal to take their advice. They  
earnestly, over and over again, expostulated against his prolonging the controversy with the people of Salem Village, besought  
him to relinquish it, and promised him, if he would, to provide an  
eligible settlement elsewhere. They actually did provide one.  
But he rejected their counsels and persuasions, in expressions of  
ill-concealed bitterness. So that, when he was finally driven away,  
they felt under no obligations to befriend him; and with his eminent abilities he <unclear></unclear> out a precarious and inadequate maintenance  
for himself and family, in feeble settlements in outskirt towns,  
during the rest of his days.</p>  
<p>It is difficult to describe the character of this unfortunate man.  
Just as is the condemnation which facts compel history to pronounce, I have a feeling of relief in the thought, that, before the  
tribunal to which he so long ago passed, the mercy we all shall  
need, which comprehends all motives and allows for all infirmities, has been extended to him, in its infinite wisdom and benignity.</p>  
<p>He was a man of uncommon abilities, of extraordinary vivacity  
and activity of intellect. He does not appear to have been wilfully  
malevolent; although somewhat reckless in a contest, he was not  
deliberately untruthful; on the contrary, there is in his statements  
a singular ingenuousness and fairness, seldom to be found in a  
partisan, much more seldom in a principal. Although we get  
almost all we know of the examinations of accused parties in the  
witchcraft proceedings, and of his long contentions with his parish,  
from him, there is hardly any ground to regret that the parties on  
the other side had no friends to tell their story. A transparency  
<pb n="501" id="vII501"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2514">  
<figDesc>Page 501.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of character, a sort of instinctive incontinency of mind, which  
made him let out every thing, or a sort of blindness which prevented his seeing the bearings of what was said and done, make  
his reports the vehicles of the materials for the defence of the very  
persons he was prosecuting. I know of no instance like it. His  
style is lucid, graphic, lively, natural to the highest degree; and  
whatever he describes, we see the whole, and, as it were, from all  
points of view. Language flowed from his pen with a facility,  
simplicity, expressiveness, and accuracy, not surpassed or often  
equalled. He wrote as men talk, using colloquial expressions  
without reserve, but always to the point. When we read, we  
hear him; abbreviating names, and clipping words, as in the  
most familiar and unguarded conversation. He was not hampered  
by fear of offending the rules which some think necessary to dignify composition. In his off-hand, free and easy, gossiping entries  
in the church-book, or in his carefully prepared productions, like  
the &ldquo;Meditations for Peace,&rdquo; read before his church and the dissatisfied brethren, we have specimens of plain good English, in its  
most translucent and effective forms. Considering that his academic education was early broken off, and many intermediate  
years were spent in commercial pursuits, his learning and attainments are quite remarkable. The various troubles and tragic  
mischiefs of his life, the terrible wrongs he inflicted on others, and  
the retributions he brought upon himself, are traccable to two or  
three peculiarities in his mental and moral organization.</p>  
<p>He had a passion for a scene, a ceremony, an excitement. He  
delighted in the exercise of power, and rejoiced in conflicts or  
commotions, from the exhilaration they occasioned, and the opportunity they gave for the gratification of the activity of his nature.  
He pursued the object of getting possession of the ministry house  
and land with such desperate pertinacity, not, I think, from avaricious motives, but for the sake of the power it would give him  
as a considerable landholder. His love of form and public excitement led him to operate as he did with his church. He kept it in  
continual action during the few years of his ministry. He had at  
least seventy-five special meetings of that body, without counting  
those which probably occurred without number, but of which  
there is no record, during the six months of the witchcraft period.  
Twice, the brethren gave out, wholly exhausted; and the powers  
<pb n="502" id="vII502"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2515">  
<figDesc>Page 502.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
of the church were, by vote, transferred to a special committee, to  
act in its behalf, composed of persons who had time and strength  
to spare. But Mr. Parris, never weary of excitement, would have  
been delighted to preside over church-meetings, and to be a participator in vehement proceedings, every day of his life. The  
more noisy and heated the contention, the more he enjoyed it.  
During all the transactions connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, he was everywhere present, always wide awake, full of  
animation, if not cheerfulness, and ready to take any part to carry  
them on. These propensities and dispositions were fraught with  
danger, and prolific of evil in his case, in consequence of what  
looks very much like a total want in himself of many of the natural  
human sensibilities, and an inability to apprehend them in others.  
Through all the horrors of the witchcraft prosecutions, he never  
evinced the slightest sensibility, and never seemed to be aware  
that anybody else had any. It was not absolute cruelty, but the  
absence of what may be regarded as a natural sense. It was not  
a positive wickedness, but a negative defect. He seemed to be  
surprised that other people had sentiments, and could not understand why Tarbell and Nurse felt so badly about the execution of  
their mother. He told them to their faces, without dreaming of  
giving them offence, that, while they thought she was innocent, and  
he thought she was guilty and had been justly put to death, it was a  
mere difference of opinion, as about an indifferent matter. In his  
&ldquo;Meditations for Peace,&rdquo; presented to these dissatisfied brethren,  
for the purpose and with an earnest desire of appeasing them, he  
tells them that the indulgence of such feelings at all is a yielding  
to &ldquo;temptation,&rdquo; being under &ldquo;the clouds of human weakness,&rdquo;  
and &ldquo;a bewraying of remaining corruption.&rdquo; Indeed, the theology  
of that day, it must be allowed, bore very hard upon even the best  
and most sacred affections of our nature. The council, in their  
Result, allude to the feelings of those whose parents, and other  
most loved and honored relatives and connections, had been so  
cruelly torn from them and put to death, as &ldquo;infirmities discovered by them in such an heart-breaking day,&rdquo; and bespeak for  
their grief and lamentations a charitable construction. They ask  
the church, whose hands were red with the blood of their innocent  
and dearest friends, not to pursue them with &ldquo;more critical and  
vigorous proceedings&rdquo; in consequence of their exhibiting these  
<pb n="503" id="vII503"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2516">  
<figDesc>Page 503.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
natural sensibilities on the occasion, but &ldquo;to treat them with  
bowels of much compassion.&rdquo; These views had taken full effect  
upon Mr. Parris, and obliterated from his breast all such &ldquo;infirmities.&rdquo; This is the only explanation or apology that can be made  
for him.</p>  
<p>Of the history of Cotton Mather, subsequently to the witchcraft  
prosecutions, and more or less in consequence of his agency in  
them, it may be said that the residue of his life was doomed to disappointment, and imbittered by reproach and defeat. The storm  
of fanatical delusion, which he doubted not would carry him to the  
heights of clerical and spiritual power, in America and everywhere,  
had left him a wreck. His political aspirations, always one of his  
strongest passions, were wholly blasted; and the great aim and  
crown of his ambition, the Presidency of Harvard College, once  
and again and for ever had eluded his grasp. I leave him to tell  
his story, and reveal the state of his mind and heart in his own  
most free and full expressions from his private diary for the year  
1724.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;1. What has a gracious Lord helped me to do for the <hi rend="italics">seafaring

<p>&ldquo;2. What has a gracious Lord helped me to do for the instruction  
and salvation and comfort of the poor negroes? And yet some, on

ever gone into any company, or had any coming to me, without some

acquainted with.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;10. What has a gracious Lord given me to do in <hi rend="italics">good offices,</hi>

some devices, even written devices, to be serviceable. And yet my

my services. Everybody points at me, and speaks of me as by far  
the most afflicted minister in all New England. And many look on  
me as the greatest sinner, because the greatest sufferer; and are pretty  
arbitrary in their conjectures upon my punished miscarriages.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Diary, May</hi> 7, 1724. &mdash; The sudden death of the unhappy man  
who sustained the place of President in our College will open a door  
for my doing singular services in the best of interests. I do not know  
that the care of the College will now be cast upon me, though I am  
told that it is what is most generally wished for. If it should be, I  
shall be in abundance of distress about it; but, if it should not, yet  
I may do many things for the good of the College more quietly and  
more hopefully than formerly.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">June</hi> 5. &mdash; The College is in great hazard of dissipation and grievous destruction and confusion. My advice to some that have some  
influence on the public may be seasonable.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">July</hi> 1, 1724. &mdash; This day being our <hi rend="italics">insipid, ill-contrived anniversary,</hi>  
which we call the <hi rend="italics">Commencement,</hi> I chose to spend it at home in supplications, partly on the behalf of the College that it may not be foolishly  
thrown away, but that God may bestow such a President upon it as  
may prove a rich blessing unto it and unto all our churches.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>On the 18th of November, 1724, the corporation of Harvard  
College elected the Rev. Benjamin Colman, pastor of the Brattle Church in Boston, to the vacant presidential chair. He  
declined the appointment. The question hung in suspense another six months. In June, 1725, the Rev. Benjamin Wadsworth,  
pastor of the First Church in Boston, was elected, accepted the  
office, and held it to his death, on the 16th of March, 1737. It  
may easily be imagined how keenly these repeated slights were  
felt by Cotton Mather. He died on the 13th of February,  
1728.</p>  
<p>From the early part of the spring of 1695, when the abortive  
attempt to settle the difficulty between Mr. Parris and the people  
of the village, by the umpirage of Major Gedney, was made, it  
evidently became the settled purpose of the leading men, on both  
sides, to restore harmony to the place. On all committees, persons  
who had been prominent in opposition to each other were joined  
together, that, thus co-operating, they might become reconciled.  
<pb n="506" id="vII506"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2519">  
<figDesc>Page 506.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
This is strikingly illustrated in the &ldquo;seating of the meeting-house,&rdquo;  
as it was called. In 1699, in a seat accommodating three persons,  
John Putnam the son of Nathaniel, and John Tarbell, were two of  
the three. Another seat for three was occupied by James and John  
Putnam, sons of John, and by Thomas Wilkins. Thomas Putnam  
and Samuel Nurse were placed in the same seat; and so were the  
wives of Thomas Putnam and Samuel Nurse, and the widow  
Sarah Houlton. The widow Preston, daughter of Rebecca Nurse,  
was seated with the widow Walcot, mother of Mary, one of the  
accusing girls.</p>  
<p>We see in this the effect of the wise and decisive course adopted  
by Mr. Parris's successor, the Rev. Joseph Green. Immediately  
upon his ordination, Nov. 10, 1698, he addressed himself in earnest to the work of reconciliation in that distracted parish. From  
the date of its existence, nearly thirty years before, it had been  
torn by constant strife. It had just passed through scenes which  
had brought all hearts into the most terrible alienation. A man  
of less faith would not have believed it possible, that the horrors  
and outrages of those scenes could ever be forgotten, forgiven, or  
atoned for, by those who had suffered or committed the wrongs.  
But he knew the infinite power of the divine love, which, as a minister of Christ, it was his office to inspire and diffuse. He knew  
that, with the blessing of God, that people, who had from the first  
been devouring each other, and upon whose garments the stain of  
the blood of brethren and sisters was fresh, might be made &ldquo;kind  
one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as  
God for Christ's sake hath forgiven&rdquo; them. In this heroic and  
Christ-like faith, he entered upon and steadfastly adhered to his  
divine work. He pursued it with patience, wisdom, and courageous  
energy. No ministry in the whole history of the New-England  
churches has had a more difficult task put upon it, and none has  
more perfectly succeeded in its labors. I shall describe the administration of this good man, as a minister of reconciliation, in his  
own words, transcribed from his church records: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Nov. 25, 1698, being spent in holy exercises (in order to our preparation for the sacrament of the Lord's Supper), at John Putnam,  
Jr.'s, after the exercise, I desired the church to manifest, by the usual  
sign, that they were so cordially satisfied with their brethren, Thomas  
Wilkins, John Tarbell, and Samuel Nurse, that they were heartily

desirous that they would join with us in all ordinances, that so we  
might all live lovingly together. This they consented unto, and none  
made any objection, but voted it by lifting up their hands. And further, that whatever articles they had drawn up against these brethren  
formerly, they now looked upon them as nothing, but let them fall to  
the ground, being willing that they should be buried for ever.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Feb. 5, 1699. &mdash; This day, also our brother John Tarbell, and his  
wife, and Thomas Wilkins and his wife, and Samuel Nurse's wife,  
joined with us in the Lord's Supper; which is a matter of thankfulness, seeing they have for a long time been so offended as that they  
could not comfortably join with us.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;1702. &mdash; In December, the pastor spake to the church, on the sabbath, as followeth: `Brethren, I find in your church-book a record of  
Martha Corey's being excommunicated for witchcraft; and, the generality of the land being sensible of the errors that prevailed in that  
day, some of her friends have moved me several times to propose to  
the church whether it be not our duty to recall that sentence, that so  
it may not stand against her to all generations; and I myself being a  
stranger to her, and being ignorant of what was alleged against her, I  
shall now only leave it to your consideration, and shall determine the  
matter by a vote the next convenient opportunity.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Feb. 14, 170&frac23;. &mdash; The major part of the brethren consented to the  
following: `Whereas this church passed a vote, Sept. 11, 1692, for  
the excommunication of Martha Corey, and that sentence was pronounced against her Sept. 14, by Mr. Samuel Parris, formerly the  
pastor of this church; she being, before her excommunication, condemned, and afterwards executed, for supposed witchcraft; and there  
being a record of this in our church-book, page 12, we being moved  
hereunto, do freely consent and heartily desire that the same sentence  
may be revoked, and that it may stand no longer against her; for we  
are, through God's mercy to us, convinced that we were at that dark  
day under the power of those errors which then prevailed in the land;  
and we are sensible that we had not sufficient grounds to think her  
guilty of that crime for which she was condemned and executed; and  
that her excommunication was not according to the mind of God,  
and therefore we desire that this may be entered in our church-book,  
to take off that odium that is cast on her name, and that so God may  
forgive our sin, and may be atoned for the land; and we humbly pray  
that God will not leave us any more to such errors and sins, but will  
teach and enable us always to do that which is right in his sight.'</p>

<p>The First Church in Salem rescinded its votes of excommunication of Rebecca Nurse and Giles Corey, in March, 1712. The  
church at the village was nearly ten years before it, in this act of  
justice to itself and to the memory of the injured dead. Mr.  
Green did not wait until the public sentiment drove him to it.  
He regarded it as his duty to lead, and keep in front of that sentiment, in the right direction. He did not wait until everybody  
demanded it to be done, but instantly began to prepare his people  
for it. At the proper time, he gave notice that he was about to  
bring the question before them; and he accordingly did so. He  
had no idea of allowing a few narrow-minded, obstinate individuals  
to keep the blot any longer upon the records of his church. His  
conduct is honorable to his name, and to the name of the village.  
By wise, prudent, but persistent efforts, he gradually repaired  
every breach, brought his parish out from under reproach, and set  
them right with each other, with the obligations of justice, and  
with the spirit of Christianity. It is affecting to read his ejaculations of praise and gratitude to God for every symptom of the  
prevalence of harmony and love among the people of his charge.</p>  
<p>The man who extinguished the fires of passion in a community  
that had ever before been consumed by them deserves to be held  
in lasting honor. The history of the witchcraft delusion in Salem  
Village would, indeed, be imperfectly written, if it failed to present  
the character of him who healed its wounds, obliterated the traces  
of its malign influence on the hearts and lives of those who acted,  
and repaired the wrongs done to the memory of those who suffered,  
in it. Joseph Green had a manly and amiable nature. He was  
a studious scholar and an able preacher. He was devoted to  
his ministry and faithful to its obligations. He was a leader of his  
people, and shared in their occupations and experiences. He was  
active in the ordinary employments of life and daily concerns of  
society. Possessed of independent property, he was frugal and  
simple in his habits, and liberal in the use of his means. The parsonage, while he lived in it, was the abode of hospitality, and  
frequented by the best society in the neighborhood. By mingled  
firmness and kindliness, he met and removed difficulties. He had  
a cheerful temperament, was not irritated by the course of events,  
even when of an unpleasant character. While Mr. Noyes was  
disturbed, even to resentment, by encroachments upon his parish,  
<pb n="509" id="vII509"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2522">  
<figDesc>Page 509.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
in the formation of new societies in the middle precinct of Salem,  
now South Danvers, and in the second precinct of Beverly, now  
Upper Beverly, Mr. Green, although they drew away from him  
as many as from Mr. Noyes, went to participate in the raising of  
their meeting-houses. Of a genial disposition, he countenanced  
innocent amusements. He was fond of the sports of the field.  
The catamount was among the trophies of his sure aim, and he  
came home with his huntsman's bag filled with wild pigeons. He  
would take his little sons before and behind him on his horse, and  
spend a day with them fishing and fowling on Wilkins's Pond;  
and, when Indians threatened the settlements, he would shoulder  
his musket, join the brave young men of his parish, and be the  
first in the encounter, and the last to relinquish the pursuit of  
the savage foe.</p>  
<p>He was always, everywhere, a peacemaker; by his genial manner, and his genuine dignity and decision of character, he removed dissensions from his church and neighborhood, and secured  
the respect while he won the love of all. That such a person was  
raised up and placed where he was at that time, was truly a  
providence of God.</p>  
<p>The part performed in the witchcraft tragedy by the extraordinary child of twelve years of age, Ann Putnam, has been fully set  
forth. As has been stated, both her parents (and no one can measure their share of responsibility, nor that of others behind them, for  
her conduct) died within a fortnight of each other, in 1699. She was  
then nineteen years of age; a large family of children, all younger  
than herself, was left with her in the most melancholy orphanage.  
How many there were, we do not exactly know: eight survived  
her. Although their uncles, Edward and Joseph, were near, and  
kind, and able to care for them, the burden thrown upon her must  
have been great. With the terrible remembrance of the scenes  
of 1692, it was greater than she could bear. Her health began to  
decline, and she was long an invalid. Under the tender and faithful guidance of Mr. Green, she did all that she could to seek the  
forgiveness of God and man. After consultations with him, in  
visits to his study, a confession was drawn up, which she desired  
publicly to make. Upon conferring with Samuel Nurse, it was  
found to be satisfactory to him, as the representative of those who  
had suffered from her testimony. It was her desire to offer this  
<pb n="510" id="vII510"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2523">  
<figDesc>Page 510.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
confession and a profession of religion at the same time. The day  
was fixed, and made known to the public. On the 25th of August,  
1706, a great concourse assembled in the meeting-house. Large  
numbers came from other places, particularly from the town of  
Salem. The following document, having been judged sufficient  
and suitable, was written out in the church-book the evening  
before, and signed by her. It was read by the pastor before the  
congregation, who were seated; she standing in her place while it  
was read, and owning it as hers by a declaration to that effect at  
its close, and also acknowledging the signature.</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">The Confession of Anne Putnam, when she was received to Communion,</hi> 1706.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;I desire to be humbled before God for that sad and humbling  
providence that befell my father's family in the year about '92; that I,  
then being in my childhood, should, by such a providence of God, be  
made an instrument for the accusing of several persons of a grievous  
crime, whereby their lives were taken away from them, whom now I  
have just grounds and good reason to believe they were innocent persons; and that it was a great delusion of Satan that deceived me in  
that sad time, whereby I justly fear I have been instrumental, with  
others, though ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon myself and  
this land the guilt of innocent blood; though what was said or done  
by me against any person I can truly and uprightly say, before God  
and man, I did it not out of any anger, malice, or ill-will to any person, for I had no such thing against one of them; but what I did was  
ignorantly, being deluded by Satan. And particularly, as I was a  
chief instrument of accusing of Goodwife Nurse and her two sisters,  
I desire to lie in the dust, and to be humbled for it, in that I was a  
cause, with others, of so sad a calamity to them and their families; for  
which cause I desire to lie in the dust, and earnestly beg forgiveness  
of God, and from all those unto whom I have given just cause of sorrow and offence, whose relations were taken away or accused.</p>

<p>This paper shows the baleful influence of the doctrine of Satan

then received. It afforded a refuge and escape from the compunctions of conscience. The load of sin was easily thrown upon  
the back of Satan. This young woman was undoubtedly sincere  
in her penitence, and was forgiven, we trust and believe; but she  
failed to see the depth of her iniquity, and of those who instigated  
and aided her, in her false accusations. The blame, and the deed,  
were wholly hers and theirs. Satan had no share in it. Human  
responsibility cannot thus be avoided.</p>  
<p>While, in a certain sense, she imputes the blame to Satan, this  
declaration of Ann Putnam is conclusive evidence that she and her  
confederate accusers did not believe in any communications having  
been made to them by invisible spirits of any kind. Those persons, in our day, who imagine that they hold intercourse, by rapping or otherwise, with spiritual beings, have sometimes found  
arguments in favor of their belief in the phenomena of the witchcraft trials. But Ann Putnam's confession is decisive against this.  
If she had really received from invisible beings, subordinate spirits,  
or the spirits of deceased persons, the matters to which she testified, or ever believed that she had, she would have said so. On  
the contrary, she declares that she had no foundation whatever,  
from any source, for what she said, but was under the subtle and  
mysterious influence of the Devil himself.</p>  
<p>She died at about the age of thirty-six years. Her will is dated  
May 20, 1715, and was presented in probate June 29, 1716. Its  
preamble is as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;In the name of God, amen. I, Anne Putnam, of the town of  
Salem, single woman, being oftentimes sick and weak in body, but  
of a disposing mind and memory, blessed be God! and calling to mind  
the mortality of my body, and that it is appointed for all men once to  
die, do make this my last will and testament. First of all, I recommend my spirit into the hands of God, through Jesus Christ my  
Redeemer, with whom I hope to live for ever; and, as for my body, I  
commit it to the earth, to be buried in a Christian and decent manner,  
at the discretion of my executor, hereafter named, nothing doubting  
but, by the mighty power of God, to receive the same again at the  
resurrection.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>She divided her land to her four brothers, and her personal  
estate to her four sisters.</p>  
<p>It seems that she was frequently the subject of sickness, and  
<pb n="512" id="vII512"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2525">  
<figDesc>Page 512.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
her bodily powers much weakened. The probability is, that the  
long-continued strain kept upon her muscular and nervous organization, during the witchcraft scenes, had destroyed her constitution.  
Such uninterrupted and vehement exercise, to their utmost tension,  
of the imaginative, intellectual, and physical powers, in crowded  
and heated rooms, before the public gaze, and under the feverish  
and consuming influence of bewildering and all but delirious excitement, could hardly fail to sap the foundations of health in so  
young a child. The tradition is, that she had a slow and fluctuating  
decline. The language of her will intimates, that, at intervals,  
there were apparent checks to her discase, and rallies of strength,  
&mdash; &ldquo;oftentimes sick and weak in body.&rdquo; She inherited from her  
mother a sensitive and fragile constitution; but her father, although  
brought to the grave, probably by the terrible responsibilities and  
trials in which he had been involved, at a comparatively early age,  
belonged to a long-lived race and neighborhood. The opposite  
elements of her composition struggled in a protracted contest, &mdash; on  
the one side, a nature morbidly subject to nervous excitability  
sinking under the exhaustion of an overworked, overburdened,  
and shattered system; on the other, tenacity of life. The conflict  
continued with alternating success for years; but the latter gave  
way at last. Her story, in all its aspects, is worthy of the study  
of the psychologist. Her confession, profession, and death point  
the moral.</p>  
<p>The Rev. Joseph Green died Nov. 26, 1715. The following  
tribute to his memory is inscribed on the records of the church.  
It is in the handwriting, and style of thought and language, of  
Deacon Edward Putnam.</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Then was the choicest flower and greenest olive-tree in the garden  
of our God here cut down in its prime and flourishing estate at the age  
of forty years and two days, who had been a faithful ambassador from  
God to us eighteen years. Then did that bright star set, and never  
more to appear here among us; then did our sun go down; and now  
what darkness is come upon us! Put away and pardon our iniquities,  
O Lord! which have been the cause of thy sore displeasure, and  
return to us again in mercy, and provide yet again for this thy flock a  
pastor after thy own heart, as thou hath promised to thy people in thy  
word; on which promise we have hope, for we are called by thy name;  
and, oh, leave us not!&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>The Rev. Peter Clark was ordained June 5, 1717. The termination of the connection between the Salem Village church  
and the witchcraft delusion, and all similar kinds of absurdity and  
wickedness, is marked by the following record, which fully and for  
ever redeems its character. If Samuel Parris had been as wise  
and brave as Peter Clark, he would, in the same decisive manner,  
have nipped the thing in the bud.</p>  
<q><p rend="center">&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Salem Village Church Records.</hi></p>  
<p>&ldquo;Sept. 5, 1746. &mdash; At a church meeting appointed on the lecture,  
the day before, on the occasion of several persons in this parish being  
reported to have resorted to a woman of a very ill reputation, pretending to the art of divination and fortune-telling, &amp;c., to make inquiry into  
that matter, and to take such resolutions as may be thought proper on  
the occasion, the brethren of the church then present came into the  
following votes; viz., That for Christians, especially church-members,  
to seek to and consult reputed witches or fortune-tellers, this church is  
clearly of opinion, and firmly believes on the testimony of the Word  
of God, is highly impious and scandalous, being a violation of the  
Christian covenant sealed in baptism, rendering the persons guilty of  
it subject to the just censure of the church.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;No proof appearing against any of the members of this church  
(some of whom had been strongly suspected of this crime), so as to  
convict them of their being guilty, it was further voted, That the  
pastor, in the name of the church, should publicly testify their disapprobation and abhorrence of this infamous and ungodly practice of  
consulting witches or fortune-tellers, or any that are reputed such;  
exhorting all under their watch, who may have been guilty of it, to  
an hearty repentance and returning to God, earnestly seeking forgiveness in the blood of Christ, and warning all against the like practice  
for the time to come.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;Sept. 7. &mdash; This testimony, exhortation, and warning, voted by the  
church, was publicly given by the pastor, before the dismission of  
the congregation.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>The Salem Village Parish, when its present pastor, the Rev.  
Charles B. Rice, was settled, Sept. 2, 1863, had been in existence  
a hundred and ninety-one years. During its first twenty-five  
years, it had four ministers, whose aggregate period of service  
was eighteen years. During the succeeding hundred and sixty years, it had four ministers, whose aggregate period of service  
<pb n="514" id="vII514"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2527">  
<figDesc>Page 514.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
was one hundred and fifty-eight years. They had all been well  
educated, several were men of uncommon endowments, and without exception they possessed qualities suitable for success and  
usefulness in their calling.</p>  
<p>The first period was filled with an uninterrupted series of  
troubles, quarrels, and animosities, culminating in the most terrific  
and horrible disaster that ever fell upon a people. The second  
period was an uninterrupted reign of peace, harmony, and unity;  
no religious society ever enjoying more comfort in its privileges,  
or exhibiting a better example of all that ought to characterize a  
Christian congregation.</p>  
<p>The contrast between the lives of its ministers, in the two  
periods respectively, is as great as between their pastorates.  
The first four suffered from inadequate means of support, and,  
owing to the feuds in the congregation, rates not being collected,  
were hardly supplied with the necessaries of life. There is no  
symptom in the records of the second period of there having ever  
been any difficulty on this score. The prompt fulfilment of their  
contracts by the people, and the favor of Providence, placed the  
ministers above the reach or approach of inconvenience or annoyance from that quarter.</p>  
<p>The history of the New-England churches presents no epoch  
more melancholy, distressful, and stormy than the first, and none  
more united, prosperous, or commendable than the second period  
in the annals of the Salem Village church.</p>  
<p>The contrast between the fortunes and fates of the ministers  
of these two periods is worthy of being stated in detail.</p>  
<p>James Bayley began to preach at the Village at the formation  
of the society, when he was quite a young man, within three years  
from receiving his degree at Harvard College. After about seven  
years, during which he buried his wife and three children, and  
encountered a bitter and turbulent opposition, &mdash; so far as we can  
see, most causeless and unreasonable, &mdash; he relinquished the ministry altogether, and spent the residue of his life in another profession  
elsewhere.</p>  
<p>The ministry of George Burroughs, at the Village, lasted about  
two years. The violence of both parties to the controversy by  
which the parish had been rent was concentrated upon his innocent and unsheltered head. He was, at a public assembly of his  
<pb n="515" id="vII515"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2528">  
<figDesc>Page 515.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
people, in his own meeting-house, arrested, and taken out in the  
custody of the marshal of the county, a prisoner for a debt incurred to meet the expenses of his wife's recent funeral, of an  
amount less than the salary then due him, and which, in point of  
fact, he had paid at the time by an order upon the parish treasurer.  
From such outrageous ill-treatment, he escaped by resigning his  
ministry. He was followed to his retreat in a remote settlement,  
and while engaged there, a laborious, self-sacrificing, and devoted  
minister, was<unclear></unclear> by the malignity of his enemies at the Village, suddenly seized, all unconscious of having wronged a human creature,  
snatched from the table where he was taking his frugal meal in  
his humble home, torn from his helpless family, hurried up to the  
Village; overwhelmed in a storm of falsehood, rage, and folly;  
loaded with irons, immured in a dungeon, carried to the place of  
execution, consigned to the death of a felon; and his uncoffined  
remains thrown among the clefts of the rocks of Witch Hill, and  
left but half buried, &mdash; for a crime of which he was as innocent as  
the unborn child.</p>  
<p>Deodat Lawson, a great scholar and great preacher, after a  
two years' trial, and having buried his wife and daughter at the  
Village, abandoned the attempt to quell the storm of passion there.  
He found another settlement on the other side of Massachusetts  
Bay, which he left without taking leave, and was never heard of  
more by his people. Eight years afterwards, he re-appeared in the  
reprint, at London, of his famous Salem Village sermon, and then  
vanished for ever from sight. A cloud of impenetrable darkness  
envelopes his name at that point. Of his fate nothing is known,  
except that it was an &ldquo;unhappy&rdquo; one.</p>  
<p>Samuel Parris, after a ministry of seven years, crowded from  
the very beginning with contention and animosity, and closed in  
desolation, ruin, and woes unutterable, havoc scattered among his  
people and the whole country round, was driven from the parish,  
the blood of the innocent charged upon his head, and, for the rest  
of his days, consigned to obscurity and penury. The place of his  
abode has upon it no habitation or structure of man; and the only  
vestiges left of him are his records of the long quarrel with his  
congregation, and his inscription on the headstone, erected by  
him, as he left the Village for ever, over the fresh grave of his  
wife.</p>

<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2529">  
<figDesc>Page 516.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>Surely, the annals of no church present a more dismal, shocking,  
or shameful history than this.</p>  
<p>Joseph Green, on the 26th of November, 1715, terminated  
with his life a ministry of eighteen years, as useful, beneficent,  
and honorable as it had been throughout harmonious and happy.  
Peter Clark died in office, June 10, 1768, after a service of  
fifty-one years. He was recognized throughout the country as an  
able minister and a learned divine. Peace and prosperity reigned,  
without a moment's intermission, among the people of his charge.  
Benjamin Wadsworth, D.D., also died in office, Jan. 18, 1826,  
after a service of fifty-four years. Through life he was universally  
esteemed and loved in all the churches. Milton P. Braman, D.D.,  
on the 1st of April, 1861, terminated by resignation a ministry of  
thirty-five years. He always enjoyed universal respect and affection, and the parish under his care, uninterrupted union and prosperity. He did not leave his people, but remains among them,  
participating in the enjoyment of their privileges, and upholding  
the hands of his successor. His eminent talents are occasionally  
exercised in neighboring pulpits, and in other services of public  
usefulness. He lives in honored retirement on land originally  
belonging to Nathaniel Putnam, distant only a few rods, a little to  
the north of east, from the spot owned and occupied by his first  
predecessor, James Bayley.</p>  
<p>It can be said with assurance, of this epoch in the history of  
the Salem Village church and society, that it can hardly be paralleled in all that indicates the well-being of man or the blessings of Heaven. No such contrast, as these two periods in the  
annals of this parish present, can elsewhere be found.</p>  
<p>Prosecutions for witchcraft continued in the older countries  
after they had been abandoned here; although it soon began to  
be difficult, everywhere, to procure the conviction of a person  
accused of witchcraft. In 1716, a Mrs. Hicks and her daughter,  
the latter aged nine years, were hanged in Huntingdon, in England, for witchcraft. In the year 1720, an attempt, already  
alluded to, was made to renew the Salem excitement in Littleton,  
Mass., but it failed: the people had learned wisdom at a price too  
dear to allow them so soon to forget it. In a letter to Cotton  
Mather, written Feb. 19, 1720, the excellent Dr. Watts, after  
having expressed his doubts respecting the sufficiency of the spectral  
<pb n="517" id="vII517"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2530">  
<figDesc>Page 517.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
evidence for condemnation, says, in reference to the Salem  
witchcraft, &ldquo;I am much persuaded that there was much immediate agency of the Devil in these affairs, and perhaps there were  
some real witches too.&rdquo; Not far from this time, we find what was  
probably the opinion of the most liberal-minded and cultivated  
people in England expressed in the following language of Addison: &ldquo;To speak my thoughts freely, I believe, in general, that  
there is and has been such a thing as witchcraft, but, at the same  
time, can give no credit to any particular instance of it.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>There was an execution for witchcraft in Scotland in 1722. As  
late as the middle of the last century, an annual discourse, commemorative of executions that took place in Huntingdon during  
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, continued to be delivered in that  
place. An act of a Presbyterian synod in Scotland, published in  
1743, and reprinted at Glasgow in 1766, denounced as a national  
sin the repeal of the penal laws against witchcraft.</p>  
<p>Blackstone, the great oracle of British law, and who flourished  
in the latter half of the last century, declared his belief in witchcraft in the following strong terms: &ldquo;To deny the possibility,  
nay, the actual existence, of witchcraft and sorcery, is at once  
flatly to contradict the revealed Word of God, in various passages  
both of the Old and New Testament; and the thing itself is a  
truth to which every nation in the world hath in its turn borne  
testimony, either by examples seemingly well attested, or by prohibitory laws, which at least suppose the possibility of commerce  
with evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>It is related, in White's &ldquo;Natural History of Selborne,&rdquo; that,  
in the year 1751, the people of Tring, a market town of Hertfordshire, and scarcely more than thirty miles from London, &ldquo;seized  
on two superannuated wretches, crazed with age and overwhelmed  
with infirmities, on a suspicion of witchcraft.&rdquo; They were carried  
to the edge of a horse-pond, and there subjected to the water  
ordeal. The trial resulted in the acquittal of the prisoners; but  
they were both drowned in the process.</p>  
<p>A systematic effort seems to have been made during the eighteenth century to strengthen and renew the power of superstition.  
Alarmed by the progress of infidelity, many eminent and excellent  
men availed themselves of the facilities which their position at  
the head of the prevailing literature afforded them, to push the

</figure>  
faith of the people as far as possible towards the opposite extreme  
of credulity. It was a most unwise, and, in its effects, deplorable  
policy. It was a betrayal of the cause of true religion. It was  
an acknowledgment that it could not be vindicated before the  
tribunal of severe reason. Besides all the misery produced by  
filling the imagination with unreal objects of terror, the restoration  
to influence, during the last century, of the fables and delusions of  
an ignorant age, has done incalculable injury, by preventing the  
progress of Christian truth and sound philosophy; thus promoting  
the cause of the very infidelity it was intended to check. The  
idea of putting down one error by setting up another cannot have  
suggested itself to any mind that had ever been led to appreciate  
the value or the force of truth. But this was the policy of Christian writers from the time of Addison to that of Johnson. The  
latter expressly confesses, that it was necessary to maintain the  
credit of the belief of the existence and agency of ghosts, and  
other supernatural beings, in order to help on the argument for a  
future state as founded upon the Bible.</p>  
<p>Dr. Hibbert, in his excellent book on the &ldquo;Philosophy of  
Apparitions,&rdquo; illustrates some remarks similar to those just made,  
by the following quotation from Mr. Wesley: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;It is true, that the English in general, and indeed most of the  
men in Europe, have given up all accounts of witches and apparitions  
as mere old wives' fables. I am sorry for it; and I willingly take this  
opportunity of entering my solemn protest against this violent compliment, which so many that believe the Bible pay to those who do not  
believe it. I owe them no such service. I take knowledge, these are  
at the bottom of the outcry which has been raised, and with such  
insolence spread throughout the nation, in direct opposition, not only  
to the Bible, but to the suffrage of the wisest and best men in all ages  
and nations. They well know (whether Christians know it or not),  
that the giving up witchcraft is, in effect, giving up the Bible. And  
they know, on the other hand, that, if but one account of the intercourse of men with separate spirits be admitted, their whole castle in  
the air (Deism, Atheism, Materialism) falls to the ground. I know no  
reason, therefore, why we should suffer even this weapon to be wrested  
out of our hands. Indeed, there are numerous arguments besides,  
which abundantly confute their vain imaginations. But we need not  
be hooted out of one: neither reason nor religion requires this.&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>The belief in witchcraft continued to hold a conspicuous place  
among popular superstitions during the whole of the last century.  
Many now living can remember the time when it prevailed very  
generally. Each town or village had its peculiar traditionary  
tales, which were gravely related by the old, and deeply impressed  
upon the young.</p>  
<p>The legend of the &ldquo;Screeching Woman&rdquo; of Marblehead is  
worthy of being generally known. The story runs thus: A piratical cruiser, having captured a Spanish vessel during the seventeenth  
century, brought her into Marblehead harbor, which was then the  
site of a few humble dwellings. The male inhabitants were all  
absent on their fishing voyages. The pirates brought their prisoners ashore, carried them at the dead of the night into a retired  
glen, and there murdered them. Among the captives was an English female passenger. The women who belonged to the place  
heard her dying outcries, as they rose through the midnight air,  
and erverberated far and wide along the silent shores. She was  
heard to exclaim, &ldquo;O mercy, mercy! Lord Jesus Christ, save me!  
Lord Jesus Christ, save me!&rdquo; Her body was buried by the pirates  
on the spot. The same piercing voice is believed to be heard at  
intervals, more or less often, almost every year, in the stillness of  
a calm starlight or clear moonlight night. There is something, it  
is said, so wild, mysterious, and evidently superhuman in the  
sound, as to strike a chill of dread into the hearts of all who  
listen to it. The writer of an article on this subject, in the  
&ldquo;Marblehead Register&rdquo; of April 3, 1830, declares, that &ldquo;there  
are not wanting, at the present day, persons of unimpeachable  
veracity and known respectability, who still continue firmly to  
believe the tradition, and to assert that they themselves have been  
auditors of the sounds described, which they declare were of such  
an unearthly nature as to preclude the idea of imposition or  
deception.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>When &ldquo;the silver moon unclouded holds her way,&rdquo; or when  
the stars are glistening in the clear, cold sky, and the dark forms  
of the moored vessels are at rest upon the sleeping bosom of the  
harbor; when no natural sound comes forth from the animate or  
inanimate creation but the dull and melancholy rote of the sea  
along the rocky and winding coast, &mdash; how often is the watcher  
startled from the reveries of an excited imagination by the piteous,  
<pb n="520" id="vII520"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2533">  
<figDesc>Page 520.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
dismal, and terrific screams of the unlaid ghost of the murdered lady!</p>  
<p>A negro died, fifty years ago, in that part of Danvers called  
originally Salem Village, at a very advanced age. He was supposed to have reached his hundredth year. He never could be  
prevailed upon to admit that there was any delusion or mistake in  
the proceedings of 1692. To him, the whole affair was easy of  
explanation. He believed that the witchcraft was occasioned by  
the circumstance of the Devil's having purloined the church-book,  
and that it subsided so soon as the book was recovered from his  
grasp. Perhaps the particular hypothesis of the venerable African  
was peculiar to himself; but those persons must have a slight  
acquaintance with the history of opinions in this and every other  
country, who are not aware that the superstition on which it was  
founded has been extensively entertained by men of every color,  
almost, if not quite, up to the present day. If the doctrines of  
demonology have been completely overthrown and exterminated  
in our villages and cities, it is a very recent achievement; nay, I  
fear that in many places the auspicious event remains to take  
place.</p>  
<p>In the year 1808, the inhabitants of Great Paxton, a village of  
Huntingdonshire, in England, within sixty miles of London, rose  
in a body, attacked the house of an humble, and, so far as appears,  
inoffensive and estimable woman, named Ann Izard, suspected of  
bewitching three young females, &mdash; Alice Brown, Fanny Amey,  
and Mary Fox, &mdash; dragged her out of her bed into the fields,  
pierced her arms and body with pins, and tore her flesh with their  
nails, until she was covered with blood. They committed the  
same barbarous outrage upon her again, a short time afterwards;  
and would have subjected her to the water ordeal, had she not  
found means to fly from that part of the country.</p>  
<p>The writer of the article &ldquo;Witchcraft,&rdquo; in Rees's &ldquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia,&rdquo; gravely maintains the doctrine of &ldquo;ocular fascination.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Prosecutions for witchcraft are stated to have occurred, in the  
first half of the present century, in some of the interior districts of  
our Southern States. The civilized world is even yet full of necromancers and thaumaturgists of every kind. The science of  
&ldquo;palmistry&rdquo; is still practised by many a muttering vagrant; and  
perhaps some in this neighborhood remember when, in the days  
<pb n="521" id="vII521"/>

<figDesc>Page 521.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
  
of their youthful fancy, they held out their hands, that their future  
fortunes might be read in the lines of their palms, and their wild  
and giddy curiosity and anxious affections be gratified by information respecting wedding-day or absent lover.</p>  
<p>The most celebrated fortune-teller, perhaps, that ever lived,  
resided in an adjoining town. The character of &ldquo;Moll Pitcher&rdquo;  
is familiarly known in all parts of the commercial world. She died  
in 1813. Her place of abode was beneath the projecting and  
elevated summit of High Rock, in Lynn, and commanded a view  
of the wild and indented coast of Marblehead, of the extended  
and resounding beaches of Lynn and Chelsea, of Nahant Rocks,  
of the vessels and islands of Boston's beautiful bay, and of its  
remote southern shore. She derived her mysterious gifts by  
inheritance, her grandfather having practised them before in Marblehead. Sailors, merchants, and adventurers of every kind,  
visited her residence, and placed confidence in her predictions.  
People came from great distances to learn the fate of missing  
friends, or recover the possession of lost goods; while the young  
of both sexes, impatient of the tardy pace of time, and burning  
with curiosity to discern the secrets of futurity, availed themselves  
of every opportunity to visit her lowly dwelling, and hear from  
her prophetic lips the revelation of the most tender incidents and  
important events of their coming lives. She read the future, and  
traced what to mere mortal eyes were the mysteries of the present  
or the past, in the arrangement and aspect of the grounds or  
settlings of a cup of tea or coffee. Her name has everywhere  
become the generic title of fortune-tellers, and occupies a conspicuous place in the legends and ballads of popular superstition.  
Her renown has gone abroad to the farthest regions, and her  
memory will be perpetuated in the annals of credulity and imposture. An air of romance is breathed around the scenes where she  
practised her mystic art, the interest and charm of which will  
increase as the lapse of time removes her history back towards  
the dimness of the distant past.</p>  
<p>The elements of the witchcraft delusion of 1692 are slumbering  
still in the bosom of society. We hear occasionally of haunted  
houses, cases of second-sight, and communications from the spiritual world. It always will be so. The human mind feels instinctively its connection with a higher sphere. Some will ever be  
<pb n="522" id="vII522"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2535">  
<figDesc>Page 522.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
impatient of the restraints of our present mode of being, and  
prone to break away from them; eager to pry into the secrets of  
the invisible world, willing to venture beyond the bounds of ascertainable knowledge, and, in the pursuit of truth, to aspire where  
the laws of evidence cannot follow them. A love of the marvellous  
is inherent to the sense of limitation while in these terrestrial  
bodies; and many will always be found not content to wait until  
this tabernacle is dissolved and we shall be clothed upon with a  
body which is from Heaven.</p>

<note id="v2n9"><p>* The facts and considerations in reference to the authorship of the letter  
to Jonathan Corwin may be summarily stated as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<p>The letter is signed &ldquo;R. P.&rdquo; Under these initials is written, &ldquo;Robert  
Pain,&rdquo; in a different hand, and, as the ink as well as the chirography shows,  
at a somewhat later date. R. P. are blotted over, but with ink of such  
lighter hue that the original letters are clearly discernible under it. A Robert Paine graduated at Harvard College, in 1656. But he was probably the  
foreman of the grand jury that brought in all the indictments in the witchcraft trials; and therefore could not, from the declarations in the letter itself,  
have been its author. The only other person of that name at the time, of  
whom we have knowledge, was his father, who seems, by the evidence we  
have, to have died in 1693. (That date is given in the Harvard Triennial for  
the death of Robert Paine, the graduate; but erroneously, I think, as signatures to documents, and conveyances of property subsequently, can hardly be  
ascribed to any other person.) Robert Paine, the father, from the earliest settlement of Ipswich, had been one of the leading men of the town, apparently  
of larger property than any other, often its deputy in the General Court, and,  
for a great length of time, ruling elder of the church. &ldquo;Elder Pain,&rdquo; or Penn,  
as the name was often spelled, enjoyed the friendship of John Norton, and  
all the ministers far and near; and religious meetings were often held at his  
house. We know nothing to justify us in saying that he could not have been  
the author of this paper; but we also know nothing, except the appearance  
of his name upon it, to impute it to him.</p>  
<p>The document is dated from &ldquo;Salisbury.&rdquo; So far as we know, Elder Paine  
always lived in Ipswich; although, having property in the upper county, he  
may have often been, and possibly in his last years resided, there. It is, it is  
true, a strong circumstance, that his name is written, although by a late hand,  
under the initials. It shows that the person who wrote it thought that &ldquo;R. P.&rdquo;  
meant Robert Paine; but any one conversant especially with the antiquities of  
Ipswich, or this part of the county, might naturally fall into such a mistake.  
The authorship of documents was often erroneously ascribed. The words  
&ldquo;Robert Pain&rdquo; were, probably, not on the paper when the indorsement was  
made, &ldquo;A letter to my grandfather,&rdquo; &amp;c. Elder Robert Paine, if living in 1692,  
was ninety-one years of age. The document under consideration, if composed by him, is truly a marvellous production, &mdash; an intellectual phenomenon  
not easily to be paralleled.</p>  
<p>The facts in reference to Robert Pike, of Salisbury, as they bear upon the  
question of the authorship of the document, are these. He was seventy-six  
years of age in 1692, and had always resided in &ldquo;Salisbury.&rdquo; The letter and  
argument are both in the handwriting of Captain Thomas Bradbury, Recorder  
of old Norfolk County. On this point, there can be no question. Bradbury  
and Pike had been fellow-townsmen for more than half a century, connected  
by all the ties of neighborhood and family intermarriage, and jointly or alternately had borne all the civic and military honors the people could bestow.  
The document was prepared and delivered to the judge while Mrs. Bradbury  
was in prison, and just one month before her trial. Pike, as has been shown  
(p. 226), was deeply interested in her behalf. The original signature (&ldquo;R. P.&rdquo;)  
has the marked characteristics of the same initial letters as found in innumerable autographs of his, on file or record. There are interlineations, beyond question in Pike's handwriting. These facts demonstrate that both  
Pike and Bradbury were concerned in producing the document.</p>  
<p>The history of Robert Pike proves that he was a man of great ability, had  
a turn of mind towards logical exercises, and was, from early life, conversant with disputations. Nearly fifty years before, he argued in town-meeting  
against the propriety, in view of civil and ecclesiastical law, of certain acts  
of the General Court. They arraigned, disfranchised, and otherwise punished  
him for his &ldquo;litigiousness:&rdquo; but the weight of his character soon compelled  
them to restore his political rights; and the people of Salisbury, the very next  
year, sent him among them as their deputy, and continued him from time to  
time in that capacity. At a subsequent period, he was the leader and spokesman of a party in a controversy about some ecclesiastical affairs, involving  
apparently certain nice questions of theology, which created a great stir through  
the country. The contest reached so high a point, that the church at Salisbury excommunicated him; but the public voice demanded a council of  
churches, which assembled in September, 1676, and re-instated Major Pike  
condemning his excommunication, &ldquo;finding it not justifiable upon divers  
grounds.&rdquo; On this occasion, as before, the General Court frowned upon and  
denounced him; but the people came again to his rescue, sending him at the  
next election into the House of Deputies, and kept him there until raised to  
the Upper House as an Assistant. He was in the practice of conducting causes  
in the courts, and was long a local magistrate and one of the county  
judges.</p>  
<p>He does not appear to have been present at any of the trials or examinations of 1692; but his official position as Assistant caused many depositions  
taken in his neighborhood to be acknowledged and sworn before him. While  
entertaining the prevalent views about diabolical agency, he always disapproved of the proceedings of the Court in the particulars to which the arguments of the communication to Jonathan Corwin apply, &mdash; the &ldquo;spectre  
evidence,&rdquo; &mdash; and the statements and actings of &ldquo;the afflicted children.&rdquo;  
There are indications that sometimes he saw through the folly of the stories  
told by persons whose depositions he was called to attest. One John Pressy  
was circulating a wonderful tale about an encounter he had with the spectre  
of Susanna Martin. Pike sent for him, and took his deposition. Pressy  
averred, that, one evening, coming from Amesbury Ferry, he fell in with the  
shape of Martin in the form of a body of light, which &ldquo;seemed to be about  
the bigness of a half-bushel.&rdquo; After much dodging and man&oelig;uvring, and  
being lost and bewildered, wandering to and fro, tumbling into holes, &mdash; where,  
as the deposition states, no &ldquo;such pitts&rdquo; were known to exist, &mdash; and other  
misadventures, he came to blows with the light, and had several brushes with  
it, striking it with his stick. At one time, &ldquo;he thinks he gave her at least  
forty blows.&rdquo; He finally succeeded in finding &ldquo;his own house: but, being  
then seized with fear, could not speak till his wife spoke to him at the door,  
and was in such a condition that the family was afraid of him; which story  
being carried to the town the next day, it was, upon inquiry, understood, that  
said Goodwife Martin was in such a miserable case and in such pain that they  
swabbed her body, as was reported.&rdquo; He concludes his deposition by saying,  
that Major Pike &ldquo;seemed to be troubled that this deponent had not told him  
of it in season that she might have been viewed to have seen what her all  
was.&rdquo; The affair had happened &ldquo;about twenty-four years ago.&rdquo; Probably  
neither Pressy nor the Court appreciated the keenness of the major's expression of regret. It broke the bubble of the deposition. The whole story was  
the product of a benighted imagination, disordered by fear, filled with inebriate vagaries, exaggerated in nightmare, and resting upon wild and empty  
rumors. Robert Pike's course, in the case of Mrs. Bradbury, harmonizes with  
the supposition that he was Corwin's correspondent.</p>  
<p>Materials may be brought to light that will change the evidence on the  
point. It may be found that Elder Paine died before 1692: that would dispose  
of the question. It may appear that he was living in Salisbury at the time,  
and acted with Pike and Bradbury, they giving to the paper the authority of  
his venerable name and years. But all that is now known, constrains me to  
the conclusion stated in the text.</p></note>  
<note id="v2n10"><p>* As an illustration of the oblivion that had settled over the details of the  
transactions and characters connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, it may  
be mentioned, that when, thirty-five years ago, I prepared the work entitled  
`Lectures on Witchcraft; comprising a History of the Delusion in 1692,' although professional engagements prevented my making the elaborate exploration that has now been given to the subject, I extended the investigation over  
the ordinary fields of research, and took particular pains to obtain information brought down by tradition, gleaned all that could be gathered from the  
memories of old persons then living of what they had heard from their predecessors, and sought for every thing that local antiquaries and genealogists could  
contribute. I find, by the methods of inquiry adopted in the preparation of  
the present work, how inadequate and meagre was the knowledge then possessed. Most of the persons accused and executed, like Giles Corey, his wife  
Martha, and Bridget Bishop, were supposed to have been of humble, if not  
mean condition, of vagrant habits, and more or less despicable repute. By  
following the threads placed in my hands, in the files of the county-offices of  
Registry of Deeds and Wills, and documents connected with trials at law, and  
by a collation of conveyances and the administration of estates, I find that  
Corey, however eccentric or open to criticism in some features of character  
and passages of his life, was a large landholder, and a man of singular force  
and acuteness of intellect; while his wife had an intelligence in advance of  
her times, and was a woman of eminent piety. The same is found to have been  
the case with most of those who suffered.</p>  
<p>The reader may judge of my surprise in now discovering, that, while  
at different times. Neither are records always to be relied upon as to precision. In the record-book of the village church, Mr. Parris enters the age  
of Mrs. Ann Putnam, at the date of her admission, June 4, 1691, as &ldquo;Ann:  
&aelig;tat: 27.&rdquo; But an &ldquo;Account of the Early Settlers of Salisbury,&rdquo; in the  
&ldquo;New-England Historical and Genealogical Register,&rdquo; vol. vii. p. 314, gives  
the date of her birth &ldquo;15, 4, 1661.&rdquo; Her age is stated above according to  
this last authority; and, if correct, she was not so young, at the time of her  
marriage, as intimated (vol. i. p. 253), but seventeen years five months and  
ten days. It is difficult, however, to conceive how Parris, who was careful  
about such matters, and undoubtedly had his information from her own lips,  
could have been so far out of the way. Her brother, William Carr, in 1692,  
deposed that he was then forty-one years of age or thereabouts; whereas,  
the &ldquo;Account of the Early Settlers of Salisbury,&rdquo; just referred to, gives the  
date of his birth &ldquo;15, 1, 1648.&rdquo; It is indeed singular, that two members of  
a family of their standing should have been under an error as to their own  
age; one to an extent of almost, the other of some months more than,  
three years.</p></note>  
<note id="v2n11"><p>* The following passage is from the parish records: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;On the 3d of February, 1693, a warrant was issued for a meeting of the  
inhabitants of the village, signed by Thomas Preston, Joseph Pope, Joseph  
Houlton, and John Tarbell, of the standing annual committee, to be held  
Feb. 14, &ldquo;to consider and agree and determine who are capable of voting  
in our public transactions, by the power given us by the General-court order  
at our first settlement; and to consider of and make void a vote in our book  
of records, on the 18th of June, 1689, where there is a salary of sixty-six  
pounds stated to Mr. Parris, he not complying with it; also to consider of  
and make void several votes in the book of records on the 10th of October,  
1692, where our ministry house and barn and two acres of land seem to be  
conveyed from us after a fraudulent manner.&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>At this meeting, it was voted, that &ldquo;all men that are ratable, or hereafter  
shall be living within that tract of land mentioned in our General-court  
order, shall have liberty in nominating and appointing a committee, and  
voting in any of our public concerns.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>By referring to the account, in the First Part, of the controversy between  
the inhabitants of the village and Mr. Bayley, &ldquo;the power&rdquo; above alluded  
to, &ldquo;given us by the General Court,&rdquo; will be seen fully described. In its  
earnestness to fasten Mr. Bayley upon &ldquo;the inhabitants,&rdquo; the Court elaborately ordained the system by which they should be constrained to provide for  
him, and compelled to raise the means of paying his salary. As no church  
had then been organized, the General Court fastened the duty upon &ldquo;householders.&rdquo; The fact had not been forgotten, and the above vote showed that  
the parish intended to hold on to the power then given them. This highly  
incensed the Court of Sessions. It ordered the parish book of records to be  
produced before it, and caused a condemnation of such a claim of right to  
be written out, in open Court, on the face of the record, where it is now to be  
seen. It is as follows: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;At the General Sessions of the Peace holden at Ipswich, March the  
28th, 1693. This Court having viewed and considered the above agreement  
or vote contained in the last five lines, finding the same to be repugnant  
to the laws of this province, do declare the same to be null and void, and  
that this order be recorded with the records of this Court.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italics">To all my Christian Friends and Acquaintance, the Inhabitants of Salem Village.</hi></p>  
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Christian Friends,</hi> &mdash; The sermon here presented unto you was delivered in your audience by that unworthy instrument who did formerly  
spend some years among you in the work of the ministry, though attended  
with manifold sinful failings and infirmities, for which I do implore the pardoning mercy of God in Jesus Christ, and entreat from you the covering of  
love. As this was prepared for that particular occasion when it was delivered  
amongst you, so the publication of it is to be particularly recommended to  
your service.</p>  
<p>My heart's desire and continual prayer to God for you all is, that you  
may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ; and, accordingly, that all  
means he is using with you, by mercies and afflictions, ordinances and providences, may be sanctified to the building you up in grace and holiness, and  
preparing you for the kingdom of glory. We are told by the apostle (Acts  
xiv. 22), that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of  
God. Now, since (besides your share in the common calamities, under the  
burden whereof this poor people are groaning at this time) the righteous and  
holy God hath been pleased to permit a sore and grievous affliction to befall  
you, such as can hardly be said to be common to men; viz., by giving liberty  
to Satan to range and rage amongst you, to the torturing the bodies and  
distracting the minds of some of the visible sheep and lambs of the Lord  
Jesus Christ. And (which is yet more astonishing) he who is the accuser  
of the brethren endeavors to introduce as criminal some of the visible subjects of Christ's kingdom, by whose sober and godly conversation in times

past we could draw no other conclusions than that they were real members  
of his mystical body, representing them as the instruments of his malice  
against their friends and neighbors.</p>  
<p>I thought meet thus to give you the best assistance I could, to help you  
out of your distresses. And since the ways of the Lord, in his permissive as  
well as effective providence, are unsearchable, and his doings past finding  
out, and pious souls are at a loss what will be the issue of these things, I  
therefore bow my knees unto the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
that he would cause all grace to abound to you and in you, that your poor  
place may be delivered from those breaking and ruining calamities which are  
threatened as the pernicious consequences of Satan's malicious operations;  
and that you may not be left to bite and devour one another in your sacred  
or civil society, in your relations or families, to the destroying much good and  
promoting much evil among you, so as in any kind to weaken the hands or  
discourage the heart of your reverend and pious pastor, whose family also  
being so much under the influence of these troubles, spiritual sympathy cannot but stir you up to assist him as at all times, so especially at such a time as  
this; he, as well as his neighbors, being under such awful circumstances. As  
to this discourse, my humble desire and endeavor is, that it may appear to be  
according to the form of sound words, and in expressions every way intelligible to the meanest capacities. It pleased God, of his free grace, to give it  
some acceptation with those that heard it, and some that heard of it desired  
me to transcribe it, and afterwards to give way to the printing of it. I present it therefore to your acceptance, and commend it to the divine benediction; and that it may please the Almighty God to manifest his power in  
putting an end to your sorrows of this nature, by bruising Satan under your  
feet shortly, causing these and all other your and our troubles to work  
together for our good now, and salvation in the day of the Lord, is the  
unfeigned desire, and shall be the uncessant prayer, of&mdash;</p>

<p rend="center">[Appended to his Sermon, London edition, 1704.]</p>  
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">At</hi> the request of several worthy ministers and Christian friends, I do here  
annex, by way of appendix to the preceding sermon, some brief account of  
those amazing things which occasioned that discourse to be delivered. Let  
the reader please therefore to take it in the brief remarks following, and judge  
as God shall incline him.</p>  
<p>It pleased God, in the year of our Lord 1692, to visit the people at a place  
called Salem Village, in New England, with a very sore and grievous affliction, in which they had reason to believe that the sovereign and holy God  
was pleased to permit Satan and his instruments to affright and afflict those  
poor mortals in such an astonishing and unusual manner.</p>  
<p>Now, I having for some time before attended the work of the ministry in  
that village, the report of those great afflictions came quickly to my notice,  
and the more readily because the first person afflicted was in the minister's  
family who succeeded me after I was removed from them. In pity, therefore,  
to my Christian friends and former acquaintance there, I was much concerned about them, frequently consulted with them, and fervently, by divine  
assistance, prayed for them; but especially my concern was augmented when  
it was reported, at an examination of a person suspected for witchcraft, that  
my wife and daughter, who died three years before, were sent out of the  
world under the malicious operations of the infernal powers, as is more fully  
represented in the following remarks. I did then desire, and was also desired by some concerned in the Court, to be there present, that I might hear  
what was alleged in that respect; observing, therefore, when I was amongst  
them, that the case of the afflicted was very amazing and deplorable, and the  
charges brought against the accused such as were ground of suspicions, yet  
very intricate, and difficult to draw up right conclusions about them; I  
thought good, for the satisfaction of myself and such of my friends as might  
be curious to inquire into those mysteries of God's providence and Satan's  
malice, to draw up and keep by me a brief account of the most remarkable  
things that came to my knowledge in those affairs, which remarks were afterwards (at my request) revised and corrected by some who sat judges on the  
bench in those matters, and were now transcribed from the same paper on  
which they were then written. After this, I being by the providence of God  
<pb n="528" id="vII528"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2541">  
<figDesc>Page 528.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
called over into England in the year 1696, I then brought that paper of remarks on the witchcraft with me; upon the sight thereof some worthy ministers  
and Christian friends here desired me to reprint the sermon, and subjoin the  
remarks thereunto in way of appendix; but for some particular reasons I did  
then decline it. But now, forasmuch as I myself had been an eye and ear witness of most of those amazing things, so far as they came within the notice  
of human senses, and the requests of my friends were renewed since I came  
to dwell in London, I have given way to the publishing of them, that I may  
satisfy such as are not resolved to the contrary, that there may be (and are)  
such operations of the powers of darkness on the bodies and minds of mankind by divine permission and that those who sat judges on those cases may,  
by the serious consideration of the formidable aspect and perplexed circumstances of that afflictive providence, be in some measure excused, or at least  
be less censured, for passing sentence on several persons as being the instruments of Satan in those diabolical operations, when they were involved in  
such a dark and dismal scene of providence, in which Satan did seem to spin  
a finer thread of spiritual wickedness than in the ordinary methods of witchcraft: hence the judges, desiring to bear due testimony against such diabolical  
practices, were inclined to admit the validity of such a sort of evidence as was  
not so clearly and directly demonstrable to human senses as in other cases is  
required, or else they could not discover the mysteries of witchcraft. I presume not to impose upon my Christian or learned reader any opinion of  
mine how far Satan was an instrument in God's hand in these amazing  
afflictions which were on many persons there about that time; but I am  
certainly convinced, that the great God was pleased to lengthen his chain to  
a very great degree for the hurting of some and reproaching of others, as far  
as he was permitted so to do. Now, that I may not grieve any whose relations were either accused or afflicted in those times of trouble and distress,  
I choose to lay down every particular at large, without mentioning any  
names or persons concerned (they being wholly unknown here); resolving to  
confine myself to such a proportion of paper as is assigned to these remarks  
in this impression of the book, yet, that I may be distinct, shall speak briefly  
to the matter under three heads; viz.: &mdash;</p>  
<p>1. Relating to the afflicted.</p>  
<p>2. Relating to the accused. And,</p>  
<p>3. Relating to the confessing witches.</p>  
<p>To begin with the afflicted. &mdash;</p>  
<p>1. One or two of the first that were afflicted complaining of unusual illness, their relations used physic for their cure; but it was altogether in  
vain.</p>  
<p>2. They were oftentimes very stupid in their fits, and could neither hear  
nor understand, in the apprehension of the standers-by; so that, when prayer  
hath been made with some of them in such a manner as might be audible in  
a great congregation, yet, when their fit was off, they declared they did not  
hear so much as one word thereof.</p>  
<pb n="529" id="vII529"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2542">  
<figDesc>Page 529.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
  
<p>3. It was several times observed, that, when they were discoursed with  
about God or Christ, or the things of salvation, they were presently afflicted  
at a dreadful rate; and hence were oftentimes outrageous, if they were permitted to be in the congregation in the time of the public worship.</p>  
<p>4. They sometimes told at a considerable distance, yea, several miles off,  
that such and such persons were afflicted, which hath been found to be done  
according to the time and manner they related it; and they said the spectres  
of the suspected persons told them of it.</p>  
<p>5. They affirmed that they saw the ghosts of several departed persons,  
who, at their appearing, did instigate them to discover such as (they said)  
were instruments to hasten their deaths, threatening sorely to afflict them if  
they did not make it known to the magistrates. They did affirm at the  
examination, and again at the trial of an accused person, that they saw the  
ghosts of his two wives (to whom he had carried very ill in their lives, as was  
proved by several testimonies), and also that they saw the ghosts of my wife  
and daughter (who died above three years before); and they did affirm, that,  
when the very ghosts looked on the prisoner at the bar, they looked red, as  
if the blood would fly out of their faces with indignation at him. The manner of it was thus: several afflicted being before the prisoner at the bar, on a  
sudden they fixed all their eyes together on a certain place of the floor before  
the prisoner, neither moving their eyes nor bodies for some few minutes, nor  
answering to any question which was asked them: so soon as that trance  
was over, some being removed out of sight and hearing, they were all, one  
after another, asked what they saw; and they did all agree that they saw  
those ghosts above mentioned. I was present, and heard and saw the whole  
of what passed upon that account, during the trial of that person who was  
accused to be the instrument of Satan's malice therein.</p>  
<p>6. In this (worse than Gallick) persecution by the dragoons of hell, the  
persons afflicted were harassed at such a dreadful rate to write their names  
in a Devil-book presented by a spectre unto them: and one, in my hearing,  
said, &ldquo;I will not, I will not write! It is none of God's book, it is none of  
God's book: it is the Devil's book, for aught I know;&rdquo; and, when they  
steadfastly refused to sign, they were told, if they would but touch, or take  
hold of, the book, it should do; and, lastly, the diabolical propositions were  
so low and easy, that, if they would but let their clothes, or any thing about  
them, touch the book, they should be at ease from their torments, it being  
<unclear></unclear> consent that is aimed at by the Devil in those representations and  
operations.</p>  
<p>7. One who had been long afflicted at a stupendous rate by two or three  
spectres, when they were (to speak after the manner of men) tired out with  
tormenting of her to force or fright her to sign a covenant with the Prince of  
Darkness, they said to her, as in a diabolical and accursed passion, &ldquo;Go  
your ways, and the Devil go with you; for we will be no more pestered and  
plagued about you.&rdquo; And, ever after that, she was well, and no more afflicted, that ever I heard of.</p>  
<pb n="530" id="vII530"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2543">  
<figDesc>Page 530.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>8. Sundry pins have been taken out of the wrists and arms of the  
afflicted; and one, in time of examination of a suspected person, had a pin  
run through both her upper and her lower lip when she was called to speak,  
yet no apparent festering followed thereupon, after it was taken out.</p>  
<p>9. Some of the afflicted, as they were striving in their fits in open court,  
have (by invisible means) had their wrists bound fast together with a real  
cord, so as it could hardly be taken off without cutting. Some afflicted have  
been found with their arms tied, and hanged upon an hook, from whence  
others have been forced to take them down, that they might not expire in  
that posture.</p>  
<p>10. Some afflicted have been drawn under tables and beds by undiscerned force, so as they could hardly be pulled out; and one was drawn  
half-way over the side of a well, and was, with much difficulty, recovered  
back again.</p>  
<p>11. When they were most grievously afflicted, if they were brought to  
the accused, and the suspected person's hand but laid upon them, they were  
immediately relieved out of their tortures; but, if the accused did but look  
on them, they were instantly struck down again. Wherefore they used to  
cover the face of the accused, while they laid their hands on the afflicted,  
and then it obtained the desired issue: for it hath been experienced (both in  
examinations and trials), that, so soon as the afflicted came in sight of the  
accused, they were immediately cast into their fits; yea, though the accused  
were among the crowd of people unknown to the sufferers, yet, on the first  
view, were they struck down, which was observed in a child of four or five  
years of age, when it was apprehended, that so many as she could look  
upon, either directly or by turning her head, were immediately struck into  
their fits.</p>  
<p>12. An iron spindle of a woollen wheel, being taken very strangely out  
of an house at Salem Village, was used by a spectre as an instrument of  
torture to a sufferer, not being discernible to the standers-by, until it was, by  
the said sufferer, snatched out of the spectre's hand, and then it did immediately appear to the persons present to be really the same iron spindle.</p>  
<p>13. Sometimes, in their fits, they have had their tongues drawn out of  
their mouths to a fearful length, their heads turned very much over their  
shoulders; and while they have been so strained in their fits, and had their  
arms and legs, &amp;c., wrested as if they were quite dislocated, the blood hath  
gushed plentifully out of their mouths for a considerable time together,  
which some, that they might be satisfied that it was real blood, took upon  
their finger, and rubbed on their other hand. I saw several together thus  
violently strained and bleeding in their fits, to my very great astonishment  
that my fellow-mortals should be so grievously distressed by the invisible  
powers of darkness. For certainly all considerate persons who beheld these  
things must needs be convinced, that their motions in their fits were preternatural and involuntary, both as to the manner, which was so strange as a  
well person could not (at least without great pain) screw their bodies into,  
<pb n="531" id="vII531"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2544">  
<figDesc>Page 531.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
and as to the violence also, they were preternatural motions, being much  
beyond the ordinary force of the same persons when they were in their right  
minds; so that, being such grievous sufferers, it would seem very hard and  
unjust to censure them of consenting to, or holding any voluntary converse  
or familiarity with, the Devil.</p>  
<p>14. Their eyes were, for the most part, fast closed in their trance-fits, and  
when they were asked a question they could give no answer; and I do  
verily believe, they did not hear at that time; yet did they discourse with  
the spectres as with real persons, asserting things and receiving answers  
affirmative or negative, as the matter was. For instance, one, in my hearing,  
thus argued <hi rend="italics">with,</hi> and railed <hi rend="italics">at,</hi> a spectre: &ldquo;Goodw&mdash;, begone, begone, begone! Are you not ashamed, a woman of your profession, to afflict a poor  
creature so? What hurt did I ever do you in my life? You have but two  
years to live, and then the Devil will torment your soul for this. Your name  
is blotted out of God's book, and it shall never be put into God's book  
again. Begone! For shame! Are you not afraid of what is coming upon  
you? I know, I know what will make you afraid, &mdash; the wrath of an angry  
God: I am sure that will make you afraid. Begone! Do not torment me.  
I know what you would have&rdquo; (we judged she meant her soul): &ldquo;but it is  
out of your reach; it is clothed with the white robes of Christ's righteousness.&rdquo; This sufferer I was well acquainted with, and knew her to be a very  
sober and pious woman, so far as I could judge; and it appears that she had  
not, in that fit, voluntary converse with the Devil, for then she might have  
been helped to a better guess about that woman abovesaid, as to her living  
but two years, for she lived not many months after that time. Further, this  
woman, in the same fit, seemed to dispute with a spectre about a text of  
Scripture: the apparition seemed to deny it; she said she was sure there was  
such a text, and she would tell it; and then said she to the apparition, &ldquo;I am  
sure you will be gone, for you cannot stand before that text.&rdquo; Then was she  
sorely afflicted, &mdash; her mouth drawn on one side, and her body strained  
violently for about a minute; and then said, &ldquo;It is, it is, it is,&rdquo; three or four  
times, and then was afflicted to hinder her from telling; at last, she broke  
forth, and said, &ldquo;It is the third chapter of the Revelations.&rdquo; I did manifest  
some scruple about reading it, lest Satan should draw any thereby superstitiously to improve the word of the eternal God; yet judging I might do it  
once, for an experiment, I began to read; and, before I had read through the  
first verse, she opened her eyes, and was well. Her husband and the spectators told me she had often been relieved by reading texts pertinent to her  
case, &mdash; as Isa. 40, 1, ch. 49, 1, ch. 50, 1, and several others. These things I  
saw and heard from her.</p>  
<p>15. They were vehemently afflicted, to hinder any persons praying with  
them, or holding them in any religious discourse. The woman mentioned in  
the former section was told by the spectre I should not go to prayer; but she  
said I should, and, after I had done, reasoned with the apparition, &ldquo;Did not  
I say he should go to prayer?&rdquo; I went also to visit a person afflicted in  
<pb n="532" id="vII532"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2545">  
<figDesc>Page 532.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Boston; and, after I was gone into the house to which she belonged, she  
being abroad, and pretty well, when she was told I was there, she said, &ldquo;I  
am loath to go in; for I know he will fall into some good discourse, and then  
I am sure I shall go into a fit.&rdquo; Accordingly, when she came in, I advised  
her to improve all the respite she had to make her peace with God, and sue  
out her pardon through Jesus Christ, and beg supplies of faith and every  
grace to deliver her from the powers of darkness; and, before I had uttered  
all this, she fell into a fearful fit of diabolical torture.</p>  
<p>16. Some of them were asked how it came to pass that they were not  
affrighted when they saw the <hi rend="italics">black-man:</hi> they said they were at first, but not  
so much afterwards.</p>  
<p>17. Some of them affirmed they saw the <hi rend="italics">black-man</hi> sit on the gallows, and  
that he whispered in the ears of some of the condemned persons when they  
were just ready to be turned off, even while they were making their last  
speech.</p>  
<p>18. They declared several things to be done by witchcraft, which happened before some of them were born, &mdash; as strange deaths of persons, casting  
away of ships, &amp;c.; and they said the spectres told them of it.</p>  
<p>19. Some of them have sundry times seen a <hi rend="italics">white-man</hi> appearing amongst  
the spectres, and, as soon as he appeared, the <hi rend="italics">black-witches</hi> vanished: they said  
this white-man had often foretold them what respite they should have from  
their fits, as sometimes a day or two or more, which fell out accordingly.  
One of the afflicted said she saw him, in her fit, and was with him in a glorious place which had no candle nor sun, yet was full of light and brightness,  
where there was a multitude in white, glittering robes, and they sang the  
song in Rev. 5, 9; Psal. 110, 149. She was loath to leave that place, and  
said, &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">How long shall I stay here? Let me be along with you.</hi>&rdquo; She was  
grieved she could stay no longer in that place and company.</p>  
<p>20. A young woman that was afflicted at a fearful rate had a spectre  
appeared to her with a white sheet wrapped about it, not visible to the standers until this sufferer (violently striving in her fit) snatched at, took hold,  
and tore off a corner of that sheet. Her father, being by her, endeavored to  
lay hold upon it with her, that she might retain what she had gotten; but, at  
the passing-away of the spectre, he had such a violent twitch of his hand as  
if it would have been torn off: immediately thereupon appeared in the sufferer hand the corner of a sheet, &mdash; a real cloth, <hi rend="italics">visible</hi> to the spectators, which  
(as it is said) remains still to be seen.</p>  
<p rend="center">REMARKABLE THINGS RELATING TO THE ACCUSED.</p>  
<p>1. A woman, being brought upon public examination, desired to go to  
prayer. The magistrates told her they came not there to hear her pray, but  
to examine her in what was alleged against her relating to suspicions of  
witchcraft.</p>  
<p>2. It was observed, both in times of examination and trial, that the  
<pb n="533" id="vII533"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2546">  
<figDesc>Page 533.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
accused seemed little affected with what the sufferers underwent, or what was  
charged against them as being the instruments of Satan therein, so that the  
spectators were grieved at their unconcernedness.</p>  
<p>3. They were sometimes their <hi rend="italics">own image,</hi> and not always practising upon  
poppets made of clouts, wax, or other materials, (according to the old methods of witchcraft); for <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> actions in them seemed to produce preternatural impressions on the afflicted, as biting their lips in time of examination  
and trial caused the sufferers to be bitten so as they produced the marks  
before the magistrates and spectators: the accused pinching their hands  
together seemed to cause the sufferers to be <hi rend="italics">pinched;</hi> those again <hi rend="italics">stamping</hi>  
with their feet, <hi rend="italics">these</hi> were tormented in their legs and feet, so as they <hi rend="italics">stamped  
fearfully.</hi> After all this, if the accused did but lean against the bar at  
which they stood, some very sober women of the afflicted complained of their  
breasts, as if their bowels were torn out; thus, some have since confessed,  
they were wont to afflict such as were the objects of their malice.</p>  
<p>4. Several were accused of having familiarity with the <hi rend="italics">black-man</hi> in time  
of examination and trial; and that he whispered in their ears, and therefore  
they could not hear the magistrates; and that one woman accused rid (in  
her shape and spectre) by the place of judicature, behind the black man, in  
the very time when she was upon examination.</p>  
<p>5. When the suspected were standing at the bar, the afflicted have affirmed  
that they saw their shapes in other places suckling a yellow bird; sometimes in one place and posture, and sometimes in another. They also foretold that the spectre of the prisoner was going to afflict such or such a sufferer,  
which presently fell out accordingly.</p>  
<p>6. They were accused by the sufferers to keep days of hellish fasts and  
thanksgivings; and, upon one of their fast-days, they told a sufferer she must  
not eat, it was fast-day. She said she would: they told her they would  
choke her then, which, when she did eat, was endeavored.</p>  
<p>7. They were also accused to hold and administer diabolical sacraments;  
viz., a mock-baptism and a Devil-supper, at which cursed imitations of the  
sacred institutions of our blessed Lord they used forms of words to be trembled at in the very rehearsing: concerning baptism I shall speak elsewhere.  
At their cursed supper, they were said to have red bread and red drink; and,  
when they pressed an afflicted person to eat and drink thereof, she turned  
away her head, and spit at it, and said, &ldquo;I will not eat, I will not drink: it  
is blood. That is not the bread of life, that is not the water of life; and I will  
have none of yours.&rdquo; Thus horribly doth Satan endeavor to have his kingdom and administrations to resemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p>8. Some of the most <hi rend="italics">sober</hi> afflicted persons, when they were well, did  
affirm the spectres of such and such as they did complain of in their fits did  
appear to them, and could relate what passed betwixt them and the apparitions, after their fits were over, and give account after what manner they  
were hurt by them.</p>  
<p>9. Several of the accused would neither in time of examination nor trial  
<pb n="534" id="vII534"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2547">  
<figDesc>Page 534.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
confess any thing of what was laid to their charge: some would not admit of  
any minister to pray with them, others refused to pray for themselves. It  
was said by some of the confessing witches, that such as have received the  
Devil-sacrament can never confess: only one woman condemned, after  
the death-warrant was signed, freely confessed, which occasioned her reprieval for some time; and it was observable this woman had one lock of  
hair of a very great length, viz., four foot and seven inches long by measure.  
This lock was of a different color from all the rest, which was short and  
gray. It grew on the hinder part of her head, and was matted together like  
an elf-lock. The Court ordered it to be cut off, to which she was very unwilling, and said she was told if it were cut off she should die or be sick;  
yet the Court ordered it so to be.</p>  
<p>10. A person who had been frequently transported to and fro by the devils  
for the space of near two years, was struck dumb for about nine months of  
that time; yet he, after that, had his speech restored to him, and did depose upon oath, that, in the time while he was dumb, he was many times  
bodily transported to places where the witches were gathered together, and  
that he there saw feasting and dancing; and, being struck on the back or  
shoulder, was thereby made fast to the place, and could only see and hear at  
a distance. He did take his oath that he did, with his bodily eyes, see some  
of the accused at those witch-meetings several times. I was present in court  
when he gave his testimony. He also proved by sundry persons, that, at those  
times of transport, he was bodily absent from his abode, and could nowhere  
be found, but being met with by some on the road, at a distance from his  
home, was suddenly conveyed away from them.</p>  
<p>11. The afflicted persons related that the spectres of several eminent persons had been brought in amongst the rest; but, as the sufferers said the  
Devil could not hurt them in their shapes, but two witches seemed to take  
them by each hand, and lead them or force them to come in.</p>  
<p>12. Whiles a godly man was at prayer with a woman afflicted, the  
daughter of that woman (being a sufferer in the like kind) affirmed that she  
saw two of the persons accused at prayer to the Devil.</p>  
<p>13. It was proved by substantial evidences against one person accused,  
that he had such an unusual strength (though a very little man), that he  
could hold out a gun with one hand behind the lock, which was near seven  
foot in the barrel, being as much as a lusty man could command with both  
hands after the usual manner of shooting. It was also proved, that he lifted  
barrels of meat and barrels of molasses out of a canoe alone, and that putting  
his fingers into a barrel of molasses (full within a finger's length according to  
custom) he carried it several paces; and that he put his finger into the  
muzzle of a gun which was more than five foot in the barrel, and lifted up  
the butt-end thereof, lock, stock, and all, without any visible help to raise it.  
It was also testified, that, being abroad with his wife and his wife's brother,  
he occasionally staid behind, letting his wife and her brother walk forward;  
but, suddenly coming up with them, he was angry with his wife for what  
<pb n="535" id="vII535"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2548">  
<figDesc>Page 535.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
discourse had passed betwixt her and her brother: they wondering how he  
should know it, he said, &ldquo;I know your thoughts;&rdquo; at which expression, they,  
being amazed, asked him how he could do that; he said, &ldquo;My God, whom I  
serve, makes known your thoughts to me.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>I was present when these things were testified against him, and observed  
that he could not make any plea for himself (in these things) that had any  
weight: he had the liberty of challenging his jurors before empanelling, according to the statute in that case, and used his liberty in challenging many;  
yet the jury that were sworn brought him in guilty.</p>  
<p>14. The magistrates privately examined a child of four or five years of  
age, mentioned in the remarks of the afflicted, sect. 11: [p. 530] and the  
child told them it had a little snake which used to suck on the lowest joint  
of its forefinger; and, when they (inquiring where) pointed to other places,  
it told them not <hi rend="italics">there</hi> but <hi rend="italics">here,</hi> pointing on the lowest joint of the forefinger,  
where they observed a deep red spot about the bigness of a flea-bite. They  
asked it who gave it that snake, whether the black man gave it: the child  
said no, its mother gave it. I heard this child examined by the magistrates.</p>  
<p>15. It was proved by sundry testimonies against some of the accused, that,  
upon their malicious imprecations, wishes, or threatenings, many observable  
deaths and diseases, with many other odd inconveniences, have happened to  
cattle and other estate of such as were so threatened by them, and some  
to the persons of men and women.</p>  
<p rend="center">REMARKABLE THINGS CONFESSED BY SOME SUSPECTED OF BEING  
GUILTY OF WITCHCRAFT.</p>  
<p>1. It pleased God, for the clearer discovery of those mysteries of the  
kingdom of darkness, so to dispose, that several persons, men, women, and  
children, did confess their hellish deeds, as followeth: &mdash;</p>  
<p>2. They confessed against themselves that they were witches, told how  
long they had been so, and how it came about that the Devil appeared to  
them; viz., sometimes upon discontent at their mean condition in the world,  
sometimes about fine clothes, sometimes for the gratifying other carnal and  
sensual lusts. Satan then, upon his appearing to them, made them fair  
(though false) promises, that, if they would yield to him, and sign his book,  
their desires should be answered to the uttermost, whereupon they signed it;  
and thus the accursed confederacy was confirmed betwixt them and the  
Prince of Darkness.</p>  
<p>3. Some did affirm that there were some hundreds of the society of  
witches, considerable companies of whom were affirmed to muster in arms by  
beat of drum. In time of examinations and trials, they declared that such a  
man was wont to call them together from all quarters to witch-meetings with  
the sound of a diabolical trumpet.</p>  
<p>4. Being brought to see the prisoners at the bar upon their trials, they  
did affirm in open court (I was then present), that they had oftentimes seen  
<pb n="536" id="vII536"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2549">  
<figDesc>Page 536.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
them at witch-meetings, where was feasting, dancing, and jollity, as also at  
Devil-sacraments; and particularly that they saw such a man &mdash; amongst  
the rest of the cursed crew, and affirmed that he did administer the sacrament of Satan to them, encouraging them to go on in their way, and they  
should certainly prevail. They said also that such a woman &mdash; was a  
deacon, and served in distributing the diabolical elements: they affirmed that  
there were great numbers of the witches.</p>  
<p>5. They affirmed that many of those wretched souls had been baptized at  
Newbury Falls, and at several other rivers and ponds; and, as to the manner  
of administration, the great Officer of Hell took them up by the body, and,  
putting their heads into the water, said over them, &ldquo;Thou art mine, I have  
full power over thee: and thereupon they engaged and covenanted to renounce  
God, Christ, their sacred baptism, and the whole way of Gospel salvation,  
and to use their utmost endeavors to oppose the kingdom of Christ, and to  
set up and advance the kingdom of Satan.</p>  
<p>6. Some, after they had confessed, were very penitent, and did wring their  
hands, and manifest a distressing sense of what they had done, and were by  
the mercies of God recovered out of those snares of the kingdom of darkness.</p>  
<p>7. Several have confessed against their own mothers, that they were instruments to bring them into the Devil's covenant, to the undoing of them,  
body and soul; and some girls of eight or nine years of age did declare, that,  
after they were so betrayed by their mothers to the power of Satan, they saw  
the Devil go in their own shapes to afflict others.</p>  
<p>8. Some of those that confessed were immediately afflicted at a dreadful  
rate, after the same manner with the other sufferers.</p>  
<p>9. Some of them confessed, that they did afflict the sufferers according to  
the time and manner they were accused thereof; and, being asked what they  
did to afflict them, some said that they pricked pins into poppets made with  
rags, wax, and other materials: one that confessed after the signing the death said she used to afflict them by clutching and pinching her hands  
together, and wishing in what part and after what manner she would have  
them afflicted, and it was done.</p>  
<p>10. They confessed the design was laid by this witchcraft to root out the  
interest of Christ in New England, and that they began at the Village in  
order to settling the kingdom of darkness and the powers thereof; declaring  
that such a man &mdash; was to be head conjurer, and for his activity in that  
affair was to be crowned king of hell, and that such a woman &mdash; was to be  
queen of hell.</p>  
<p>Thus I have given my reader a brief and true account of those fearful  
and amazing operations and intrigues of the Prince of Darkness: and I must  
call them so; for, let some persons be as incredulous as they please about the  
powerful and malicious influence of evil angels upon the minds and bodies of  
mankind, <hi rend="italics">sure I am</hi> none that observed those things above mentioned could  
refer them to any other head than the sovereign permission of the holy God,

and the malicious operations of his and our implacable enemy. I have here  
related nothing more than what was acknowledged to be true by the judges  
that sat on the bench, and other credible persons there, which I have without  
prejudice or partiality represented.</p>  
<p>I therefore close all with my uncessant prayers, that the great and everlasting Jehovah would, for the sake of his blessed Son, our most glorious  
intercessor, rebuke Satan, and so vanquish him, from time to time, that his  
power may be more and more every day suppressed, his kingdom destroyed;  
and that all his malicious and accursed instruments in those spiritual wickednesses may gnash their teeth, melt away, and be ashamed in their secret  
places, till they come to be judged and condemned unto the place of everlasting burnings prepared for the Devil and his angels, that they may there  
be tormented with him for ever and ever.</p>

<dateline><name type="place" rend="smallcaps">Salisbury,</name> <date>Aug. 9, 1692.</date></dateline>  
</opener>  
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honored Sir,</hi> &mdash; According as in my former to you I hinted that I held  
myself obliged to give you some farther account of my rude though solemn  
thoughts of that great case now before you, the happy management whereof  
do so much conduce to the glory of God, the safety and tranquillity of the  
country, besides what I have said in my former and the enclosed, I further  
humbly present to consideration the doubtfulness and unsafety of admitting  
spectre testimony against the life of any that are of blameless conversation,  
and plead innocent, from the uncertainty of them and the incredulity of them;  
for as for diabolical visions, apparitions, or representations, they are more  
commonly false and delusive than real, and cannot be known when they are  
real and when feigned, but by the Devil's report; and then not to be  
believed, because he is the father of lies.</p>  
<p>1. Either the organ of the eye is abused and the senses deluded, so as to  
think they do see or hear some thing or person, when indeed they do not, and  
this is frequent with common jugglers.</p>  
<p>2. The Devil himself appears in the shape and likeness of a person or  
thing, when it is not the person or thing itself; so he did in the shape of  
Samuel.</p>  
<p>3. And sometimes persons or things themselves do really appear, but  
how it is possible for any one to give a true testimony, which possibly did see  
neither shape nor person, but were deluded; and if they did see any thing,  
they know not whether it was the person or but his shape. All that can be  
rationally or truly said in such a case is this, &mdash; that I did see the shape or  
likeness of such a person, if my senses or eyesight were not deluded: and  
they can honestly say no more, because they know no more (except the Devil  
tells them more); and if he do, they can but say he told them so. But the  
matter is still incredible: first, because it is but their saying the Devil told  
them so; if he did so tell them, yet the verity of the thing remains still unproved, because the Devil was a liar and a murtherer (John viii. 44), and  
may tell these lies to murder an innocent person.</p>  
<p>But this case seems to be solved by an assertion of some, that affirm that  
the Devil do not or cannot appear in the shape of a godly person, to do hurt:  
others affirm the contrary, and say that he can and often have so done, of  
<pb n="539" id="vII539"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2552">  
<figDesc>Page 539.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
which they give many instances for proof of what they say; which if granted,  
the case remains yet unsolved, and yet the very hinge upon which that  
weighty case depends. To which I humbly say: First, That I do lament  
that such a point should be so needful to be determined, which seems not  
probable, if possible, to be determined to infallible satisfaction for want of  
clear Scripture to decide it by, though very rational to be believed according  
to rules; as, for instance, if divers examples are alleged of the shape of persons that have been seen, of whom there is ample testimony that they lived  
and died in the faith, yet, saith the objecter, 'tis possible they may be hypocrites, therefore the proof not infallible: and as it may admit of such an  
objection against the reasons given on the affirmative, much more may the  
same objection be made against the negative, for which they can or do give  
no reason at all, nor can a negative be proved (therefore difficult to be determined to satisfy infallibly); but, seeing it must be discussed, I humbly offer  
these few words: First, I humbly conceive that the saints on earth are not  
more privileged in that case than the saints in heaven; but the Devil may  
appear in the shape of a saint in heaven, namely, in the shape of Samuel  
(1 Sam. xxviii. 13, 14); therefore he can or may represent the shape of a  
saint that is upon the earth. Besides, there may be innocent persons that  
are not saints, and their innocency ought to be their security, as well as godly  
men's; and I hear nobody question but the Devil may take their shape.</p>  
<p>Secondly, It doth not hurt any man or woman to present the shape or likeness of an innocent person, more than for a limner or carver to draw his  
picture, and show it, if he do not in that form do some evil (nor then neither)  
if the laws of man do not oblige him to suffer for what the Devil doth in his  
shape, the laws of God do not.</p>  
<p>Thirdly, The Devil had power, by God's permission, to take the very person  
of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the day or time of his humiliation, and carry  
him from place to place, and tempted him with temptations of horrid blasphemy, and yet left him innocent. Why may we not suppose the like may be  
done to a good man? And why not much more appear in his shape (or  
make folk think it is his shape, when indeed it is not), and yet the person be  
innocent, being far enough off, and not knowing of it, nor would consent if  
he had known it, his profession and conversation being otherwise?</p>  
<p>Fourthly, I suppose 'tis granted by all, that the person of one that is dead  
cannot appear, because the soul and body are separated, and so the person is  
dissolved, and so ceaseth to be: and it is as certain that the person of the  
living cannot be in two places at one time, but he that is at Boston cannot be  
at Salem or Cambridge at the same time; but as the malice and envy in the  
Devil makes it his business to seek whom he may devour, so no question but  
he doth infuse the same quality into those that leave Jesus Christ to embrace  
him, that they do envy those that are innocent, and upon that account be as  
ready to say and swear that they did see them as the Devil is to present their  
shape to them. Add but this also, that, when they are once under his power,  
he puts them on headlong (they must needs go whom the Devil drives, saith  
<pb n="540" id="vII540"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2553">  
<figDesc>Page 540.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
the proverb), and the reason is clear, &mdash; because they are taken captive by him,  
to do his will. And we see, by woful and undeniable experience, both in the  
afflicted persons and the confessors, some of them, that he torments them at  
his pleasure, to force them to accuse others. Some are apt to doubt they do  
but counterfeit; but, poor souls! I am utterly of another mind, and I lament  
them with all my heart; but, take which you please, the case is the same as  
to the main issue. For, if they counterfeit, the wickedness is the greater in  
them, and the less in the Devil: but if they be compelled to it by the Devil,  
against their wills, then the sin is the Devil's, and the sufferings theirs; but  
if their testimonies be allowed of, to make persons guilty by, the lives of  
innocent persons are alike in danger by them, which is the solemn consideration that do disquiet the country.</p>  
<p>Now, that the only wise God may so direct you in all, that he may  
have glory, the country peace and safety, and your hands strengthened in  
that great work, is the desire and constant prayer of your humble servant,  
R. P., who shall no further trouble you at present.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Position.</hi> &mdash; That to put a witch to death is the command of God, and  
therefore the indispensable duty of man, &mdash; namely, the magistrate (Ex. xxii.  
18); which, granted, resolves two questions that I have heard made by  
some: &mdash;</p>  
<p>First, Whether there are any such creatures as witches in the world.  
Secondly, If there be, whether they can be known to be such by men: both  
which must be determined on the affirmative, or else that commandment were  
in vain.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Position Second.</hi> &mdash; That it must be witches that are put to death, and not  
innocent persons: &ldquo;Thou shalt not condemn the innocent nor the righteous&rdquo;  
(Ex. xxiii. 7).</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Query.</hi> &mdash; Which premised, it brings to this query, &mdash; namely, how a witch  
may be known to be a witch.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> &mdash; First, By the mouth of two or three witnesses (Deut. xix. 15;  
Matt. xviii. 16; Deut. xvii. 6). Secondly, They may be known by their own  
confession, being <hi rend="italics">compos mentis,</hi> and not under horrid temptation to selfmurther (2 Sam. xvi.; Josh. vii. 16).</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Query Second.</hi> &mdash; What is it that those two or three witnesses must swear?  
Must they swear that such a person is a witch? Will that do the thing, as is  
vulgarly supposed?</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> &mdash; I think that is too unsafe to go by, as well as hard to be done  
by the advised: First, because it would expose the lives of all alike to the  
pleasure or passion of those that are minded to take them away; secondly,  
because that, in such a testimony, the witnesses are not only informers in  
matter of fact, but sole judges of the crime, &mdash; which is the proper work of the  
judges, and not of witnesses.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Query Third.</hi> &mdash; What is it that the witnesses must testify in the case, to  
prove one to be a witch?</p>  
<pb n="541" id="vII541"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2554">  
<figDesc>Page 541.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> &mdash; They must witness the person did put forth some act which, if  
true, was an act of witchcraft, or familiarity with the Devil, the witness  
attest the fact to be upon his certain knowledge, and the judges to judge.  
that fact to be such a crime.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Query Fourth.</hi> &mdash; What acts are they which must be proved to be committed by a person, that shall be counted legal proof of witchcraft, or familiarity with the Devil?</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> &mdash; This I do profess to be so hard a question, for want of light from  
the Word of God and laws of men, that I do not know what to say to it; and  
therefore humbly conceive, that, in such a difficulty, it may be more safe, for  
the present, to let a guilty person live till further discovery, than to put an  
innocent person to death.</p>  
<p>First, Because a guilty person may afterward be discovered, and so put  
to death; but an innocent person to be put to death cannot be brought again  
to life when once dead.</p>  
<p>Secondly, Because secret things belong to God only, but revealed things  
to us and to our children. And though it be so difficult sometimes, yet  
witches there are, and may be known by some acts or other put forth by  
them, that may render them such; for Scripture examples, I can remember  
but few in the Old Testament, besides Balaam (Num. xxii. 6, xxxi. 16).</p>  
<p>First, The sorcerers of Egypt could not tell the interpretation of Pharaoh's  
dream, though he told them his dream (Gen. xli 8): his successors afterwards had sorcerers, that by enchantments did, first, turn their rods into  
serpents (Exod. vii. 11, 12); second, turned water into blood; thirdly, brought  
frogs upon the land of Egypt (Exod. viii. 7).</p>  
<p>Thirdly, Nebuchadnezzar's magicians said that they would tell him the  
interpretation, if he would tell them his dream (Dan. iv. 7); but the king  
did not believe them (ver. 8, 9).</p>  
<p>Fourthly, The Witch of Endor raised the Devil, in the likeness of Samuel,  
to tell Saul his fortune; and Saul made use of him accordingly (1 Sam.  
xxviii. 8, 11-15); and, as for New Testament, I see very little of that  
nature. Our Lord Jesus Christ did cast out many devils, and so did his  
disciples, both while he was upon earth and afterward, of which some were  
dreadfully circumstanced (Mark ix. 18; Mark v. 2-5); but of witches,  
we only read of four mentioned in the apostles' time: first, Simon Magus  
(Acts viii. 9, 11); secondly, Elymas the sorcerer (Acts xiii. 6, 8); thirdly,  
the seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, that were vagabond Jews, &mdash; exorcists (Acts  
xix. 18-16); fourthly, the girl which, by a spirit of divination, brought  
her master much gain (Acts xvi. 16), whether it were by telling fortuns or  
finding out lost things, as our cunning men do, is not said; but something it  
was that was done by that spirit which was in her, which, being cast out, she  
could not do. Now, whatever was done by any of these, by the help of  
the Devil, or by virtue of familiarity with him, or that the Devil did do by  
their consent or instigation, it is that which, the like being now proved to be  
done by others, is legal conviction of witchcraft, or familiarity with the Devil.</p>

<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2555">  
<figDesc>Page 542.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p>As I remember, Mr. Perkins apprehends witchcraft may be sometimes  
committed by virtue of an implicit covenant with the Devil, though there be  
not explicit covenant visibly between them; namely, by using such words  
and gestures whereby they do intimate to the Devil what they would have  
him do, and he doth it.</p>  
<p>3. To tell events contingent, or to bring any thing to pass by supernatural means, or by no means.</p>  
<p>I have heard of some that make a circle, and mumble over some uncouth  
words; and some that have been spiteful and suspicious persons, that have  
sent for a handful of thatch from the house or barn of him that they have  
owed a spite to, and the house have been burnt as they had burnt the thatch  
that they fetched.</p>  
<p>When Captain Smith was cast away in the ship built by Mr. Stevens at  
Gloucester, many years ago, it was said that the woman that was accused for  
doing it did put a dish in a pail of water, and sent her girl several times to  
see the motion of the dish, till at last it was turned over, and then the  
woman said, &ldquo;Now Smith is gone,&rdquo; <hi rend="italics">or</hi> &ldquo;is cast away.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>A neighbor of mine, who was a Hampshire man, told me that a suspected  
woman desired something of some of the family, which being denied, she  
either muttered or threatened, and some evil suddenly followed, and they  
put her into a cart to carry her to Winchester; and, when they had gone a  
little way, the team could not move the cart, though in plain ground. The  
master commanded to carry a knitch of straw, and burn her in the cart;  
which to avoid, she said they should go along, and they did. This they did  
several times before they came to Winchester, of which passages the men  
that went with her gave their oaths, and she was executed.</p>  
<p>Some have been transformed into dogs, cats, hares, hogs, and other  
creatures; and in those shapes have sometimes received wounds which have  
made them undeniably guilty, and so confessed. Sometimes having their  
imps sucking them, or infallible tokens that they are sucked, in the search  
of which great caution to be given, because of some superfluities of nature,  
and diseases that people are incident unto, as the piles, &amp;c., of which the  
judges are, upon the testimony of the witnesses, to determine what of crime  
is proved by any of these circumstances, with many other, in which God is  
pleased many times, by some overt acts, to bring to light that secret wickedness to apparent conviction, sometimes by their own necessitated confession,  
whereby those that he hath commanded to be put to death may be known to  
be such, which, when known, then it is a duty to put them to death, and not  
before, though they were as guilty before as then.</p>  
<p>There are two queries more with respect to what is proper to us in this  
juncture of time, of which we have no account of the like being common at  
other times, or in other places; namely, these, &mdash;</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Query Fifth.</hi> &mdash; The fifth query is, what we are to think of those persons  
at Salem, or the Village, before whom people are brought for detection, or  
otherwise to be concerned with them, in order to their being apprehended or  
acquitted.</p>  
<pb n="543" id="vII543"/>  
<p>  
<figure entity="Uphv2556">  
<figDesc>Page 543.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> &mdash; That I am, of all men, the least able to give any conjecture  
about it, because I do not know it, having myself never seen it, nor know  
nothing of it but by report, in which there must be supposed a possibility of  
some mistake, in part or in whole; but that which I have here heard is this:  
First, That they do tell who are witches, of which some they know, and  
some they do not. Secondly, They tell who did torment such and such a  
person, though they know not the person. Thirdly, They are tormented  
themselves by the looks of persons that are present, and recovered again by  
the touching of them. Fourthly, That, if they look to them, they fall down  
tormented; but, if the persons accused look from them, they recover, or do  
not fall into that torment. Fifthly, They can tell when a person is coming  
before they see them, and what clothes they have, and some what they have  
done for several years past, which nobody else ever accused them with, nor  
do not yet think them guilty of. Sixthly, That the dead out of their graves  
do appear unto them, and tell them that they have been murdered, and  
require them to see them to be revenged on the murtherers, which they  
name to them; some of which persons are well known to die their natural  
deaths, and publicly buried in the sight of all men. Now, if these things be  
so, I thus affirm, &mdash;</p>  
<p>First, That whatsoever is done by them that is supernatural, is either  
divine or diabolical.</p>  
<p>Secondly, That nothing is, or can be, divine, but what have God's stamp  
upon it, to which he refers for trial (Isa. viii. 19, 20): &ldquo;If they speak not  
according to these, there is no light in them.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>Thirdly, And by that rule none of these actions of theirs have any warrant in God's word, but condemned wholly.</p>  
<p>First, It is utterly unlawful to inquire of the dead, or to be informed by  
them (Isa. viii. 19). It was an act of the Witch of Endor to raise the dead,  
and of a reprobate Saul to inquire of him (1 Sam. xxviii. 8, 11-14; Deut.  
xviii. 11).</p>  
<p>Secondly, It is a like evil to seek to them that have familiar spirits (Lev.  
xix. 31). It was the sin of Saul in the forementioned place (1 Sam. xxviii.  
8); and of wicked Manasses (2 Kings, xxi. 6).</p>  
<p>Thirdly, No more is it likely that their racking and tormenting should be  
done by God or good angels, but by the Devil, whose manner have ever  
been to be so employed. Witness his dealing with the poor child (Mark ix.  
17, 19, 20-22); and with the man that was possessed by him (Mark v. 2-5);  
besides what he did to Job (Job ii. 7); and all the lies that he told against  
him to the very face of God.</p>  
<p>Fourthly, The same may be rationally said of all the rest. Who should  
tell them things that they do not see, but the Devil; especially when some  
things that they tell are false and mistaken?</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Query Sixth.</hi> &mdash; These things premised, it now comes to the last and  
greatest question or query; namely, How shall it be known when the Devil  
do any of these acts of his own proper motion, without human concurrence,  
<pb n="544" id="vII544"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2557">  
<figDesc>Page 544.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
consent, or instigation, and when he doth it by the suggestion or consent of  
any person? This question, well resolved, would do our business.</p>  
<p>First, That the Devil can do acts supernatural without the furtherance of  
him by human consent or concurrence; but men or women cannot do them  
without the help of the Devil (must be granted). That granted, it follows,  
that the Devil is always the doer, but whether abetted in it by anybody is  
uncertain.</p>  
<p>Secondly, Will it be sufficient for the Devil himself to say such a man or  
woman set him a work to torment such a person by looking upon him? Is  
the Devil a competent witness in such a case?</p>  
<p>Thirdly, Or are those that are tormented by him legal witnesses to say  
that the Devil doth it by the procurement of such a person, whenas they  
know nothing about it but what comes to them from the Devil (that torments them)?</p>  
<p>Fourthly, May we believe the witches that do accuse any one because  
they say so (can the fruit be better than the tree)? If the root of all their  
knowledge be the Devil, what must their testimony be?</p>  
<p>Fifthly, Their testimony may be legal against themselves, because they  
know what themselves do, but cannot know what another doth but by information from the Devil: I mean in such cases when the person accused do  
deny it, and his conversation is blameless (Prov. xviii. 5; Prov. xix. 5).</p>  
<p>First, It is directly contrary to the use of reason, the law of nature, and  
principles of humanity, to deny it, and plead innocent, when accused of  
witchcraft, and yet, at the same time, to be acting witchcraft in the sight  
of all men, when they know their lives lie at stake by doing it. Self-interest  
teaches every one better.</p>  
<p>Secondly, It is contrary to the Devil's nature, or common practice, to  
accuse witches. They are a considerable part of his kingdom, which would  
fall, if divided against itself (Matt. xii. 26); except we think he that spake  
the words understood not what he said (which were blasphemy to think); or  
that those common principles or maxims are now changed; or that the  
Devil have changed his nature, and is now become a reformer to purge out  
witches out of the world, out of the country, and out of the churches; and is  
to be believed, though a liar and a murtherer from the beginning, and also  
though his business is going about continually, seeking whom he may  
destroy (1 Pet. v. 8); and his peculiar subject of his accusation are the  
brethren: called the accuser of the brethren.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Objection.</hi> &mdash; God do sometimes bring things to light by his providence in  
a way extraordinary.</p>  
<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> &mdash; It is granted God have so done, and brought hidden things to  
light, which, upon examination, have been proved or confessed, and so the  
way is clear for their execution; but what is that to this case, where the  
Devil is accuser and witness?</p>

EXTRACTS FROM MR. PARRIS'S CHURCH  
RECORDS.</head>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>[The following passages are taken from the records of the Salem Village Church,  
as specimens of Mr. Parris's style of narrative in that interesting document, and as  
shedding some light upon the subject of these volumes: &mdash;]</p>  
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sab:</hi> 4 Nov. [1694]. &mdash; After sermon in the afternoon, it was propounded  
to the brethren, whether the church ought not to inquire again of our dissenting brethren after the reason of their dissent. Nothing appearing from  
any against it, it was put to vote, and carried in the affirmative (by all, as  
far as I know, except one brother, Josh: Rea), that Brother Jno. Tarbell  
should, the next Lord's Day, appear and give in his reasons in public; the  
contrary being propounded, if any had aught to object against it. But no  
dissent was manifested; and so Brother Nathaniel Putnam and Deacon  
Ingersoll were desired to give this message from the church to the said  
Brother Tarbell.</p>  
<p>Sab: 11 Nov. &mdash; Before the evening blessing was pronounced, Brother Tarbell was openly called again and again; but, he not appearing, application  
was made to the abovesaid church's messengers for his answer: whereupon  
said Brother Putnam reported that the said Brother Tarbell told him he did  
not know how to come to us on a Lord's Day, but desired rather that he  
might make his appearance some week-day. Whereupon the congregation  
was dismissed with the blessing: and the church stayed, and, by a full vote,  
renewed their call of said Brother Tarbell to appear the next Lord's Day for  
the ends abovesaid; and Deacon Putnam and Brother Jonathan Putnam  
were desired to be its messengers to the said dissenting brother.</p>  
<p>Sab: 18 Nov. &mdash; The said brother came in the afternoon; and, after sermon, he was asked the reasons for his withdrawing: whereupon he produced  
a paper, which he was urged to deliver to the pastor to communicate to the  
church; but he refused it, asking who was the church's mouth. To which,  
when he was answered, &ldquo;The pastor,&rdquo; he replied, Not in this case, because  
his offence was with him. The pastor demanded whether he had offence  
against any of the church besides the pastor. He answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; So at  
length we suffered a non-member, Mr. Jos: Hutchinson, to read it. After  
<pb n="546" id="vII546"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2559">  
<figDesc>Page 546.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
which the pastor read openly before the whole congregation his overtures for  
peace and reconciliation. After which said Tarbell, seemingly (at least)  
much affected, said, that, if half so much had been said formerly, it had  
never come to this. But he added that others also were dissatisfied besides  
himself: and therefore he desired opportunity that they might come also,  
which was immediately granted; viz., the 26 instant, at two o'clock.</p>  
<p>26 Nov. &mdash; At the public meeting above appointed at the meeting-house,  
after the pastor had first sought the grace of God with us in prayer, he then  
summed up to the church and congregation (among which were several  
strangers) the occasion of our present assembling, as is hinted the last meeting. Then seeing, together with Brother Tarbell, two more of our dissenting brethren, viz., Sam: Nurse, and Thomas Wilkins (who had, to suit  
their designs, placed themselves in a seat conveniently together), the church  
immediately, to save further sending for them, voted that said Brother  
Wilkins and Brother Nurse should now, together with Brother Tarbell, give  
in their reasons of withdrawing from the church. Then the pastor applied  
himself to all these three dissenters, pressing the church's desire upon them.  
So they produced a paper, which they much opposed the coming into the  
pastor's hands, and his reading of it; but at length they yielded to it.  
Whilst the paper was reading, Brother Nurse looked upon another (which  
he said was the original): and, after it was read throughout, he said it was  
the same with what he had. Their paper was as followeth: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;The reasons why we withdraw from communion with the church of  
Salem Village, both as to hearing the word preached, and from partaking  
with them at the Lord's Table, are as followeth: &mdash;</p>  
<p>&ldquo;1. Why we attend not on public prayer and preaching the word, these  
are, (1.) The distracting and disturbing tumults and noises made by the  
persons under diabolical power and delusions, preventing sometimes our  
hearing and understanding and profiting of the word preached; we having,  
after many trials and experiences, found no redress in this case, accounted  
ourselves under a necessity to go where we might hear the word in quiet.  
(2.) The apprehensions of danger of ourselves being accused as the Devil's  
instruments to molest and afflict the persons complaining, we seeing those  
whom we had reason to esteem better than ourselves thus accused, blemished, and of their lives bereaved, foreseeing this evil, thought it our prudence to withdraw. (3.) We found so frequent and positive preaching up  
some principles and practices by Mr. Parris, referring to the dark and  
dismal mysteries of iniquity working amongst us, as was not profitable, but  
offensive. (4.) Neither could we, in conscience, join with Mr. Parris in  
many of the requests which he made in prayer, referring to the trouble then  
among us and upon us; therefore thought it our most safe and peaceable  
way to withdraw.</p>  
<p>&ldquo;2. The reasons why we hold not communion with them at the Lord's  
<pb n="547" id="vII547"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2560">  
<figDesc>Page 547.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
Table are, first, we esteem ourselves justly aggrieved and offended with  
the officer who doth administer, for the reasons following: (1.) From his  
declared and published principles, referring to our molestation from the  
invisible world, differing from the opinion of the generality of the Orthodox  
ministers of the whole country. (2.) His easy and strong faith and belief of  
the affirmations and accusations made by those they call the afflicted. (3.)  
His laying aside that grace which, above all, we are required to put on;  
namely, charity toward his neighbors, and especially towards those of his  
church, when there is no apparent reason for the contrary. (4.) His approving and practising unwarrantable and ungrounded methods for discovering  
what he was desirous to know referring to the bewitched or possessed persons, as in bringing some to others, and by and from them pretending to  
inform himself and others who were the Devil's instruments to afflict the  
sick and pained. (5.) His unsafe and unaccountable oath, given by him  
against sundry of the accused. (6.) His not rendering to the world so fair,  
if true, an account of what he wrote on examination of the afflicted. (7.)  
Sundry unsafe, if sound, points of doctrine delivered in his preaching, which  
we esteem not warrantable, if Christian. (8.) His persisting in these principles, and justifying his practices, not rendering any satisfaction to us when  
regularly desired, but rather further offending and dissatisfying ourselves.</p>  
<p rend="right">&ldquo;<hi rend="smallcaps">John Tarbell.</hi></p>  
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Tho: Wilkins.</hi></p>  
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Sam: Nurse.</hi>&rdquo;</p></q>  
<p>When the pastor had read these charges, he asked the dissenters above  
mentioned whether they were offended with none in the church besides  
himself. They replied, that they articled against none else. Then the  
officer asked them if they withdrew from communion upon account of none  
in the church besides himself. They answered, that they withdrew only  
upon my account. Then I read them my &ldquo;Meditations for Peace,&rdquo; mentioned 18 instant; viz.: &mdash;</p>  
<q><p>&ldquo;Forasmuch as it is the undoubted duty of all Christians to pursue peace  
(Ps. xxxiv. 14), even unto a reaching of it, if it be possible (Rom. xii. 18,  
19); and whereas, through the righteous, sovereign, and awful Providence  
of God, the Grand Enemy to all Christian peace has, of late, been most  
tremendously let loose in divers places hereabouts, and more especially  
amongst our sinful selves, not only to interrupt that partial peace which we  
did sometimes enjoy, but also, through his wiles and temptations and our  
weaknesses and corruptions, to make wider breaches, and raise more bitter  
animosities between too many of us, in which dark and difficult dispensation  
we have been all, or most of us, of one mind for a time, and afterwards of  
differing apprehensions, and, at last, are but in the dark, &mdash; upon serious  
thoughts of all, and after many prayers, I have been moved to present to  
you (my beloved flock) the following particulars, in way of contribution  
<pb n="548" id="vII548"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2561">  
<figDesc>Page 548.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
towards a regaining of Christian concord (if so be we are not altogether  
unappeasable, irreconcilable, and so destitute of the good spirit which is first  
pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, James iii. 17); viz.,  
(1.) In that the Lord ordered the late horrid calamity (which afterwards,  
plague-like, spread in many other places) to break out first in my family, I  
cannot but look upon as a very sore rebuke, and humbling providence, both  
to myself and mine, and desire so we may improve it. (2.) In that also in  
my family were some of both parties, viz., accusers and accused, I look also  
upon as an aggravation of the rebuke, as an addition of wormwood to the  
gall. (3.) In that means were used in my family (though totally unknown  
to me or mine, except servants, till afterwards) to raise spirits and create  
apparitions in no better than a diabolical way, I do look upon as a further  
rebuke of Divine Providence. And by all, I do humbly own this day,  
before the Lord and his people, that God has been righteously spitting in my  
face (Num. xii. 14). And I desire to lie low under all this reproach, and  
to lay my hand upon my mouth. (4.) As to the management of those  
mysteries, as far as concerns myself, I am very desirous (upon farther light)  
to own any errors I have therein fallen into, and can come to a discerning of.  
In the mean while, I do acknowledge, upon after-considerations, that, were  
the same troubles again, (which the Lord, of his rich mercy, for ever prevent),  
I should not agree with my former apprehensions in all points; as, for  
instance, (1.) I question not but God sometimes suffers the Devil (as of late)  
to afflict in the shape of not only innocent but pious persons, or so delude  
the senses of the afflicted that they strongly conceit their hurt is from such  
persons, when, indeed, it is not. (2.) The improving of one afflicted to  
inquire by, who afflicts the others, I fear may be, and has been, unlawfully  
used, to Satan's great advantage. (3.) As to my writing, it was put upon  
me by authority; and therein I have been very careful to avoid the wronging  
of any (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>). (4). As to my oath, I never meant it, nor do I know how it can  
be otherwise construed, than as vulgarly and every one understood; yea, and  
upon inquiry, it may be found so worded also. (5.) As to any passage in  
preaching or prayer, in that sore hour of distress and darkness, I always  
intended but due justice on each hand, and that not according to man, but  
God (who knows all things most perfectly), however, through weakness or  
sore exercise, I might sometimes, yea, and possibly sundry times, unadvisedly expressed myself. (6.) As to several that have confessed against themselves, they being wholly strangers to me, but yet of good account with  
better men than myself, to whom also they are well known, I do not pass so  
much as a secret condemnation upon them; but rather, seeing God has so  
amazingly lengthened out Satan's chain in this most formidable outrage, I  
much more incline to side with the opinion of those that have grounds to  
hope better of them. (7.) As to all that have unduly suffered in these matters (either in their persons or relations), through the clouds of human weakness, and Satan's wiles and sophistry, I do truly sympathize with them;  
taking it for granted that such as drew themselves clear of this great transgression,  
<pb n="549" id="vII549"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2562">  
<figDesc>Page 549.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
or that have sufficient grounds so to look upon their dear friends,  
have hereby been under those sore trials and temptations, that not an ordinary measure of true grace would be sufficient to prevent a bewraying of  
remaining corruption. (8.) I am very much in the mind, and abundantly  
persuaded, that God (for holy ends, though for what in particular is best  
known to himself) has suffered the evil angels to delude us on both hands,  
but how far on the one side or the other is much above me to say. And, if  
we cannot reconcile till we come to a full discerning of these things, I fear  
we shall never come to agreement, or, at soonest, not in this world. Therefore (9), in fine, The matter being so dark and perplexed as that there is no  
present appearance that all God's servants should be altogether of one mind,  
in all circumstances touching the same, I do most heartily, fervently, and  
humbly beseech pardon of the merciful God, through the blood of Christ, of  
all my mistakes and trespasses in so weighty a matter; and also all your  
forgiveness of every offence in this and other affairs, wherein you see or conceive I have erred and offended; professing, in the presence of the Almighty  
God, that what I have done has been, as for substance, as I apprehended was  
duty, &mdash; however through weakness, ignorance, &amp;c., I may have been mistaken; I also, through grace, promising each of you the like of me. And  
so again, I beg, entreat, and beseech you, that Satan, the devil, the roaring  
lion, the old dragon, the enemy of all righteousness, may no longer be served  
by us, by our envy and strifes, where every evil work prevails whilst these  
bear sway (Isa. iii. 14-16); but that all, from this day forward, may be  
covered with the mantle of love, and we may on all hands forgive each  
other heartily, sincerely, and thoroughly, as we do hope and pray that God,  
for Christ's sake, would forgive each of ourselves (Matt. xviii. 21 <hi rend="italics">ad finem;</hi>  
Col. iii. 12, 13). Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,  
bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering,  
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye (Eph. iv. 31, 32).  
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil-speaking be put  
away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven  
you. Amen, amen.</p>

<p>[In the record, off against (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>) as above, the following is in Mr. Parris's writing:]</p>  
<p>(<hi rend="italics">a</hi>) Added, by the desire of the council, this following paragraph; viz.,  
Nevertheless, I fear, that, in and through the throng of the many things  
written by me, in the late confusions, there has not been a due exactness  
always used; and, as I now see the inconveniency of my writing so much on  
those difficult occasions, so I would lament every error of such writings. &mdash;  
Apr. 3, 1695. Idem. S. P.</p>  
<p>[The above passage (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>) is inserted in a marginal space left for it on a page containing the record of a meeting, Nov. 26, 1694, while it is dated April 3, 1695, and

</figure>  
purports to be added &ldquo;by the desire of the council,&rdquo; which met at the last-named  
date. There are other indications, that the record of Mr. Parris's controversy with  
the dissatisfied brethren, consequent upon the proceedings in 1692, was made originally on separate sheets of paper, and then compiled, and inscribed in the church, as it there appears. There are several other entries, which refer to dates ahead.  
He probably made out his record near the close of the struggle which resulted in his  
dismission, and left it, on the pages of the book, as his history of the case. After giving his &ldquo;Meditations for Peace,&rdquo; the record goes on: &mdash;]</p>  
<p>After I had read these overtures abovesaid, I desired the brethren to declare themselves whether they remained still dissatisfied. Brother Tarbell  
answered, that they desired to consider of it, and to have a copy of what I  
had read. I replied, that then they must subscribe their reasons (above  
mentioned), for as yet they were anonymous: so at length, with no little difficulty, I purchased the subscription of their charges by my abovesaid overtures, which I gave, subscribed with my name, to them, to consider of; and  
so this meeting broke up. Notes that, during this agitation with our dissenting brethren, they entertained frequent whisperings with comers and goers  
to them and from them; particularly Dan: Andrews, and Tho: Preston from  
Mr. Israel Porter, and Jos: Hutchinson, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Nov. 30, 1694. &mdash; Brother Nurse and Brother Tarbell (bringing with them  
Joseph Putnam and Tho: Preston) towards night came to my house, where  
they found the two deacons and several other brethren; viz., Tho: Putnam,  
Jno. Putnam, Jr., Benj. Wilkins, and Ezek: Cheever, besides Lieutenant Jno.  
Walcot. And Brother Tarbell said they came to answer my paper, which  
they had now considered of, and their answer was this; viz., that they  
remained dissatisfied, and desired that the church would call a council, according to the advice we had lately from ministers.</p>  
<p>[An account has been given, p. 493, of the attempts of the &ldquo;dissatisfied brethren&rdquo;  
to procure a mutual council to decide the controversy between them and Mr. Parris.  
On the 14th of June, 1694, a letter was addressed to him, advising him to agree to the  
call of such a council, signed by John Higginson, of the First Church in Salem; James  
Allen, of the First Church in Boston; John Hale, of the church in Beverly; Samuel  
Willard, of the Old South Church in Boston; Samuel Cheever, of the church in Marblehead; and Joseph Gerrish, of the church in Wenham. Nicholas Noyes joined in  
the advice, &ldquo;with this proviso, that he be not chosen one of the council.&rdquo; Mr. Parris  
contrived to avoid following the advice. On the 10th of September, Messrs. Higginson,  
Allen, Willard, Cheever, and Gerrish again, in earnest and quite peremptory terms,  
renewed their advice in another letter to Mr. Parris. No longer venturing to resist  
their authority, he yielded, and consented to a mutual council, upon certain terms,  
one of which was, that neither of the churches whose ministers had thus forced him  
to the measure should be of the council. The following passages give the conclusion  
of the matter, as related by Mr. Parris in his record-book: &mdash;]</p>  
<p>Feb. 12 [1695]. &mdash; The church met again, as last agreed upon; and, after a  
while, our dissenting brethren, Tho: Wilkins, Sam: Nurse, and Jno. Tarbell,  
came also. After our constant way of begging the presence of God with us,  
<pb n="551" id="vII551"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2564">  
<figDesc>Page 551.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
we desired our dissenting brethren to acquaint us whether they would accept  
of our last proposals, which they desired to this day to consider of. They  
answered, that they were willing to drop the six churches from whose elders  
we had had the advice abovesaid, dated 14 June last; but they were not free  
to exclude Ipswich. This they stuck unto long, and then desired that they  
might withdraw a little to confer among themselves about it, which was  
granted. But they quickly returned, as resolved for Ipswich as before. We  
desired them to nominate the three churches they would have sent to: and,  
after much debate, they did; viz., Rowley, Salisbury, and Ipswich. Whereupon we voted, by a full consent, Rowley and Salisbury churches for a part  
of the council, and desired them to nominate a third church. But still they  
insisted on Ipswich, which we told them they were openly informed, the last  
meeting, that we had excepted against. Then they were told that we would  
immediately choose three other churches to join with the two before nominated and voted, if they saw not good to nominate any more; or else we  
would choose two other churches to join with the aforesaid two, if they  
pleased. They answered, they would be willing to that, if Ipswich might be  
one of them. Then it was asked them, if a dismission to some other Orthodox  
church, where they might better please themselves, would content them.  
Brother Tarbell answered, &ldquo;Ay, if we could find a way to remove our livings  
too.&rdquo; Then it was propounded, whether we could not unite amongst ourselves. The particular answer hereunto I remember not; but (I think) such  
hints were given by them as if it were impossible. Thus much time being  
gone, it being well towards sunset, and we concluding that it was necessary  
that we should do something ourselves, if they would not (as the elders had  
heretofore desired) accept of our joining with them, we dismissed them; and,  
by a general agreement amongst ourselves, read and voted letters to the  
churches at North Boston, Weymouth, Malden, and Rowley, for their help  
in a council.</p>  
<p>[Mr. Parris's plan of finding refuge in an <hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi> council was utterly frustrated.  
On the 1st of March, the &ldquo;reverend elders in the Bay accounted it advisable,&rdquo; as he  
expresses it in his records, that the First Church and the Old South Church in Boston  
should be added to the council. They wrote to him to that effect, and he had to comply. This brought James Allen and Samuel Willard into the council, and determined  
the character of the result, which, coming from a tribunal called by him to adjudicate  
the case, and hearing only such evidence as he laid before it, so far as it bore against  
him, was decisive and fatal. It was as follows: &mdash;]</p>  
<p>The elders and messengers of the churches &mdash; met in council at Salem  
Village, April 3, 1695, to consider and determine what is to be done for the  
composure of the present unhappy differences in that place, &mdash; after solemn  
invocation of God in Christ for his direction, do unanimously declare and  
advise as followeth: &mdash;</p>  
<p>I. We judge that, albeit in the late and the dark time of the confusions,  
wherein Satan had obtained a more than ordinary liberty to be sifting of this  
plantation, there were sundry unwarrantable and uncomfortable steps taken  
<pb n="552" id="vII552"/>  
<figure entity="Uphv2565">  
<figDesc>Page 552.</figDesc>  
</figure>  
by Mr. Samuel Parris, the pastor of the church in Salem Village, then under  
the hurrying distractions of amazing afflictions; yet the said Mr. Parris, by  
the good hand of God brought unto a better sense of things, hath so fully  
expressed it, that a Christian charity may and should receive satisfaction  
therewith.</p>  
<p>II. Inasmuch as divers Christian brethren in the church of Salem Village  
have been offended at Mr. Parris for his conduct in the time of the difficulties  
and calamities which have distressed them, we now advise them charitably  
to accept the satisfaction which he hath tendered in his Christian acknowledgments of the errors therein committed; yea, to endeavor, as far as 'tis possible, the fullest reconciliation of their minds unto communion with him, in  
the whole exercise of his ministry, and with the rest of the church (Matt. vi.  
12-14; Luke xvii. 8; James v. 16).</p>  
<p>III. Considering the extreme trials and troubles which the dissatisfied  
brethren in the church of Salem Village have undergone in the day of sore  
temptation which hath been upon them, we cannot but advise the church to  
treat them with bowels of much compassion, instead of all more critical or  
rigorous proceedings against them, for the infirmities discovered by them in  
such an heart-breaking day. And if, after a patient waiting for it, the said  
brethren cannot so far overcome the uneasiness of their spirits, in the remembrance of the disasters that have happened, as to sit under his ministry, we  
advise the church, with all tenderness, to grant them a dismission unto any  
other society of the faithful whereunto they may desire to be dismissed (Gal.  
vi. 1, 2; Ps. ciii. 13, 14; Job xix. 21).</p>  
<p>IV. Mr. Parris having, as we understand, with much fidelity and integrity  
acquitted himself in the main course of his ministry since he hath been pastor to the church in Salem Village, about his first call whereunto, we look  
upon all contestations now to be both unreasonable and unseasonable; and  
our Lord having made him a blessing unto the souls of not a few, both old  
and young, in this place, we advise that he be accordingly respected, honored,  
and supported, with all the regards that are due to a painful minister of the  
gospel (1 Thess. v. 12, 13; 1 Tim. v. 17).</p>  
<p>V. Having observed that there is in Salem Village a spirit full of contentions and animosities, too sadly verifying the blemish which hath heretofore  
lain upon them, and that some complaints brought against Mr. Parris have  
been either causeless and groundless, or unduly aggravated, we do, in the  
name and fear of the Lord, solemnly warn them to consider, whether, if they  
continue to devour one another, it will not be bitterness in the latter end;  
and beware lest the Lord be provoked thereby utterly to deprive them of  
those which they should account their precious and pleasant things, and  
abandon them to all the desolations of a people that sin away the mercies of  
the gospel (James iii. 16; Gal. v. 15; 2 Sam. ii. 26; Isa. v. 4, 5, 6; Matt.  
xxi. 43).</p>  
<p>VI. If the distempers in Salem Village should be (which God forbid!) so  
incurable, that Mr. Parris, after all, find that he cannot, with any comfort

and service, continue in his present station, his removal from thence will not  
expose him unto any hard character with us, nor, we hope, with the rest of  
the people of God among whom we live (Matt. x. 14; Acts xxii. 18).</p>  
<p>All which advice we follow with our prayers that the God of peace would  
bruise Satan under our feet. Now, the Lord of peace himself give you peace  
always by all means.</p>

<p>[The names of the lay members of the Council are marked thus, <unclear></unclear>. They were  
persons of high standing in civil life. Samuel Checkley was not (as stated [Supplement, p. 494], through an inadvertence, of which, I crust, not many such instances  
can be found in these volumes) the Rev. Mr. Checkley, but his father, Col. Samuel  
Checkley, a citizen of Boston, of much prominence at the time.</p>  
<p>The foregoing document is skilfully drawn. While kindly in its tone towards Mr.  
Parris, it is, in reality, a strong condemnation of his course, especially in Article I.,  
as also in the paragraph marked (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>), (p. 549), &ldquo;added by the desire of the Council&rdquo; to  
his &ldquo;Meditations for Peace.&rdquo; Article III. discountenances the proceedings of his  
church in its censure of &ldquo;the dissatisfied brethren,&rdquo; and requires that they should  
be recognized and treated as members in good standing. The fifth article administers  
rebuke with an equal hand to both sides, while the sixth and last recommends the  
removal of Mr. Parris, if the alienation of his opponents should prove &ldquo;incurable.&rdquo;</p>  
<p>As an authoritative condemnation of the proceedings related in this work, pronounced at the time, it is a fitting final close of the presentation of this subject.]</p>
