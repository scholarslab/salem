 <head>(Examination of Nehemiah Abbott, Jr.) </head> 
 <p>The examination of  <NAME>Nehemiah Abbot, </NAME> at a court at Salem village, <lb/> 
by John Hawthorne and Jonathan Corwin Esqrs. 
 <date value=1692-04-22>22nd April 1692 </date>. </p> 
 <p>What say you, are you guilty of witchcraft, of which you are  <orig reg="suspected">sus- <lb/> 
pected </orig>, or not? No Sir, I say before God, before whom I stand, that <lb/> 
I know nothing of witchcraft. Who is this man? Ann Putman named <lb/> 
him. -- Mary Walcot said she had seen his shape. What do you say to <lb/> 
this? I never did hurt them. Who hurt you Ann Putman? That man. <lb/> 
I never hurt her. Ann Putman said, he is upon the beam. Just such a <lb/> 
discovery of the person carried out, and she confessed; and if you <lb/> 
would find mercy of God, you must confess. -- If I should confess <lb/> 
this, I must confess what is false. Tell how far you have gone, who <lb/> 
hurts you? I do not know, I am absolutely free. As you say, God <lb/> 
knows. If you will confess the truth, we desire nothing else that you <lb/> 
may not hide you guilt, if you are guilty, and therefore confess if so. <lb/> 
I speak before God that I am clear from this accusation. What, in all <lb/> 
respects? Yes in all respects. Doth this man hurt you? Their mouths <lb/> 
were stopped. You hear several accuse you, though one cannot open <lb/> 
her mouth. I am altogether free. Charge him not unless it be he. This <lb/> 
is the man say some, and some say he is very like him. How did you <lb/> 
know his name? He did not tell me himself, but other witches told <lb/> 
me. Ann Putman said, it is the same man, and then she was taken with <lb/> 
a fit. Mary Walcot, is this the man? He is like him, I cannot say it is <lb/> 
he. Mercy Lewis said it is not the man. They all agreed, the man had <lb/> 
a bunch on his eyes. Ann Putman, in a fit, said, be you the man? ay, <lb/> 
do you say you be the man? did you put a mist before my eyes? <lb/> 
Then he was sent forth till several others were examined. When he was <lb/> 
brought in again, by reason of much people, and many in the  <orig reg="windows">win- <lb/> 
dows </orig> so that the accusers could not have a clear view of him, he was <lb/> 
 <pb n="050"> 
ordered to be abroad, and the accusers to go forth to him and view <lb/> 
him in the light, which they did, and in the presence of the  <orig reg="magistrates">magis- <lb/> 
trates </orig> and many others discoursed quietly with him, one and all <lb/> 
acquitting him, but yet said he was like that man, but he had not the <lb/>

 <p> <NAME>John Aldin </NAME> Senior, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk,  <orig reg="Mariner">Mar- <lb/> 
iner </orig>, on the  <date value=1692-05-28>28th Day of May, 1692, </date> was sent for by the  <orig reg="Magistrates">Magi- <lb/> 
strates </orig> of Salem, in the County of Essex, upon the Accusation of a <lb/> 
company of poor distracted, or possessed Creatures or Witches; <lb/> 
and being sent by Mr. Stoughton, arrived there the 31st of May, <lb/> 
and appeared at Salem-Village, before Mr. Gidney, Mr. Hathorn, <lb/> 
and Mr. Curwin. </p> 
 <p>Those Wenches being present, who plaid their jugling tricks, <lb/> 
falling down, crying out, and staring in Peoples Faces; the  <orig reg="Magistrates">Magi- <lb/> 
strates </orig> demanded of them several times, who it was of all the People <lb/> 
in the Room that hurt them? one of these Accusers pointed several <lb/> 
times at one Captain Hill, there present, but spake nothing; the <lb/> 
same Accuser had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he <lb/> 
stooped down to her Ear, then she cried out, Aldin, Aldin afflicted <lb/> 
her; one of the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen Aldin, <lb/> 
she answered no, he asked her how she knew it was Aldin? She <lb/> 
said, the Man told her so. </p> 
 <p>Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring <lb/> 
was made; and the same Accuser cried out, &ldquo;there stands Aldin, a <lb/> 
bold fellow with his Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and <lb/> 
Shot to the Indians and French, and lies with the Indian Squaes, <lb/> 
and has Indian Papooses.&rdquo; Then was Aldin committed to the Marshal's <lb/> 
Custody, and his Sword taken from him; for they said he afflicted <lb/> 
them with his Sword. After some hours Aldin was sent for to the <lb/> 
Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required <lb/> 
Aldin to stand upon a Chair, to the open view of all the People. </p> 
 <pb n="053"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>The Accusers cried out that Aldin did pinch them, then, when <lb/> 
he stood upon the Chair, in the sight of all the People, a good way <lb/> 
distant from them, one of the Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold <lb/> 
open Aldin's hands, that he might not pinch those Creatures. Aldin <lb/> 
asked them why they should think that he should come to that <lb/> 
Village to afflict those persons that he never knew or saw before? <lb/> 
Mr. Gidney bid Aldin confess, and give glory to God; Aldin said <lb/> 
he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped he should never <lb/> 
gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they <lb/> 
ever suspected him to be such a person, and challenged any one, <lb/> 
that could bring in any thing upon their own knowledge, that might <lb/> 
give suspicion of his being such an one. Mr. Gidney said he had <lb/> 
known Aldin many Years, and had been at Sea with him, and  <orig reg="always">al- <lb/> 
ways </orig> look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did see cause <lb/> 
to alter his judgment: Aldin answered, he was sorry for that, but <lb/> 
he hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he would recall <lb/> 
that judgment again, and added that he hoped that he should with <lb/> 
Job maintain his Integrity till he died. They bid Aldin look upon <lb/> 
the Accusers, which he did, and then they fell down. Aldin asked <lb/> 
Mr. Gidney, what Reason there could be given, why Aldin's looking <lb/> 
upon  <hi rend="italics">him </hi> did not strike  <hi rend="italics">him </hi> down as well; but no reason was given <lb/> 
that I heard. But the Accusers were brought to Aldin to touch them, <lb/> 
and this touch they said made them well. Aldin began to speak of <lb/> 
the Providence of God in suffering these Creatures to accuse  <orig reg="Innocent">Inno- <lb/> 
cent </orig> persons. Mr. Noyes asked Aldin why he would offer to speak of <lb/> 
the Providence of God. God by his Providence (said Mr. Noyes) <lb/> 
governs the World, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with  <orig reg="Discourse">Dis- <lb/> 
course </orig>, and stopt Aldin's mouth, as to that. Aldin told Mr. Gidney, <lb/> 
that he could assure him that there was a lying Spirit in them, for I <lb/> 
can assure you that there is not a word of truth in all these say of <lb/> 
me. But Aldin was again committed to the Marshal, and his Mittimus <lb/> 
written, which was as follows. </p>

 <p>As soon as she came near all fell into fits <lb/> 
Bridget Byshop, You are now brought before Authority to Give acco. <lb/> 
of what witchcrafts you are conversant in </p> 
 <p>I take all this people (turning her head &amp; eyes about) to witness <lb/> 
that I am clear. </p> 
 <p>Hath this woman hurt you speaking to the afflicted. </p> 
 <p>Eliz: Hubbard Ann Putman, Abigail Williams &amp; Mercy Lewes <lb/> 
affirmed she had hurt them. </p> 
 <p>You are here accused by 4.or.5. for hurting them, what do you <lb/> 
say to it, </p> 
 <p>I never saw these persons before, nor I never was in this place <lb/> 
before. </p> 
 <p>Mary Walcot said that her brother Jonathan stroke her appearance <lb/> 
&amp; she saw that he had tore her coat in striking, &amp; she heard it tare. </p> 
 <p>Upon some search in the Court, a rent that seems to answere <lb/> 
what was alledged was found. </p> 
 <p>They say you bewitcht your first husband to death. </p> 
 <p>If it please your worship I know nothing of it. </p> 
 <p>She shake her head &amp; the afflicted were tortured. </p> 
 <p>The like again upon the motion of her head. </p> 
 <p>Sam: Braybrook affirmed that she told him to day that she had <lb/> 
been accounted a Witch these 10 years, but she was no Witch, the <lb/> 
Devil cannot hurt her. </p> 
 <pb n="084"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>I am no witch </p> 
 <p>Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you <lb/> 
have gone? Have you not to do with familiar Spirits? </p> 
 <p>I have no familiarity with the devil. </p> 
 <p>How is it then, that your appearance doth hurt these? </p> 
 <p>I am innocent. </p> 
 <p>Why you seem to act witchcraft before us, by the motion of your <lb/> 
body, which seems to have influence upon the afflicted. </p> 
 <p>I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a Witch. I know not what <lb/> 
a Witch is </p> 
 <p>How do you know then that you are not a witch </p> 
 <p>I do not know what you say. </p> 
 <p>How can you know, you are no Witch, &amp; yet not know what a <lb/> 
Witch is. </p> 
 <p>I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it. </p> 
 <p>You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are  <orig reg="permitted">per- <lb/> 
mitted </orig>. </p> 
 <p>I am innocent of a witch. </p> 
 <p>What do you say of those murders you are charged with? </p> 
 <p>I hope, I am not guilty of Murder </p> 
 <p>Then she turned up her eyes, the eyes of the afflicted were <lb/> 
turned up </p> 
 <p>It may be you do not know, that any have confessed to day, who <lb/> 
have been examined before you, that they are Witches. </p> 
 <p>No. I know nothing of it. </p> 
 <p>John Hutchinson &amp; John Lewis in open Court affirmed that they <lb/>

 <head>(The Rev. John Hale et al. v. Bridget Bishop) </head> 
 <p> <NAME>John Hale </NAME> of Beverly aged about 56 yeares [torn] &amp; saith that <lb/> 
about 5 or 6 years ago e Christian the wife of John Trask (living in <lb/> 
Salem bounds bordering on the abovesaid Beverly) beeing in full <lb/> 
comunion in o'r Church came to me to [de] sier that Goodwife  <orig reg="Bishop">Bish- <lb/> 
op </orig> her Neighb'r wife of Edw: Bishop Jun'r might not be permitted <lb/> 
to receive the Lords Supper in our church till she had given her the <lb/> 
said Trask satisfaction for some offences that were against her.viz  <orig reg="because">be- <lb/> 
cause </orig> the said Bishop did entertaine people in her house at  <orig reg="unseasonable">unseason- <lb/> 
able </orig> houres in the night to keep drinking and playing at shovel-board <lb/> 
whereby discord did arise in other families &amp; young people were in <lb/> 
danger to bee corrupted &amp; that the s'd Trask knew these things  <lb/> 
&amp; had once gon into the house &amp; fynding some at shovel-board had <lb/> 
taken the peices thay played with &amp; thrown them into the fyre  <lb/> 
&amp; had reprooved the said Bishop for promoting such disorders, But  <orig reg="received">re- <lb/> 
ceived </orig> no satisfaction from her about it. </p> 
 <p>I gave s'd Christian Trask direction how to proceed farther in <lb/> 
this matter if it were clearly prooved And indeed by the information <lb/> 
I have had otherwise I doe fear that if a stop had not been putt to <lb/> 
those disorders s'd Edw. Bishop's house would have been a house of <lb/> 
great prophainness &amp; iniquity. </p> 
 <p>But as to Christian Trask the next news I heard of her was that <lb/> 
she was distracted &amp; asking her husband Trask when she was so taken <lb/> 
[he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came <lb/> 
from] my house when shee complained against Goody Bishop. </p> 
 <pb n="096"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by <lb/> 
fasting &amp; prayer &amp; the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd [Trask] <lb/> 
to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her] distraction <lb/> 
(&amp; took it then to bee only distraction, yet fearing sometimes <lb/> 
somw't worse) but since I have seen the fitts of those bewitched at <lb/> 
Salem Village I call to mind some of hers to be much like some of <lb/> 
theirs. </p> 
 <p>The said Trask when recovered as I understood it did manifest <lb/> 
strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd Bishop's <lb/> 
wife &amp; showed so much aversness from having any conversation that <lb/> 
I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd Goody Bishop at that <lb/> 
time for wee have since [torn] At length s'd Christian Trask [was] <lb/> 
agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the forenoon at the  <orig reg="publ">pub- <lb/> 
l </orig>[i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance &amp; so continued sometimes <lb/> 
better sometimes worse unto her death, manifesting that shee under <lb/> 
temptation to kill her selfe or somebody else. </p> 
 <p>I enquired of Marg'rt Ring who kept at or nigh the house, what <lb/> 
shee had observed of s'd Trask before this last distraction shee told <lb/> 
[mee.] Goody Trask was much given to reading &amp; search the  <orig reg="prophecys">pro- <lb/> 
phecys </orig> of scrip[ture]. </p> 
 <p>The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house <lb/> 
she[e] came home &amp; said shee had been w'th Goody Bishop &amp; that <lb/> 
they two were now friend or to that effect. </p> 
 <p>I was oft praying w'th &amp; councelling of Goody Trask before her <lb/> 
death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed <lb/> 
more rationall &amp; earnestly desired Edw: Bishop might be sent for <lb/> 
that shee might make friends with him, I asked her if shee had <lb/> 
wronged Edw. Bishop shee said not that shee knew of unless it were <lb/> 
in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th them <lb/> 
&amp; throwing them into the fyre &amp; if she did evill in it she was very <lb/> 
sorry for it &amp; desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her. <lb/> 
this was the very day before she dyed, or a few days before. </p> 
 <p>Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in <lb/> 
those intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly desired prayers <lb/> 
&amp; the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on her <lb/> 
behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe &amp; I judge was <lb/> 
her owne hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand. </p> 
 <p>As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice <lb/> 
of her wind pipe cutt out. &amp; another wound above that threww the <lb/> 
 <pb n="097"> 
windpipe &amp; Gullet &amp; the veine they call jugular. So that I then judge <lb/> 
&amp; still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th so short a pair of <lb/>

 <p>After most humble and hearty thanks presented to your Honors <lb/> 
for the great care and pains you have already taken for us, for which <lb/> 
we are never able to make you recompense (and we believe you do <lb/>

Lord God of Israel, whose cause and interest you have espoused, <lb/> 
and we trust this shall add to your crown of glory in the day of the <lb/> 
Lord Jesus); and we, beholding continually the tremendous works of <lb/> 
divine providence -- not only every day but every hour -- thought <lb/> 
it our duty to inform your Honors of what we conceive you have <lb/> 
not heard, which are high and dreadful: of a wheel within a wheel, <lb/> 
at which our ears do tingle. </p>

 <p>It was asked  <NAME>Sarah Carrier </NAME> by the Magistrates or Justices John <lb/> 
Hawthorne Esq; and others: How long hast thou been a witch? A. <lb/> 
Ever since I was six years old. Q. How old are you now? A. Near <lb/> 
eight years old, brother Richard says, I shall be eight years old in <lb/> 
November next. Q. Who made you a witch? A. My mother, she <lb/> 
made me set my hand to a book. Q. How did you set your hand to <lb/> 
it? A. I touched it with my fingers and the book was red, the paper <lb/> 
 <pb n="202"> 
of it was white. She said she never had seen the black man; the place <lb/> 
where she did it was in Andrew Foster's pasture and Elizabeth  <orig reg="Johnson">John- <lb/> 
son </orig> junr. was there. Being asked who was there beside, she answered <lb/> 
her Aunt Toothaker and her cousin. Being asked when it was, she <lb/> 
said, when she was baptized. Q. What did they promise to give you? <lb/> 
A. A black dog. Q. Did the dog ever come to you? A. No. Q. But <lb/> 
you said you saw a cat once. What did that say to you? A. It said <lb/> 
it would tear me in pieces if I would not set my hand to the book. <lb/> 
She said her mother baptized her, and the devil or black man was <lb/> 
not there, as she saw, and her mother said when she baptized her, <lb/> 
thou are mine for ever and ever and amen. Q. How did you afflict <lb/> 
folks? A. I pinched them, and she said she had no puppets, but <lb/> 
she went to them that she afflicted. Being asked whether she went in <lb/> 
her body or her spirit, she said in her spirit. She said her mother <lb/> 
carried her thither to afflict. Q. How did your mother carry you <lb/> 
when she was in prison? A. She came like a black cat. Q. How did <lb/> 
you know that it was your mother? A. The cat told me so that she <lb/> 
was my mother. She said she afflicted Phelp's child last saturday, <lb/> 
and Elizabeth Johnson joined with her to do it. She had a wooden <lb/> 
spear, about as long as her finger, of Elizabeth Johnson, and she had <lb/> 
it of the devil. She would not own that she had ever been at the <lb/> 
witch meeting at the village. This is the substance. </p>

 <head>(Nathaniel Cary's Account of his Wife's Examination) </head> 
 <p>I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused of  <orig reg="Witchcraft">Witch- <lb/> 
craft </orig>, being much disturbed at it, by advice, we went to  <orig reg="Salem-Village">Salem- <lb/> 
Village </orig>, to see if the afflicted did know her; we arrived there, 24 <lb/> 
May, it happened to be a day appointed for Examination;  <orig reg="accordingly">accord- <lb/> 
ingly </orig> soon after our arrival, Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin, etc., went <lb/> 
to the Meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that Work, <lb/> 
the Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care to get a <lb/> 
convenient place, I observed, that the afflicted were two Girls of <lb/> 
about Ten Years old, and about two or three other, of about  <orig reg="eighteen">eight- <lb/> 
een </orig>, one of the Girls talked most, and could discern more than the <lb/> 
rest. The Prisoners were called in one by one, and as they came in <lb/> 
were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was placed about 7 or 8 foot <lb/> 
from the Justices, and the Accusers between the Justices and them; <lb/> 
the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before the Justices, with an <lb/> 
 <pb n="208"> 
Officer appointed to hold each hand, least they should therewith <lb/> 
afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be constantly on the  <orig reg="Justices">Jus- <lb/> 
tices </orig>; for if they look'd on the afflicted, they would either fall into <lb/> 
their Fits, or cry out of being hurt by them; after Examination of <lb/> 
the Prisoners, who it was afflicted these Girls, etc., they were put <lb/> 
upon saying the Lords Prayer, as a tryal of their guilt; after the <lb/> 
afflicted seem'd to be out of their Fits, they would look steadfastly <lb/> 
on some one person, and frequently not speak; and then the Justices <lb/> 
said they were struck dumb, and after a little time would speak again; <lb/> 
then the Justices said to the Accusers, &ldquo;which of you will go and <lb/> 
touch the Prisoner at the Bar?&rdquo; then the most couragious would  <orig reg="adventure">ad- <lb/> 
venture </orig>, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall <lb/> 
down as in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up <lb/> 
and carried to the Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon <lb/> 
as they were touched by the accused, the Justices would say, they are <lb/> 
well, before I could discern any alteration; by which I observed that <lb/> 
the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus far I was only as <lb/> 
a Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but no notice <lb/> 
taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her <lb/> 
and asked her name. </p> 
 <p>But I having an opportunity to Discourse Mr. Hale (with whom <lb/> 
I had formerly acquaintance) I took his advice, what I had best to <lb/> 
do, and desired of him that I might have an opportunity to speak <lb/> 
with her that accused my Wife; which he promised should be, I <lb/> 
acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him. </p> 
 <p>Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over, <lb/> 
and told me I had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser, <lb/> 
 <hi rend="italics">viz </hi>. Abigail Williams, a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old; but that we could <lb/> 
not be in private at Mr. Parris's House, as he had promised me; we <lb/> 
went therefore into the Alehouse, where an Indian Man attended us, <lb/> 
who it seems was one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, <lb/> 
he shewed several Scars, that seemed as if they had been long there, <lb/> 
and shewed them as done by Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his <lb/> 
Wife, who also was a Slave, was imprison'd for Witchcraft. And now <lb/> 
instead of one Accuser, they all came in, who began to tumble down <lb/> 
like Swine, and then three Women were called in to attend them. <lb/> 
We in the Room were all at a stand, to see who they would cry <lb/> 
out of; but in a short time they cried out, Cary; and immediately <lb/> 
 <pb n="209"> 
after a Warrant was sent from the Justices to bring my Wife before <lb/> 
them, who were sitting in a Chamber near by, waiting for this. </p> 
 <p>Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two <lb/> 
Girls; my Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any  <orig reg="knowledge">knowl- <lb/> 
edge </orig> of them before that day; she was forced to stand with her <lb/> 
Arms stretched out. I did request that I might hold one of her <lb/> 
hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me to wipe the Tears <lb/> 
from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she <lb/> 
desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she should faint. </p> 
 <p>Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment <lb/> 
those persons, and she should have strength enough to stand. I <lb/> 
speaking something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded <lb/> 
me to be silent, or else I should be turned out of the Room. The <lb/> 
Indian before mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her <lb/> 
Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the Justices) fell <lb/> 
down and tumbled about like a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices <lb/> 
asked the Girls, who afflicted the Indian? they answered she ( <orig reg="meaning">mean- <lb/> 
ing </orig> my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices ordered her to touch <lb/> 
him, in order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way, <lb/> 
least instead of curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on <lb/> 
him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took <lb/> 
hold on her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous <lb/> 
manner; then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and <lb/> 
the cure was quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their <lb/> 
Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty Speech (That God would take <lb/> 
vengeance on them, and desired that God would deliver us out of the <lb/> 
hands of unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with <lb/> 
difficulty and charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it; <lb/> 
if there had, could have taken but little rest that Night. She was <lb/> 
committed to Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to <lb/> 
remove her to Cambridge Prison, which is in our County of  <orig reg="Middlesex">Middle- <lb/> 
sex </orig>. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor put <lb/> 
Irons on her legs (having received such a command) the weight of <lb/> 
them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions, <lb/> 
soon brought her into Convulsion Fits, so that I thought she would <lb/> 
have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken <lb/> 
off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her Life, <lb/> 
so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem <lb/> 
 <pb n="210"> 
coming on, I went thither, to see how things were there managed; <lb/> 
and finding that the Spectre-Evidence was there received, together <lb/> 
with Idle, if not malicious Stories, against Peoples Lives, I did easily <lb/> 
perceive which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that <lb/> 
served for one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her <lb/> 
danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she <lb/> 
would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal <lb/> 
in our own County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for <lb/> 
it, and were put in hopes of it; but I soon saw so much, that I  <orig reg="understood">under- <lb/> 
stood </orig> thereby it was not intended, which put me upon consulting <lb/> 
the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of God was  <orig reg="effected">ef- <lb/> 
fected </orig>, and she got to Road Island, but soon found her self not safe <lb/> 
when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she <lb/> 
went to New-York, along with some others that had escaped their <lb/> 
cruel hands; where we found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, <lb/> 
Esq; Governour, who was very courteous to us. After this some of <lb/> 
my Goods were seized in a Friends hands, with whom I had left them, <lb/> 
and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a <lb/> 
day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners, <lb/> 
and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution, <lb/> 
no sober Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; <lb/> 
which is the more, considering what a People for Religion, I mean <lb/> 
the profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of <lb/> 
them Church-Members, and most of them unspotted in their  <orig reg="Conversation">Con- <lb/> 
versation </orig>, till their Adversary the Devil took up this Method for <lb/> 
accusing them. </p>

 <p>The Last Night my Daughter Ann was grievously Tormented by <lb/> 
Witches, Threatning that she should be Pressed to Death, before Giles <lb/> 
Cory. But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a <lb/> 
little Respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man <lb/> 
in a Winding Sheet; who told her that Giles Cory had Murdered him, <lb/> 
by Pressing him to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there <lb/> 
appeared unto him, and Covenented with him, and promised him, <lb/> 
He should not be Hanged. The Apparition said, God Hardened his <lb/> 
Heart, that he should not hearken to the Advice of the Court, and so <lb/> 
Dy an easy Death; because as it said, &ldquo;It must be done to him as he <lb/> 
has done to me.&rdquo; The Apparition also said, That Giles Cory was <lb/> 
Carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury had found the <lb/> 
Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing was done <lb/> 
before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange to us; that <lb/> 
no body should Remember these things, all the while that Giles <lb/> 
Cory was in Prison, and so often before the Court. For all people <lb/> 
now Remember very well, (and the Records of the Court also  <orig reg="mention">men- <lb/>

in his House, that was almost a Natural Fool: which Man Dy'd <lb/> 
suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him, among whom was <lb/> 
Dr. Zorobbabel Endicot; who found the man bruised to Death, and <lb/> 
having clodders of Blood about his Heart. The Jury, whereof  <orig reg="several">sev- <lb/>

 <p>Mr Hathorne. </p> 
 <p>You are now in the hands of Authority tell me now <lb/> 
why you hurt these persons </p> 
 <p>Martha Kory. </p> 
 <p>I do not. </p> 
 <p>who doth? </p> 
 <p>Pray give me leave to goe to prayer </p> 
 <p>This request was made sundry times </p> 
 <p>We do not send for you to go to prayer But tell me <lb/> 
why you hurt these? </p> 
 <p>I am an innocent person: I never had to do with </p> 
 <p>Witchcraft since I was born. I am a Gospel Woman </p> 
 <p>Do not you see these complain of you </p> 
 <p>The Lord open the eyes of the Magistrates &amp; Ministers: <lb/> 
the Lord show his power to discover the guilty. </p> 
 <p>Tell us who hurts these children. </p> 
 <p>I do not know. </p> 
 <p>If you be guilty of this fact do you think you can <lb/> 
hide it. </p> 
 <p>The Lord knows --  </p> 
 <p>Well tell us w't you know of this matter </p> 
 <p>Why I am a Gosple-woman, &amp; do you think I can have <lb/> 
to do with witchcraft too </p> 
 <p>How could you tell then that the Child was bid to <lb/> 
observe what cloths you wore when some came to <lb/> 
speak w'th you. </p> 
 <pb n="249"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>Cheevers. </p> 
 <p>Interrupted her &amp; bid her not begin with a lye  <lb/> 
&amp; so Edw'd Putman declared the matter </p> 
 <p>Mr Hath: </p> 
 <p>Who told you that </p> 
 <p>K. </p> 
 <p>He said the child said </p> 
 <p>Cheev: </p> 
 <p>you speak falsly </p> 
 <p>Then Edw: Putman read again </p> 
 <p>Mr H. </p> 
 <p>Why did you ask if the child told w't cloths you wore </p> 
 <p>My husband told me the others told </p> 
 <p>Who told you about the cloaths? Why did you ask <lb/> 
that question. </p> 
 <p>Because I heard the children told w't cloaths the <lb/> 
other wore </p> 
 <p>Goodm: Kory did you tell her </p> 
 <p>The old man denyed that he told her so. </p> 
 <p>Did you not say your husband told you so </p> 
 <p>K. </p> 
 <p> --  </p> 
 <p>H. </p> 
 <p>Who hurtes these children now look upon them. </p> 
 <p>K. </p> 
 <p>I cannot help it </p> 
 <p>H. </p> 
 <p>Did you not say you would tell the truth why you <lb/> 
askt that question: how come you to the knowledge --  </p> 
 <p>I did but ask </p> 
 <p>You dare thus to lye in all this assembly You are now <lb/> 
before Authority. I expect the truth, you promised it, <lb/> 
Speak now &amp; tell#[what cloths] who told you what <lb/> 
cloths </p> 
 <p>K. </p> 
 <p>No body </p> 
 <p>H. </p> 
 <p>How came you to know that the children would be <lb/> 
examined what cloth you wore </p> 
 <p>Because I thought the child was wiser, than any body <lb/> 
if she knew </p> 
 <p>Give an answer you said your husband told you </p> 
 <p>He told me the children said I afflicted them </p> 
 <p>How do you know w't they came for, answer me this <lb/> 
truly, </p> 
 <p># </p> 
 <p>will you say how you came to know what they came <lb/> 
for </p> 
 <p>I had heard speech that the children said I #[afflicted <lb/> 
them] troubled them &amp; I thought that they might <lb/> 
come to examine </p> 
 <pb n="250"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>But how did you know it </p> 
 <p>I thought they did </p> 
 <p>Did not you say you would tell the truth, who told <lb/> 
you w't they came for </p> 
 <p>No body </p> 
 <p>How did you know </p> 
 <p>I did think so </p> 
 <p>But you said you knew so </p> 
 <p>Child: <lb/> 
H Q </p> 
 <p>There is a man whispering in her ear, </p> 
 <p>What did he say to you. </p> 
 <p>We must not beleive all that these distracted children <lb/> 
say </p> 
 <p>Cannot #[he tell] you tell what that man whispered </p> 
 <p>I saw no body </p> 
 <p>But did not you hear </p> 
 <p>No, here was Extream agony of all the afflicted </p> 
 <p>If you expect mercy of God, you must look for it in <lb/> 
Gods way by confession </p> 
 <p>Do you think to find mercy by aggravating your sins </p> 
 <p>A true thing </p> 
 <p>Look for it then in Gods way </p> 
 <p># </p> 
 <p>So I do </p> 
 <p>Give glory to God &amp; confess then </p> 
 <p>But I cannot confess </p> 
 <p>Do not you see how these afflicted do charge you </p> 
 <p>We must not beleive distracted persons </p> 
 <p>Who do you improve to hurt them </p> 
 <p>I improved none </p> 
 <p>Did not you say our eyes were blinded you would <lb/> 
open them </p> 
 <p>Yes to accuse the innocent </p> 
 <p>Then Crossly gave in evidence </p> 
 <p>Why cannot the girl stand before you </p> 
 <p>I do not know. </p> 
 <p>What did you mean by that </p> 
 <p>I saw them fall down </p> 
 <p>It seems to be an insulting speech as if they could <lb/> 
not stand before you. </p> 
 <pb n="251"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>They cannot stand before others. </p> 
 <p>But you said they cannot stand before you </p> 
 <p>Tell me what was that turning upon the Spit by you </p> 
 <p>You beleive the Children that are distracted I saw no <lb/> 
spit </p> 
 <p>Here are more than two that accuse you for witchcraft </p> 
 <p>What do you say </p> 
 <p>I am innocent </p> 
 <p>Then mr Hathorn read farther of Croslys evidence </p> 
 <p>What did you mean by that the Devil could not stand <lb/> 
before you </p> 
 <p>She denyed it </p> 
 <p>3. or 4. Sober witnesses confirm'd it. </p> 
 <p>What can I do many rise up against me </p> 
 <p>Why confess. </p> 
 <p>So I would if I were guilty </p> 
 <p>Here are sober persons what do you say to them </p> 
 <p>You are a Gosple woman, will you lye </p> 
 <p>Abigail cryed out next Sab: is sacrament day, but she <lb/> 
shall not come there </p> 
 <p>Kory </p> 
 <p>I do not care </p> 
 <p>You charge these children with distraction: it is a note <lb/> 
of distraction when persons vary in a minute, but <lb/> 
these fix upon you, this is not the manner of  <orig reg="distraction">dis- <lb/> 
traction </orig> --  </p> 
 <p>When all are against me w't can I help it </p> 
 <p>Now tell me the truth will you, why did you say that <lb/> 
the Magistrates &amp; Ministers eyes are blinded you would <lb/> 
open them </p> 
 <p>She laught &amp; denyed it. </p> 
 <p> <hi rend="underline">Now tell </hi> us how we shall know </p> 
 <p>Who doth hurt these if you do not </p> 
 <p>Can an innocent person be guilty </p> 
 <p>Do you deny these words </p> 
 <p>Yes </p> 
 <p>Tell us who hurts these: We came to be a Terror to <lb/> 
evil doers </p> 
 <p>You say you would open our eyes we are blind </p> 
 <p>If you say I am a Witch </p> 
 <pb n="252"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>You said you would show us </p> 
 <p>She denyed it. </p> 
 <p>Why do you not now show us </p> 
 <p>I cannot tell: I do not know </p> 
 <p>What did you strike the maid at Mr Tho: Putmans with </p> 
 <p>I never struck her in my life </p> 
 <p>Here are two that see you strike her with an iron rod. </p> 
 <p>I had no hand in it </p> 
 <p>Who had </p> 
 <p>Do you beleive these children are bewitcht </p> 
 <p>They may for ought I know I have no hand in it. </p> 
 <p>You say you are no Witch, may be you mean you <lb/> 
never Covenanted with the Devil. Did you never deal <lb/> 
w'th any familiar </p> 
 <p>No never </p> 
 <p>What bird was that the children spoke of </p> 
 <p>Then Witnesses, spoke </p> 
 <p>What bird was it. </p> 
 <p>I know no bird. </p> 
 <p>It may be: you have engaged you will not confess. but <lb/> 
God knows. </p> 
 <p>So he doth </p> 
 <p>Do you beleive you shall go unpunished </p> 
 <p>I have nothing to do w'th withcraft </p> 
 <p>Why was you not willing your husband should come <lb/> 
to the former Session here </p> 
 <p>But he came for all </p> 
 <p>Did not you take the Saddle off </p> 
 <p>I did not know what it was for </p> 
 <p>Did you not know w't it was for </p> 
 <p>I did not know that it would be to any benefit <lb/> 
[illegible] </p> 
 <p>Some body said that she would not have them help to <lb/> 
find out witches. </p> 
 <p>Did you not say you would open our eyes why do <lb/> 
you not </p> 
 <p>I never thought of a Witch </p> 
 <p>Is it a laughing matter to see these afflicted persons </p> 
 <p>She denyed it </p> 
 <pb n="253"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>Severall prove it </p> 
 <p>Ye are all against me &amp; I cannot help it </p> 
 <p>Do not you beleive there are Witches in the Countrey </p> 
 <p>I do not know that there is any </p> 
 <p>Do not you know that Tituba Confessed it </p> 
 <p>I did  <hi rend="underline">not hear </hi> her speak </p> 
 <p>I find you will own nothing without severall witnesses <lb/> 
&amp; yet you will deny for all </p> 
 <p>It was noted w'n she bit her lip severall of the  <orig reg="afflicted">afflic- <lb/> 
ted </orig> were bitten </p> 
 <p>When she was urged upon it that she bit her lip saith <lb/> 
she what harm is there in it. </p> 
 <p>Mr. Noyes. </p> 
 <p>I beleive it is apparent she practiseth Witchcraft in <lb/> 
the congregation there is no need of images </p> 
 <p>What do you say to all these thing that are apparent </p> 
 <p>If you will all go hang me how can I help it. </p> 
 <p>Were you to serve the Devil ten years tell how many </p> 
 <p>She laught </p> 
 <p>The Children cryed there was a yellow bird with her </p> 
 <p>When Mr Hathorn askt her about it she laught </p> 
 <p>When her hands were at liberty the afflicted persons <lb/> 
were pincht </p> 
 <p>Why do not you tell how the Devil comes in your <lb/> 
shape &amp; hurts these; you said you would </p> 
 <p>How can I know how </p> 
 <p>Why did you say you would show us </p> 
 <p>She laught again </p> 
 <p>What book is that you would have these children <lb/> 
write in </p> 
 <p>What book: were should I have a book I showed them <lb/> 
none, nor have none nor brought none. </p> 
 <p>The afflicted cryed out there was a man whispering in <lb/> 
her ears. </p> 
 <p>What book did you carry to Mary Walcott </p> 
 <p>I carryed none: if the Devil appears in my shape </p> 
 <p>Then Needham Said that Parker some time agoe <lb/> 
thought this woman was a Witch </p>

told her that we would goe and talke with goode Corie shee came <lb/> 
and blinded her but told her that her name was Corie and that shee <lb/> 
should see her no more before it was night because she should not <lb/>

afflicted person that did complain of her that was the occasion of <lb/> 
our coming to her. she presently replied but does shee tell you what <lb/> 
cloathes I have on we made her no answer to this at her first asking <lb/> 
where upon shee asked us again with very great eagernes but does <lb/> 
she tell you what cloathes I have on at which questions with that <lb/> 
eagernes of mind. with which shee did aske made us to thinke of <lb/> 
what An Putnum had told us before wee went to her. #[to which] <lb/>

 <p>we had a great deal of talke with her about the complaint that was <lb/> 
of her and how greatly the name of God and religion and thee <lb/>

of people that they might not say thus of her shee told us that shee did <lb/> 
not thinke that they were accused for shee said if they were wee <lb/> 
could not blame the devill for making witches of them for they were <lb/> 
idle sloathfull persons and minded nothing that was good. but we <lb/> 
had no reason to thinke so of her for shee had made a profession of <lb/> 
christ and rejoyced to go and hear the word of god and the like. <lb/> 
but we told her it was not her making an out ward profession that <lb/> 
would clear her from being a witch for it had often been so in the <lb/>

 <p>At a Court held at Salem village  <date value=1692-04-22>22. Apr.  <hi rend="italics">1692 </hi> </date> </p> 
 <p>By the Hon. John Hathorne &amp; Jonathan Corwin. </p> 
 <p>At the bringing in of the the accused severall fell into fits. </p> 
 <p>Doth this woman hurt you? </p> 
 <p>Many mouths were stopt, &amp; several other fits seized them </p> 
 <p>Abig: Williams said it was Goody Eastie, &amp; she had hurt her, the <lb/> 
like said Mary Walcot, &amp; Ann Putman, John indian said her saw her <lb/> 
with Goody Hobbs. </p> 
 <p>What do you say, are you guilty? </p> 
 <p>I can say before Christ Jesus, I am free. </p> 
 <p>You see these accuse you. </p> 
 <p>There is a God --  </p> 
 <p>Hath she brought the book to you? </p> 
 <p>Their mouths were stopt. </p> 
 <p>What have you done to these children? </p> 
 <p>I know nothing. </p> 
 <p>How can you say you know nothing, when you see these  <orig reg="tormented">tor- <lb/> 
mented </orig>, &amp; accuse you that you know nothing? </p> 
 <p>Would you have me accuse my self? </p> 
 <p>Yes if you be guilty. </p> 
 <p>How far have you complyed w'th Satan whereby he takes this <lb/> 
advantage ag't you? </p> 
 <pb n="289"> 
 <p> 
 </p> 
 <p>Sir, I never complyed but prayed against him all my dayes, I <lb/> 
have no complyance with Satan, in this. What would you have <lb/> 
me do? </p> 
 <p>Confess if you be guilty. </p> 
 <p>I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this sin. </p> 
 <p>Of what sin? </p> 
 <p>Of witchcraft. </p> 
 <p>Are you certain this is the woman? </p> 
 <p>Never a one could speak for fits. </p> 
 <p>By and by Ann Putman said that was the woman, it was like her, <lb/> 
&amp; she told me her name; </p> 
 <p>It is marvailous to me that #[she] you should sometimes think <lb/> 
they are bewitcht, &amp; sometimes not, when severall confess that they <lb/> 
have been guilty of bewitching them. </p> 
 <p>Well Sir would you have me confess that that I never knew? </p> 
 <p>Her hands were clincht together, &amp; then the hands of Mercy <lb/> 
Lewis was clincht </p> 
 <p>Look now you hands are open, her hands are open. </p> 
 <p>Is this the woman? </p> 
 <p>They made signes but could not speak, but Ann Putman  <orig reg="afterwards">after- <lb/> 
wards </orig> Betty Hubbard cryed out Oh. Goody Easty, Goody Easty you <lb/> 
are the woman, you are the woman </p> 
 <p>Put up her head, for while her head is bowed the necks of these <lb/> 
are broken. </p> 
 <p>What do you say to this? </p> 
 <p>Why God will know. </p> 
 <p>Nay God knows now. </p> 
 <p>I know he dos. </p> 
 <p>What did you think of the actions of others before your sisters <lb/> 
came out, did you think it was Witchcraft? </p> 
 <p>I cannot tell. </p> 
 <p>Why do you not think it is Witchcraft? </p> 
 <p>It is an evil spirit, but wither it be witchcraft I do not know, <lb/> 
Severall said she brought them the Book &amp; then they fell into fits. </p>
