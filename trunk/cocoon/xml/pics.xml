        <figdesc>A scene from the play &quot;Cry Innocent,&quot; 
          performed by the acting company History Alive in the Old Town Hall, 
          Salem, Mass., June, 1999. In this scene, Bridget Bishop, standing in 
          the dock and wearing shackles, listens defiantly to testimony about 
          betwitching a pig delivered by Rebecca Bly, while Judge Hathorne gestures 
          to Rebecca's husband (off stage) to keep quiet. Bridget Bishop's arrest 
          and trial is re-enacted during the summer tourist season in Salem, three 
          times daily in the Old town Hall by Gordon College students</figdesc>

        brochure that depicts several features of local tradition concerning Bridget 
        Bishop. Behind her stands the first church of Salem, across from the town 
        water pump. According to a story, recorded by Cotton Mather, . &quot;As 
        this woman [Bridget Bishop] was, under a guard, passing by the great and 
        spacious meeting-house [church] of Salem, she gave a look towards the 
        house. And immediately a demon invisibly entering the meeting-house, Tore 
        down a part of it; so that though there were no person to be seen there, 
        yet the people at the noise running in, found a Board, which was strongly 
        fastened with several nails, transported unto another quarter of the House.&quot; 
        Bishop had been accused of witchcraft 13 years earlier in a dispute with 
        a neighbor over her orchard and damages caused by her pig, shown at the 
        lower right.</figdesc>

          Thompkins. H. Matteson, was painted in 1855. Four years later, it was

<text>The painting depicts the trial of George Jacobs, Sr. at the Court of 
        Oyer and Terminer in Salem. The scene is an imaginary one, as no records 
        of the actual trial exist, and it its not known who was present at Jacobs' 
        trial on August 5th. The inspiration for the painting comes from two moving 
        documents written by 17year-old Margaret Jacobs: &quot;Margaret Jacobs 
        to her Father&quot; and &quot;Recantation of Margaret Jacobs.&quot; See 
        <!-- xref="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-salem?id=BoySal2&data=/texts/english/salem&tag=public&part=24&division=div1">Salem 
        Witchcraft Papers Volume 2, Case 24</xref --></text>

        <text>In addition to the officials of the court, Matteson portrays several members 
        of the George Jacobs family who became caught up in the witchcraft accusations 
        in Salem Village. Kneeling in the foreground is the white haired, 72 year-old 
        George Jacobs, Sr., wearing an expensive red cape, with his walking stick 
        lying next to him on the floor. At the center of the picture, pointing 
        her finger directly at Jacobs, is his granddaughter Margaret Jacobs. Urged 
        to confess to witchcraft to save her life, she accused her grandfather 
        among others who had already been accused. The distraught figure lunging 
        towards Margaret is her mother Rebecca Jacobs, who was said to have been 
        mentally deranged at the time. She, too, was accused of witchcraft. Standing 
        next to George Jacobs, Sr. is his son, George Jacobs, Jr., whom Matteson 
        shows responding in horror to his daughter's accusation of her grandfather. 
        In the foreground, Matteson places a young man and a girl suffering from 
        &quot;fits,&quot; caused by George Jacobs senior's invisible &quot;specter.&quot; 
        The girl is possibly Sarah Churchill, Jacobs' household servant, or perhaps 
        Ann Putnam, both of whom repeatedly testified that Jacobs' specter attacked 
        them.
        <lb/>
        The black robed magistrates are shown at the bench, with the chief magistrate, 
        William Stoughton, towing over the commotion caused by Margaret's accusation 
        of her grandfather. One of the magistrates, perhaps John Hathorne, who 
        often took the lead role in interrogating the accused in court, holds 
        a written document, in front of the young Margaret Jacobs. This document 
        may be intended to represent Margaret's written confession in which she 
        accuses her grandfather. Judge Hathorne gestures towards the clerk of 
        the court, Stephen Sewall, who is shown writing down Margaret's testimony 
        at the clerk's table, with the other court records lying in front of him 
        . In the background against the windows Matteson shows a group of people 
        who may represent the grand jury. The artist also depicts the large crowd 
        of onlookers that typically attended the trials in Salem. </text>
