in Prison with  Martha Tyler )
Goodwife Tyler  did
say, that, when she was first apprehended, she had no fears upon her,
and did think that nothing could have made her confess against herself.
But since, she had found, to her great grief, that she had wronged the
truth, and falsely accused herself. She said that, when she was brought
to Salem, her brother  Bridges 
rode with her; and that, all along the way from Andover to Salem, her
brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch, since the
afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised out of their fits,
and urging her to confess herself a witch. She as constantly told him
that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of witchcraft, and begged
him not to urge her to confess. However, when she came to Salem, she was
carried to a room, where her brother on one side, and Mr. John Emerson  on the other side,
did tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the Devil
before her eyes at that time (and, accordingly, the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to
beat him away from her eyes); and they so urged her to confess, that she
wished herself in any dungeon, rather than be so treated. Mr. Emerson  told her, once and again,
`Well, I see you will not confess! Well, I will now leave you; and then
you are undone, body and soul, for ever.' Her brother urged her to
confess, and told her that, in so doing, she could not lie: to which she
answered, `Good brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if I confess,
and then who shall answer unto God for my lie?' He still asserted it,
and said that God would not suffer so many good men to be in such an
error about it, and that she would be hanged if she did not confess; and
continued so long and so violently to urge and press her to confess,
that she thought, verily, that her life would have gone from her, and
became so terrified in her mind that she 



owned, at length, almost any thing that they propounded to her; that she
had wronged her conscience in so doing; she was guilty of a great sin in
belying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long as she lived.
This she said, and a great deal more of the like nature; and all with
such affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it
exceeds any pen to describe and express the same.  (Charles
W. Upham, Salem Witchcraft  [Boston, 1867] II,

16 yeares agoe came to my house the wife of John Hirrek  of Beverly w'th an aged woeman she said
was her mother. Goody Reddington
 of Topsfeild come to me for counsel beeing in trouble of spirit. When
the said Reddington  opned her
greifs to me thir was one that she was assaulted by witchcraft that
Goody wiles  her neighb'r
bewitched her &amp; afflicted her many times greiviously, telling me
many particular storys how &amp; when she troubled her, w'ch I have
forgotten. She said allso that a son in law of said Wiles  did come &amp; visit her (shee called him an
honest young man named John   as I take it) &amp; did
pitty her the said Reddington ,
signifying to her that he beleived his mother wiles was a witch &amp;
told her storys of his mother. I allso understood by them, that this
Goody Wiles  was mother in law
to a youth named as I take it Jonathan
Wiles  who about twenty yeares agoe or more did act or was acted
very strangly Insomuch that I was invited to [joyn] with Mr Cobbet  &amp; others at Ipswich to advise &amp; pray for the said
Youth; whome some thought to counterfeit, others to be possessed by the
devill. But I remember Mr Cobbet thought he was
under Obsession of the devil. Goody
Reddingtons discourse hath caused me to have farther thoughts of
the said Youths case whether he were not bewitched.

being also there said to us there is John willes  jun'rs sith hanging in that tree which
stood by the house you may take that and spake with him as you goe to
your work for he is at worke neare the way as you goe along: and
accordingly we took down the sith out of the tree and tould the old
woman that we would ask leave of John
willes  jun'r for his sith before we used it but she was very
angry and said it was a brave world that every one did what they would.
however we went away with the sith: but we had not been gon very fare
from the house but a litle lad came affter us whose name was Efraime willes:  and tould us that his
mother said we had best bring the sith back againe: or Elce it should be
a dear sith to us: however. we went on our way with the sith and asked
the Right owner of it leave for it before we 



used it and went to our work and cutt down as much grass that day as
made about three load of hay: and Returned the sith to the owner: and
after wards made up our hay: and afterwards went to carting of our hay
and went into the meadow and loaded up one load very well and caried it
whom: and went againe into the meadow and loaded a second load and
[bound] it and went to Drive it whom: but when we came to drive our oxen
wee could not make them stire the load tho we had six good oxen and the
Two foremost oxen ware on the upland and the meadow very firme where we
carted constantly: but we strived awhile to make our oxen goe but could
not fit them along; att last one of our wheales fell in up to the stock
altho the meadow was feirme: then we threw allmost all the hay ofe our
cart and thought to trie to git out the cart with sum hay upon it but we
could not then we said one to another it was in vain to s[t] rive for we
thought gooddy willes  was in
the cart and then we threw of all the hay and then we tried to make our
oxen draw out the emty cart which at first they could not doe: but att
last the whele jumpt up at once we knew not how almost redy to thro down
our oxen on their knees then againe we loaded up our load of hay very
well and bound it: and away wee went with it very well tell we came near
to a very dangeros hill to goe down with a load of hay: and then I the
said Joseph Andrew  was by the
foremost oxen and[d] saw sumthing about as bigge as a dogge glance from
a stump or root of a tree along by me and the oxen #[and the oxen] began
to jump: but I could not stire from the place for I know not how long:
and I the said  John Andrew 
being by the hindmost oxen saw nothing but the oxen begining to jump I
cast hold of one of the oxen boxes &amp; was caried down violently that
dangerouse hill I know not how: where was a brooke at the bottom of it
with a bridge and a ford: and the oxen ran into the ford and over thrue
the load of hay their: and when I came to To understand where I was and
saw the oxen ware all well I bega[n] to bethinke my self of my Brother
Joseph:  and Immediatly called
him but he gave no answer. and I began to be trobled for him and went
backward to wards the place where the oxen were affrighted and I called
severall times but he gave me no answer at last I calle[d] and said the
load is overthron then Immediatly he answered me and came unto me: but
how the load should keep upon the wheles runing so violently down that
dangerous hill: &amp; being over throne whare it was we can give no
account unless it was don by summ diabolicall 



art: then againe we gott up our cart and loaded up our hay very firme
resolving to gitt hom our load if we could tho it was night and wh[en]
we had loaded we went to bind our load: but by all the Skill [and]
strength we had we could now wayes bind our load with our Cart rope but
it would hang lose on our load: however we went away whom with our load
and it laid very well for all it was night and [our] load unbound: also
before we got whom many of our friends and neighbors meet us being
consarned for us because we ware so latte &amp; they also saw our cart
Rope hang lose and tould us of it. and wee tould them what mishap we had
that day: and they also tried to fasten the Rope but could not: all
which made us then to think and ever sence have thought: and still doe
thinke that Gooddy willes  who
now stands Charged with High suspition of severall acts of wicthcraft had a hand in our Mishap at that
time. Jno Andrew:  and

Bray Wilkins  v.  John Willard ) The
Deposition of Bray Wilkins  of
Salem Village aged about eighty &amp; one years with reference to John Willard  of s'd Salem, lately
charged with Witchcraft when he was at first complained of by the
afflicted persons for afflicting of them he came to my house greatly
troubled, desiring me with some other Neighbours to pray for him I told
him I was then going from home, &amp; could not stay, but if I could
come home before night I should not be unwilling, but it was near night
before I came home &amp; so I did not answere his desire, but I heard no
more of him upon that account. Whither my not answering his desire did
not offend him, I cannot tell, but I was jealous afterwards that it did.
A little after my wife &amp; I went to Boston at the last Election, when
I was as well in health as in many yeares before, &amp; the Election day
coming to my brother Lft Richard Way's
 house, at noon there were many friends to dine there, they were
sat down at the Table, Mr Lawson
 &amp; his wife &amp; severall more, John Willard  came into the house with my sone
Henry Wilkins  before I sat
down, &amp; s'd Willard  to my
apprehension lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned
in any, I did but step into the next room, &amp; I was presently taken
in a strange condition, so that I could not dine, nor eat any thing, I
cannot express the misery I was in for my water was sodainly stopt,
&amp; I had no benefit of nature, but was like a man on a Rack, &amp; I
told my wife immediately that I was afraid that Willard  had done me wrong, my pain continuing
&amp; finding no relief my jealousie continued: Mr Lawson,  &amp; others there, were all amazed,
&amp; knew not what to do for me: There was a Woman accounted 



skilfull came hoping to help me, &amp; after she had used means, she
askt me whither none of those evil persons had done me damage. I said, I
could not say they had, but I was sore afraid they had, she answered she
did fear so too, as near as I remember. I lay in this case. 3. or. 4.
dayes at Boston, &amp; afterwards with the jeopardy of my life (as I
thought) I came home, &amp; then some of my friends coming to see me
(&amp; at this time John Willard
 was run away) one of the afflicted persons Mercy Lewes came in with them, &amp; they askt
whither she saw any thing: she said yes, they are looking for John Willard  but there he is upon
his Grandfathers Belly (&amp; at that time I was in grevious pain in the
small of my Belly) I continued so in greivous pain &amp; my water much
stopt till s'd Willard  was in
chains, &amp; then as near as I can guess I had considerable ease, but
on the other hand in the room of a stoppage, I was vexed with a flowing
of water, so that it was hard to keep my self dry. On the. 5. July last
talking with some friends about John
Willard  some pleading his innocency &amp; my self &amp; some
others arguing the contrary, within about 1/4 of an hour after that I
had said it was not I, nor my son  Benja Wilkins , but the testimony of the afflicted
persons, &amp; the jury concerning the Murder of my Grandson  Dan: Wilkins that would take away his
life if any thing did, &amp; within about 1/4 hour after this was taken
in the sorest distress &amp; misery my water being turned into real
blood, or of a bloody colour &amp; the old pain returned excessively as
before which continued for about 24. hours together (Reverse)

that, knowingly, she never consented to the afflicting of any person,

Petition   ( Mass. Archives, Vol.
135 No. 59 )   (Petition of the Andover Ministers and Twenty-Two Others --
October 1692)   To his
Excellency the Governour, and Councill, &amp; Representatives, now
Assembled at Boston. The Humble Address of the ministers, and of some of
the Inhabitants of Andover.   We being
deeply sensible of the heavy judgment that the Righteous God hath
brought upon this place, thought it our duty (after our earnest prayers
to the God of Heaven, to give us help from our trouble) to lay before
this Honourable Assembly, our present distressed estate, and to crave a
redress of our greivances. It is well known that many persons of this
Town, have been accused of witchcraft, by some distempered persons in
these parts and upon complaint made have been apprehended and committed
to prison. Now though we would not appear as Advocates for any who shall
be found guilty 



of so horrid a crime, but we heartily desire that this place, and the
whole land, may be purged from that great wickedness: yet if any of our
#[freinds] friends and neighbours have been misrepresented, as tis
possible some of them have been; wee would crave leave (if it might be
without offence) to speak something in their behalf, haveing no other
desighn therein, then that the truth may appear. We can truly give this
Testimony of the most of them belonging to this Town, that have been
accused, that they never gave the least occasion (as we hear of) to
their neerest relations or most intimate acquaintance, to suspect them
of witchcraft. Severall of the women that are accused were members of
this church in full Communion, and had obtained a good report, for their
blameless conversation, and their walking as becometh woemen professing
godliness. But whereas it may be alledged, that the most of our people
that have been apprehended for witchcraft, have upon Examination
confessed it. To which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for those
that freely and upon conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend
the case of some of them to be otherwise. for from the information we
have had and the discourse some of us have had with the prisoners, we
have reason to think that the extream urgency that was used with some of
them by their friends and others who privately examined them, and the
fear they were then under, hath been an inducement to them to own such
things, as we cannott since find thay are conscious of; and the truth of
what we now declare, we judge will in time more plainly appear. And some
of them have exprest to their neighbours that it hath been their great
trouble, that they have wronged themselves and the truth in their
confessions. We are also very sensible of the disstressed
condition of severall poor familyes, on whom this great trouble is
fallen; some #[more] of our neighbors are like to be impoverished &amp;
ruin'd by the great charge they are at to maintain such of their
familyes as are in Prison, and by the fees that are demanded of them,
whose case we pray may be considered. Our troubles which
hitherto have been great, we foresee are like to continue and increase,
if other methods be not taken then as yet have been, for there are more
of our neighb'rs of good reputation &amp; approved integrity, who are
still accused, and complaints have been made against them, And we know
not who can think himself safe, if the Accusations of children and
others who are under a Diabolicall influence shall be received against
persons of good fame. 



We thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good
creditt among our selves, but some Honorable &amp; worthy men of other
places, do suffer in their names by the acusations of afflicted people
in this Town Thus haveing given your Honors some account of our
present troubles, we crave pardon for our boldness in this Address, and
humbly pray this Honored Court to take into their serious consideration
our low and distressed estate: And that the only wise God may bless yo'r
counsels &amp; Endeavors for the welfare of his people, shall be the
prayer of   Dated at Andov'r

(Petition of  John Osgood  and Seven Others --
December 1692)   To his
Excellency the Governour, and Council now sitting at Boston. The humble
Petition, of severall of the Inhabitants  of
Andover, Sheweth   That whereas our Wives
and severall of our neighbours, sometime since, were committed to Salem
Prison, (for what cause your Hon'rs have been informed) and during their
imprisonment have been exposed to great sufferrings, which daily
encrease by reason of the winter comeing on; we had hoped that before
this day they would have had a Goal delivery, but since that hath been
so long deferred, and 



we are very sensible of the extream danger the Prisoners are in of
perishing, if they are not speedily released: have made bold to make our
humble Petition to #[this Honored C] yo'r Honors, to consider the
present distressed and suffering condition of our friends in Prison and
grant them liberty to come home, upon such terms as yo'r Honors shall
Judge most meet. If we might be allowed to plead their Innocency, we
think we have sufficient grounds to make such a plea for them, and hope
their Innocency will in time appear to the satisfaction of others,
however they are at present under uncomfortable circumstances. So

Mass. Archives Vol. 135 No. 67 )  
(Petition of Ten Prisoners
at Ipswich)   To the
Honourable Governer and Councell and Generall Assembly now sitting
 at Boston   The humble petition of us whose names are subscribed hereunto now
prisoners at Ipswich humbly sheweth, that some of us have Lyen in the
prison many monthes, and some of us many weekes, who are charged with
witchcraft, and not being consciouse to our selves of 



any guilt of that nature lying upon our consciences; our earnest request
is that seing the winter is soe far come on that it can not be exspected
that we should be tryed during this winter season, that we may be
released out of prison for the present upon Bayle to answer what we are
charged with in the Spring. For we are not in this unwilling nor afrayed
to abide the tryall before any Judicature apoynted in convenient season
of any crime of that nature; we hope you will put on the bowells of
compassion soe far as to concider of our suffering condicion in the
present state we are in, being like to perish with cold in lying longer
in prison in this cold season of the yeare, some of us being aged either
about or nere four score some though younger yet being with Child, and
one giving suck to a child not ten weekes old yet, and all of us weake
and infirme at the best, and one fettered with irons this halfe yeare
and all most distroyed with soe long an Imprisonment: Thus hoping you
will grant us a releas at the present that we be not left to perish in
this miserable condicion we shall alwayes pray &amp;c. Widow

Dane  on the Andover Outbreak -- January 1693) R'nd
Sr; Whereas there have been divers reports raysed, how, and, by what
hands I know not, of the Towne of Andover, and the Inhabitants, I
thought it my bounden duty to give an account to others, so farr as I
had the understanding of anything amongst us. Therefore doe declare,
that I beleeve the reports have been Scandalous, and unjust, neither
will bear the light, As for that, of the Sive, and Cisers I never heard
of it, till this last Summer, and the Sabboth after I spake publiqly
concerning it since which I beleeve it hath not been tryed, 



As for such things of Charmes, and ways to find their cattle, I never
heard, nor doe I know any Neighbour that ever did so, neither have I any
grounds to beleeve it. I have lived above Fortie fower yeares in the
Towne, and have been frequent among the Inhabitants, and should
certainely heard if so it had been. That there was a suspicion of
Goodwife Carrier among some of us before she was
apprehended, I know. As for any other persons, I had no suspicion of
them, and had Charity been put on, the Divel
would not have had such an advantage against us, and I beleeve many
Innocent persons have been accused, &amp; Imprisoned, the Conceit of
Spectre Evidence as an infallible mark did
too far prevaile with us Hence we so easily parted with our neighbours
of honest, &amp; good report, &amp; members in full Co[mbar ]union, hence
we so easily parted with our Children, when we knew nothing in their
lives, nor any of our neighbours to suspect them and thus things were
hurried on, hence such strange breaches in families, -- severall that
came before me, that spake with much sobrietie, professing their
innocency, though through the Devils subtilty they were too much urged
to Confesse, and we thought we did doe well in so doeing, yet they stood
their ground professing they knew nothing, never saw the devil, never
made a covenant with him, &amp; the like; &amp; some Children that we
have cause to feare that dread has overcome them to accuse themselves in
that they knew not.  Stephen
Johnson   Mary Barker 
the daughters of Lieftenant Barker  , and some others
by what we had from them with suitable affections we have cause to
beleeve they were in the truth, and so held to it, if after many
indeavours they had #[been dismissed] not been overcome to say w't they
never knew This hath been a trouble to me, considering how oft
it hath been sayd you are a witch, you are guilty, &amp; who afflicts
this maid or the like, &amp; more then this hath been sayd, charging
persons with witchcraft, and what flatteries have past from: &amp;
threats and telling them they must goe to prison &amp; this feare have
caused many to fall. our Sinne of Ignorance wherein we thought we did
well, will not excuse us when we know we did amisse but what ever might
be a stumbling block to others must be removed, else we shall procure
divine displeasure, &amp; Evills will
unavoidably breake in upon us. Andover Jan 2. 92 
Yours Sr who am though unworthie a friend to them that are friends to
Sion. 



Concerning my Daughter  Elizabeth Johnson  I never had ground to suspect
her: neither have I heard any other to accuse her, till [by] Spectre evidence she was brought forth, but this I
must say, she was weake, and incapacious, fearfull. and in that respect
I feare she hath. falsely accused her self &amp; others. Not long before
that she was sent for she spake as to her owne particular, that she was
sure she was no witch, and for her Daughter  Elizabeth , she is but simplish at the best, and I
feare the comon speech that was frequently spread among us, of their
liberty, if they would confesse, and the like expression used by some,
have brought many into a snare, the Lord direct &amp; guide those that
are in place, and give us all submissive wills, &amp; let the Lord doe
with me, &amp; mine, what seems good in his owne eys.  (
