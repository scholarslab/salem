<h2><font color="#990000">Increase Mather</font></h2>
<p align="left">INCREASE MATHER (1639-1723): Mather, an influential
Boston minister and father of Cotton Mather, is credited with being
a force for moderation throughout the Salem witchcraft trials and
helping bring them to an end with the circulation of his Cases of
Conscience on October 3, 1692. Increase Mather has drawn fire from
some historians of the period for his hesitancy to take a firm
stand against the trials and executions early in the summer of
1692. However, Mather's unique role as leading minister, President
of Harvard College, and confidant of Governor William Phips placed
him in the precarious position of contesting the witchcraft trials
while supporting the judges. While his actions in 1692 were often
self-contradictory, he was, according to Kenneth Murdock regarded
as "an ally and leader of those whom we see as the most liberal of
his time."</p>
