Burroughs</font></h2>
<p align="left">George Burroughs was the only Puritan minister
indicted and executed in Salem in 1692. He served as minister of
Salem Village from 1680 until he left in 1683. As one of the
succession of three ministers who left the Village in the years
leading up to the trials, he became involved in the Village's
social conflicts. During his stay in Salem he borrowed money from
the Putnam family and when he was unable to pay it back, conflict
with the Putnams arose. It was at this point that he left. Although
he eventually repaid his loan, twelve years later, he was charged,
arrested and brought back to Salem from Wells, Maine. Many members
of the Salem Village and Andover testified against him and called
him the "ring leader" of the witches, a virtual priest of the
devil. Cotton Mather also took particular interest in the trial
because of Burroughs' unorthodox religious beliefs and practices.
He was found guilty and executed on August 19, 1692. His hanging
was the only one attended by Cotton Mather, who urged the
sympathetic crowd against him.</p>
