<h2><font color="#990000">Elizabeth Parris</font></h2>
<p align="left">At nine years old, Elizabeth Parris, daughter of
Salem Village minister Rev. Samuel Parris, played a key role in the
beginnings of the witchcraft trials. Curious to know her future
marital status , Elizabeth, together with her cousin Abigail
Williams, cautiously experimented with fortune telling. Her
behavior led to the first three accusations of witches. Trying to
shield the involvement of his immediate family, the Rev. Samuel
Parris, took Abigail from home and placed her in the home of
Stephen Sewall in Salem, where she eventually recovered. She could
not have predicted that these innocent attempts at predicting the
future would lead to the largest and most deadly witch-hunt in
American history.</p>
