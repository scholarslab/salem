<h2><font color="#990000">George Jacobs, Sr</font>.</h2>
<p align="left">George Jacobs, Sr. was about 72 years old when he
was hanged as a wizard on August 19, 1692, along with three other
men and one woman -- the first time men were executed for
witchcraft in Salem. He was accused, among many others, by his
granddaughter, Margaret Jacobs who was also accused and imprisoned.
Depending on scholarly opinion, he has been seen as the victim of
personal grudges, the casualty of the socio-political climate of
Salem, or the target of cultural system's effects on young,
socially subordinate women.</p>
