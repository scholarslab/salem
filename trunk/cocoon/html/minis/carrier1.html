<p align="left">Calling her a "rampant hag" and the "Queen of
Hell," the Reverend Cotton Mather harbored no doubts that Martha
Carrier deserved to be executed as a witch during the Salem
outbreak on August 19, 1692. The Salem documents themselves,
however, reveal that her crime was not witchcraft but an
independence of mind and an unsubmissive character. A daughter of
one of the founding families of Andover, Martha married a young
Welsh servant, Thomas Carrier, in 1674, by whom she had four
children. The Salem accusation against Martha came only two years
after the selectmen of Andover blamed a smallpox epidemic on her
witchcraft. Although historians have blamed her accusation on
causes ranging from a conspiracy against Andover's proprietary
families to reaction against threats to patriarchal inheritance,
her contentious spirit and the earlier charge of witchcraft seem
the most plausible explanation.</p>
