<h2><font color="#990000">John Hathorne</font></h2>
<p align="left">Born into a well-established Salem family on August
5, 1641, John Hathorne became a local Salem magistrate and was
chosen by Governor Sir William Phips to be a judge in the Salem
Witch Trials. During the trials, Hathorne took on the role of a
prosecutor rather than an impartial judge. Hathorne's questioning
always began with a presumption of guilt rather than innocence, and
he appeared to be on the side of the accusers. Hathorne altered the
tradition of previous witch trials by encouraging those under
examination not only to confess to witchcraft but also to name
others who might be witches - a move that accelerated the number of
accusations. He died in Salem on May 10, 1717, and was later a
prominent target of criticism by his own great-grandson, Nathaniel
Hawthorne.</p>
