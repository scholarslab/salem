<div align="left"><br />
Sarah Good was born to a prosperous innkeeper in 1653. However, her
father's estate became entangled in litigation leaving Sarah Good
in poverty. After the death of her first husband, she married
William Good. The Goods lived a life of begging and poverty in
Salem Village. Sarah was regarded as an unsavory person and has
come to be regarded through literature as the stereotypical witch,
a disreputable old hag. Good was among the first three women
accused of witchcraft in 1692 and was the first to testify. She
never confessed guilt, but, like Tituba, she did accuse Sarah
Osburne, an act that was credited with validating the witchcraft
trials and accusations. Good was hanged as a witch on Tuesday July
19, 1692, but not until after the imprisonment of her six year old
child Dorcas, also accused of witchcraft, and the tragic death of
her infant in prison.<br />
