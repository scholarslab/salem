    Sarah Good was born to a prosperous innkeeper in 1653. However, her father's 
    estate became entangled in litigation leaving Sarah Good in poverty. After 
    the death of her first husband, she married William Good. The Goods lived 
    a life of begging and poverty in Salem Village. Sarah was regarded as an unsavory 
    person and has come to be regarded through literature as the stereotypical 
    witch, a disreputable old hag. Good was among the first three women accused 
    of witchcraft in 1692 and was the first to testify. She never confessed guilt, 
    but, like Tituba, she did accuse Sarah Osburne, an act that was credited with 
    validating the witchcraft trials and accusations. Good was hanged as a witch 
    on Tuesday July 19, 1692, but not until after the imprisonment of her six 
    year old child Dorcas, also accused of witchcraft, and the tragic death of 
    her infant in prison. <br>
