Dane</font></h2>
<p align="left">Francis Dane was born about 1615 in England and
died on February 16, 1607 at the age of eighty-one in Andover,
Massachusetts. Dane was the elderly senior pastor of Andover and a
highly respected leader of the community. In 1682, the congregation
hired a young Harvard graduate Rev. Thomas Bernard to aid Rev. Dane
with his ministerial duties in his old age. There was tension
between the two about their salaries, and the two ministers reacted
very differently to the witch trials of 1692. Initially, Bernard
did much to aid the accusations of witchcraft in Andover, while
Dane had more of his family members accused than any other family
in 1692. Furthermore, it was Dane's early October petitions to the
General Court for pardons, writing against spectral evidence,
filing of slander suits, and bold stance against the witchcraft
trials that are credited with ending the proceedings in Andover so
quickly. Dane is still regarded as the hero of Andover during the
Witch Trials of 1692.</p>
