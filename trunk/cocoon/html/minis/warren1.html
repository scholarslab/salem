<h2><font color="#990000">Mary Warren</font></h2>
<p align="left">Born twenty years before the Salem Witch Trials
began, Mary Warren became one of the most rigorous accusers -- and
also a defender and confessor, a unique role among the accusing
girls of Salem Village. As the servant of John and Elizabeth
Procter, opponents of the trials who thought that the accusers
should be punished, Mary encountered much resistance from the two
regarding her participation in the trials. Most significantly,
Warren introduced the possibility of fraud on the part of the
accusing girls when she stated that they "did but dissemble."
Arthur Miller's play The Crucible focuses on this unique aspect of
Mary Warren's behavior. After her own confession, Warren more
actively participated in the accusations, including those against
the Procters. She was released from jail in June, 1692.<br />
