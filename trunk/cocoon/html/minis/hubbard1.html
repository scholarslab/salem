  <p align="left">Elizabeth Hubbard was seventeen in the spring of 1692 when she 
    and three other girls started accusing people of witchcraft. Like many of 
    the other "afflicted" girls in Salem Village, she was an orphan and lived 
    with her great-aunt and uncle, Dr. William Giggs. Elizabeth played an active 
    role throughout the trials as one of the leading accusers. Her afflictions, 
    fits, trances and testimony all contributed to the conviction and execution 
    of many of the nineteen executed innocent people.<br>
