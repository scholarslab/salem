</center>
Born in England in 1652, Samuel Sewall moved to America as a child
and obtained two degrees in theology before marring into a wealthy
Boston family. As a result, Sewall never became a minister but
rather a wealthy merchant with public stature. He was appointed to
sit as a judge for the witchcraft trials in the Court of Oyer and
Terminer, and he kept a richly detailed daily diary that has helped
scholars piece together the trials. Sewall's public confession of
sin on the Day of Prayer and Fasting (January 14, 1697) five years
after the trials, demonstrate Sewall's remorse for his actions in
condemning innocent people.<br />
