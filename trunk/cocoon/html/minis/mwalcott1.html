Mary Walcott, the daughter of Jonathan Walcott, commander of the Village militia 
and the brother-in-law of Thomas Putnam, was a key accuser in the Salem Witch 
Trials. Walcott was closely related to the Thomas Putnam family; her aunt was 
Ann Putnam,Sr. and her cousin was Ann Putnam, Jr. Although Mary Walcott was one 
of the circle of accusing girls, by the end of the trials she had attracted sixteen 
spectral torturers.<br>
