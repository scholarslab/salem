Tituba Indian holds one of the most infamous (yet still debated)
places in the history of the Salem Witchcraft Trials. Tituba was an
Indian slave in the service of Reverend Samuel Parris, in whose
home the diagnosis of witchcraft was first made. She was the first
accused (along with Sarah Osborne) and was also the first to
confess. Tituba's confession set a precedent and pattern that would
run the course of the trials -- accused witches confessed and then
became accusers themselves, thereby validating the previous
accusations and the need for continuing investigations and trials,
as the court desired. Though Tituba was not executed for her
participation as a "detestable Witch," she was forced to languish
in jail for thirteen months after Parris refused to pay her
imprisonment costs. She was finally freed from jail when an unknown
person redeemed her jail fees and took her from the Village.
Nothing is known about her life beyond Salem Village.<br />
