Committee of the Town of Danvers</font></center>
<p>On May 9, 1992, the Salem Village Witchcraft Victims' Memorial
of Danvers was dedicated before an audience of over 3,000 people.
It was the first such Memorial to honor all of the 1692 witchcraft
victims, and is located across the street from the site of the
original Salem Village Meeting House where many of the witch
examinations took place. The Memorial serves as a reminder that
each generation must confront intolerance and "witch hunts" with
integrity, clear vision and courage.</p>
<p>This memorial project was undertaken by the Salem Village
Witchcraft Tercentennial Committee of the Town of Danvers which
commemorated the 300th anniversary of the witch prosecutions during
1989-1993. The Memorial itself was designed by Committee members
Richard B. Trask; Robert D. Farley, CSI; and Marjorie C. Wetzel.
Finance Chairman Ralph E. Aridff, Jr. raised money for the project
through donations of numerous town, civic, patriotic, business and
ethnic organizations and by individuals. The property was donated
and is now maintained by the Town of Danvers, and the Memorial is
open to the public daily from dawn to dusk.</p>

<center><font size="+1">Memorial Design and
Symbolism</font></center>
<p>The design of the Memorial is highly symbolic in nature. On a
light colored Barre granite sarcophagus measuring 4' x 8' x 4'
rests an oversized representation of a slant-top bible box. In
colonial times such boxes were used as storage containers for
precious volumes and papers. The positioning of the block with the
bible box on top is reminiscent of a colonial pulpit and its
juxtaposition and correct alignment with what would have been the
original Meeting House pulpit across the street is purposeful. Yet
the bible box, a domestic item of furniture, better represents
individual home-inspired devotion, rather than communal,
ecclesiastical worship, denoting the significance of personal
beliefs and morals.</p>
<p>The box is composed of Canadian Pink granite, and on its front
is carved several different and local style rosettes, typical
design features found in both Puritan furniture and gravestones.
The five rosettes banded together by a serpentine vine are Puritan
symbols for eternity. Resting on top of the bible box, and composed
of the same brown-reddish granite as the box itself, is an open
book with an inscription in 17th century typeface reading, "THE
BOOK OF LIFE." In biblical language this phrase represented the
record of those who should inherit eternal life. During the witch
trials numerous persons testified that the accused had signed the
"Devil's book" thus becoming witches and doing the work of the
devil. Those who were executed for witchcraft refused to confess to
being witches, for they wanted to be inscribed in "The Book of
Life." At the time almost all in the Puritan community believed the
accused to be guilty, while today the historical record, a
modern-day "book of life" of sorts, has rectified the former deadly
falsehoods of 1692.</p>
<p>The weight of truth, symbolized in the granite box and book, is
also represented smashing through the falsehood of history,
depicted by a pair of large scale reproduction metal shackles
divided in two by the book and resting broken upon the block of
granite. Curtis M. White, a talented blacksmith, staff member of
the Saugus Ironworks National Park and at the time the resident
overseer of the Rebecca Nurse Homestead, hand-forged the chains.
Carved on the face of the block granite is the inscription "In
memory of those innocents who died during the Salem Village
witchcraft hysteria of 1692."</p>
<p>To the rear of this granite piece stands a three-panel 12 feet
long by 8 feet high granite memorial wall containing in 17th
century spelling form the names of the 24 men and women and one
child who died as a result of the witch hysteria. Also included are
the towns of origin of these people which include besides Salem
Village, Salem Farmes (Peabody), Salem, Andover, Billerica,
Amesbury, Reading, Topsfield, Marblehead and Rowley. Above the
center panel on a granite ellipse is carved the Tercentennial
Committees logo featuring a man grasping an open book. The man's
hair style, robe and neck bands are reminiscent and symbolic of a
17th century cleric with an open bible or a magistrate with an open
law book trying to come to understand and interpret the witch
hysteria which had overtaken much of Massachusetts. The logo was
designed for use of the Tercentennial Committee and donated by Jim
Barina, founder of 'Spellbound,' a Salem, Massachusetts,
advertising agency.</p>
<p>On each side of the Memorial wall stands at a 45 degree angle to
it a wall inscribed to include in their own words brave statements
made by eight of the accused witches during their harrowing
examination just across the street from the memorial location.</p>
