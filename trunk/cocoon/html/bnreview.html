<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <b><br /></b> An
Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />

<p>Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's <i>Salem Possessed</i>
explores the pre-existing social and economic divisions within the
Salem Village community, as an entry point to understand the
accusations of witchcraft in 1692. According to Boyer and
Nissenbaum, the village split into two factions: one interested in
gaining more autonomy for Salem Village and led by the Putnam
family, and the other, interested in the mercantile and political
life of Salem Town and led by the Porter family. Boyer and
Nissenbaum's deft and imaginative look at local records reveals the
contours of communal life in colonial New England and provides a
model through which to understand the witchcraft accusations as
part of a larger pattern of communal strife. Such a tight focus on
communal and social causes for the events of 1692, however, loses
sight of the religious, gendered, and individual forces that played
equally pivotal roles in the outbreak.<br />
<br />
Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's <i>Salem Possessed: The Social
Origins of Witchcraft</i> redefined the standard for the
possibilities social history offers to understand the events and
people of early America. Through a painstaking and creative look at
local records such as legal records, the Salem Village record book,
the minister's book, and tax records Boyer and Nissenbaum
discovered a long-standing pattern of contentious behavior of which
the witchcraft accusations in 1692 was just one episode. Their
analysis provides an invaluable insight into the social history of
New England generally, and the factions of Salem Village that led
to the tragic events of 1692, in particular.</p>
<p>Boyer and Nissenbaum's explanation for the outbreak of
witchcraft accusations in Salem hinges on an understanding of the
economic, political and personal issues which divided village long
before 1692. At bottom, geography and history divided Salem Village
and Salem Town. Situated in the interior from the bustling
mercantile town of Salem, Salem Village remained primarily an
agricultural community. Boyer and Nissenbaum argue that this
polarization of interests between the town and the village created
a similar divide within the village itself. One faction, led by the
Putnam family, most identified itself with the traditional
agricultural activities of the village and consequently supported
the village minister, Samuel Parris, and the drive for greater
autonomy from Salem Town. The opposing faction, led by the Porter
family, identified itself with the mercantile town, near which most
of the Porter faction lived. In opposition to the Putnam faction,
the Porters opposed the minister and wanted greater association
with the town of Salem. The bitter and contentious disputes between
the two factions within Salem Village both before and after the
witchcraft outbreak, demonstrate a pattern of communal conflict
which transcended the events of 1692.</p>
<p>These same fault-lines, according to Boyer and Nissenbaum,
explain the pattern of witchcraft accusations. The same villagers
who stood with the Putnams to support Parris and petition for an
independent church for the village, show up as complaints on
witchcraft indictments in 1692. Similarly, many of the accused
witches in Salem belonged to the Porter faction or, according to
Boyer and Nissenbaum, represented the projection of the grievances
caused by such factionalism upon more obtainable targets like
Rebecca Nurse and Martha Cory. Through such a reconstruction of the
factional village of Salem, Boyer and Nissenbaum explain the Salem
witchcraft episode from within the larger history of the
transformation to a modern capitalist society, and the divisions
and conflicts that naturally arose from this change.</p>
<p>Boyer and Nissenbaum's intensive focus on the dynamics of Salem
Village blind them to other dynamics contributing to the witchcraft
outbreak. Although the outbreak originated in Salem Village, the
majority of the accused hailed from surrounding villages such as
Andover, removed from the Putnam/Porter disputes and known for its
harmonious community life. As Bernard Rosenthal points out, "the
study stops short of inquiring into why the outbreak spread
throughout Massachusetts Bay and caught in its net people having
nothing to do with the quarrels of that particular village." The
dynamics of village dispute can help to explain the origin of the
outbreak, but cannot explain why this outbreak became an
epidemic.</p>
<p><br />
Boyer and Nissenbaum's almost exclusive focus on the socio-economic
dimensions to the witchcraft episode obscures the importance of
individuals and of Puritan religious beliefs. In his review of
<i>Salem Possessed,</i> T.H. Breen argues that Boyer and Nissenbaum
"assume a direct causal relationship between socio-economic
conditions and individual behavior. Indeed, the authors manage to
trace almost all personal motivation back to the pocketbook." While
their deft reconstruction of Salem Village's factious society and
the economic changes which contributed to such divides is quite
convincing, the intellectual jump they make to connect these
pre-existing divisions with the personal motivations of accusers is
largely speculative and circumstantial. Boyer and Nissenbaum's
analysis of communal conflict also omits the religious ideas behind
the trials - the very ideas which the people of Salem would have
believed to be most important. Writing forty-five years before
Boyer and Nissenbaum, Perry Miller believed that "I do not need to
demonstrate that belief in witchcraft was, for the seventeenth
century, not only plausible but scientifically rational," because
in 1939 Miller believed that the subject was well rehearsed. After
the publication of <i>Salem Possessed,</i> however, we could use
such a rehearsal. Miller's work demonstrated the logic of a Puritan
theology which numbered witches and demonical presences as among
the punishments God could inflict upon his inattentive people.
Taking the theological and cosmological logic of the Puritans into
account allows the Salem outbreak to be understood in its own
terms, rather than simply in terms of economic rationalization and
communal strife.</p>
<p>Any complete understanding of the Salem witchcraft accusations
most also attempt to explain why the vast majority of accused
witches were women. Carol Karlsen included <i>Salem Possessed</i>
in her critique of histories of Salem which, "note that witches
were usually women, most works pass over the fact quickly or
conclude that witches were scapegoats for hostilities and tensions
that had little to do with sex or gender." Although the directions
the accusations took undoubtedly reflected pre-existing tensions
within the community, Karlsen argues that the accusations also
reflected societal ideas about women and the ways men reconciled
changes in gender roles.</p>
<p>Although the intensity of Boyer and Nissenbaum's focus on Salem
Village obscured forces foundational to a complete understanding of
the events of 1692, through <i>Salem Possessed,</i> in the words of
one reviewer, "new stage in our understanding of the dynamics of
the processes of community development and social conflicts has
been reached." Boyer and Nissenbaum help us to understand not only
the ways in which the outbreak of accusations in Salem was part of
a larger pattern of communal conflict, but also serve to warn us
that the divisive powers such conflicts have the potential to
instigate modern witch hunts.<br />
