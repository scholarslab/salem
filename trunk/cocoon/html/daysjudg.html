<p>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</p>
<p>Days of Judgment is an informative movie made on the
tercentennial of the Salem Witchcraft trials in 1992. It is an
accurate and fair portrayal of both the causes of the trials and
the trial's consequences. It provides a broad historical overview
with none of the commercial, trivial exaggeration that many have
come to associate with Salem. Instead of using visuals from the
town of Salem's commercial ventures, the film uses engravings,
paintings, actual Salem documents, signatures of participants, and
shots of Danvers town, the old Salem Village. It is well organized
into thirteen segments that each deal with a different facet of the
trial.<br /></p>
<p>"The Days of Judgment" is the title of the first segment, which
is a historical overview of the period leading up to the trials.
Stephen Nissenbaum criticizes other historians for looking at the
trials in a vacuum and ignoring important events that led up to
them. He outlines a more general version of what can be found in
his book Salem Possessed. He speaks of a village facing a changing
economic situation, forming alliances, and battling for
independence against Salem town.<br />
<br />
"Life in the Village" speaks further to the conflict and
uncertainty which the villagers faced every day. Richard Godbeer
explains Salem's conflicts with political officials, Native
Americans, and Quakers. Since the royal charter had recently been
revoked, the Massachusetts colony did not have a legal form of
government when the first accusations occurred. At the same time,
the villagers faced the perceived malevolent threats of Quakers and
Indians, which they saw as strongly linked to witchcraft.<br />
<br />
"A Divided Community" speaks to the interpersonal conflicts which
the town faced during this time of even larger uncertainty.
Nissenbaum explains that there was an independence movement to
create a new meeting house separate from Salem town. This hope for
separation led to the development of factions within the Village.
Barbara Dailey explains the dynamics of a strongly hierarchical
society, where your rank and station was visible every day in your
dress, seating in church, housing, title, and gender. Richard Trask
highlighted the idea of the meeting house as the civic center where
all important town proceedings took place. And, David Hall
introduced the idea of the meeting house as symbolic space. The
meeting house was seen as the garden amidst the wilderness. It
represented peace, safety, and security. Hall also stressed the
idea that the 17th century was alive with "wonder." "Wonder" is a
term that encompasses many different phenomena, but mainly has to
do with God or the devil sending humans messages through invisible
means. Godbeer describes several forms of magic. He believes that
lay folk made a distinction between divination, counter-magic, and
malevolent magic or witchcraft. Even though ministers saw all forms
of magic as the devil's tool and preached against it, many people
practiced some form of magic and believed that humans could wield
that power without the devil's help.<br />
<br />
"The Crime of <i>Maleficia"</i> is defined as harmful magic (the
use of supernatural powers to bring about harm) and can involve
"diabolism," which is the worship of the devil. It is estimated
that between 1450 and 1700, one hundred thousand people were
executed for witchcraft and eighty percent of them were women. Hall
believes that the common lay person was concerned with
<i>maleficia,</i> whereas officials and clergy people were
concerned with diabolism. Brian Levack believes that was because
diabolism threatened Christian civilization. The first book written
on the subject of witchcraft was called <i>Maleficarum,</i>
published in 1486 by the Dominicans as a handbook for investigating
and prosecuting witches. It concluded that women are more easily
drawn to evil and led to widespread witch hunts in England. There
was a big difference between the witch hunts on continental Europe
and those in England. On the continent, witchcraft was considered
to be heresy against the church and punishable by burning, whereas
in England it was civil crime punishable by hanging. The English
tradition is obviously what colonial America was following.<br />
<br />
"The Cosmic Struggles of Samuel Parris" follows the man that every
colonial historian loves to hate. In 1689, Samuel Parris arrived in
Salem Village. Nissenbaum describes how this was a last resort for
Parris after failing as a merchant. The arrival of Parris
intensified the division in the community into pro- and anti-Parris
factions. Nissenbaum describes how Parris saw this not as a
political struggle, but as a cosmic division between forces of good
(pro-Parris) and evil (anti-Parris). Unfortunately, Puritan culture
did not have a language for legitimate opposition to authority and
Parris could not separate the personal, political, or
religious.</p>
<p>"Affliction" gives a brief overview of the breakout of
affliction in Samuel Parris' house. It briefly describes the
divination techniques which the girls were using to try and
decipher the trades of their future husbands, including the "Venus
glass" (an egg white suspended in water). When the Village doctor,
William Griggs, was unable to find a diagnosis for the girls' fits,
he concluded witchcraft.</p>
<p>"Tituba" was Samuel Parris' slave and has also been the subject
of much folklore. She was probably of Native American descent and
was acquired on one of Parris' trips to Barbados. Although
tradition has it that Tituba taught young Abigail Williams and
Betty Parris about the occult, Elaine Breslaw explains that there
is no evidence to support that theory since they were using
traditional English divination techniques. Since Tituba confessed,
her role was defined by what she had to say. She gave a full
detailed story which many people believed and has been incorporated
into common folklore about witches.</p>
<p>"The Devil Hath Been Raised Amongst Us" reminds viewers that the
first three arrests did not end the torment of the afflicted and
many more people were arrested as a result. They detail the story
of Rebecca Nurse's examination and the role which the afflicted
girls play in this unfolding drama.</p>
<p>"The Accused" focuses obviously on the people who were indicted
and convicted of witchcraft. Seventy-five percent of the people
accused at Salem were women. Barbara Daily draws the conclusion
that socially independent women who were not under the supervision
of men were the most likely to be accused. These included healers,
women who were scold and mutterers, and women who collected herbs.
She believes this was partly because women were feared for their
powerful biological capabilities. Hall believes that social
quarrels with subsequent misfortune led to witchcraft accusations.
Her example of this prototype is the fact that Rebecca Nurse was
accused of witchcraft by Ann Putnam Jr. following a property
dispute between the Putnam's and the Nurses.</p>
<p>"Spectral Evidence and the Law" examines the process by which
witches were prosecuted, and progresses from a complaint to arrest
to examination. Accusers had to provide evidence that the accused
made a pact with the devil. Sufficient evidence often led to an
indictment. Levack further adds that the accusers had to prove a
diabolical compact between the devil and the accused. There were
two legal ways of proving this compact: confession or two witnesses
had to testify that she performed an act which implied a compact
with the devil. Because of this strict burden of proof, very few
people were convicted of witchcraft before 1692. In 1692, they
accepted many different forms of proof as valid. The afflicted
girls gave the most damaging proof of witchcraft in their spectral
evidence of torment. Even at the time, there was much disagreement
as to its validity.</p>
<p>"The Court of Oyer and Terminer," meaning "to hear and to
determine," was set up by Governor Phips to hear the witchcraft
trials. The court records are our best guide as to what happened.
There are over five hundred documents, including indictments,
warrants, depositions, and verbatim transcriptions of courtroom
hearings. None of the judges had formal legal training. Unlike
previous witchcraft trials, confessed witches were not executed
immediately whereas those found guilty were. Dailey explains that
confessed witches were given time to examine their souls and
prepare for death before they were executed. The trials ended
before executions of confessed witches took place. Because of this,
the relatives of the accused placed a great deal of pressure on
them to confess in order the buy time and put of execution. When
the witch hunt engulfed the town of Andover, over fifty people
confessed to spare their lives.</p>
<p>"The End of the Trials" basically lays out the chronology for
the end of the trials. On September 8, 1692 the last eight people
were hanged for witchcraft. By October, the afflicted girls were
accusing people from prominent families, including the wife of
Governor Phips. The Court of Oyer and Terminer came under attack.
Increase Mather denounced spectral evidence and declared that it
was better that ten witches escape than one be condemned.
"Confessed" witches began recanting their confessions. Godbeer
explains that October 12 was the end of imprisonment for witchcraft
and October 15 was the date of dissolution for Oyer and Terminer.
In November, a new court was assembled and by January it had heard
52 cases. The court acquitted all but three, and those three people
were pardoned by the Governor. It proved very difficult to convict
witches without the use of spectral evidence. In 1696, many jurors
apologized and in 1706, Ann Putnam Jr. admits that she had been
deluded by the devil. Healing came slowly to Salem Village. In
1752, they won their struggle for independence and became Danvers
town.</p>
<p>"1692 Remembered" addresses the question of what the Salem
trials have come to represent. Many view the trials as a symbol of
intolerance, repression, and injustice. Arthur Miller used the
metaphor of the Salem trials to talk about the Red Hunt in his 1953
play, The Crucible. Brian Levack sees the trials as a warning that
justice can always be miscarried when authority becomes determined
to prosecute non-conformists and political enemies, especially when
the community is behind the persecutions.</p>
