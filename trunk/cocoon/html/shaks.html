<div align="justify"><strong>Explanation</strong>: The caption
under the engraving is an aptly chosen phrase from
Shakespeare&#8217;s play The Comedy Errors (Act I, scene 2). The
words are spoken by a character who fears that witches are
deceiving and cheating him. These fears turn out to be groundless,
involving mistaken identities among several characters. The caption
is appropriate to Calef&#8217;s book which is an attack on the Rev.
Cotton Mather&#8217;s defense of the Salem witch trials, especially
his approval of the use of spectral evidence, which was the basis
of the witchcraft convictions. Specters of those accused of
witchcraft were said to cause the fits and bodily contortions
experienced by the accusers. Later, the spectral visions of the
accusers were determined to be delusions caused by the devil, thus
ending the witch trials. <a href="generic.html">Back to
