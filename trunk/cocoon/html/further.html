        <br>
        The first witchcraft accusations occurred in Salem Village, then a parish 
        of the town of Salem, at the end of February 1692. The accusations began 
        with two young girls who lived in the home of the Rev. Samuel Parris. 
        Prior conflicts within the village had caused the departure of three ministers 
        in the past sixteen years. Almost immediately after Rev. Parris's arrival 
        in 1689, conflicts arose among villagers concerned about the benefits 
        Parris was to receive, including ownership of the parsonage. In 1692 a 
        new Village committee opposed to Parris was elected. Parris's salary was 
        not paid for months, and he began to run out of money and firewood. In 
        January,1692, Parris's 9 year-old daughter <a href="people/e_parris.html">Betty 
        Parris</a> and her 12 year-old cousin Abigail Williams began to behave 
        erratically and exhibit extreme physical contortions. Their actions were 
        similar to that of the Goodwin children in Boston who had fallen into 
        fits and accused a servant woman named Glover of bewitching them. Glover 
        was later convicted and hanged as a witch. The Goodwin case and the children's' 
        &quot;afflicted&quot; behavior were described in detail in a widely read 
        book, Memorable Providences, written by<a href="people/c_mather.html"> 
        Rev. Cotton Mather</a>, a prominent Boston minister, and published in 
        1689. </p>
      <p>In Salem Village the Rev. Parris and other local ministers were unable 
        to remedy the girls' behavior through prayer. Doctor William Griggs, a 
        village physician, was consulted, and he pronounced the girls to be suffering 
        from the &quot;Evil Hand.&quot; Several young friends of Betty Parris 
        and Abigail Williams, also exhibited similar behavior. They were all children 
        of influential families in the Village and supporters of Rev. Parris: 
        Ann Putnam, Jr., daughter of Sgt. Thomas Putnam, <a href="people/hubbard.html">Elizabeth 
        Hubbard</a>, grand niece of William Griggs,<a href="people/mlewis.html"> 
        Mercy Lewis</a>, a servant in the home of Thomas Putnam, and <a href="people/mwalcott.html">Mary 
        Walcott, </a>daughter of Capt. Jonathan Walcott. A neighbor, Mary Sibley, 
        secretly resorted to a well-known magical procedure. She told Parris's 
        slave, John Indian, to make a witch's cake, using some of the girls' urine, 
        and to feed it to a dog to discover the names of the witches afflicting 
        them. Subsequently, the girls began to name people in the Village. The 
        first to be accused were easy targets of social prejudice: <a href="people/good.html">Sarah 
        Good</a>, a homeless mother and beggar, <a href="people/tituba.html">Tituba</a>, 
        the Indian slave of the Rev. Parris; and <a href="people/osborne.html">Sarah 
        Osburn</a>, a woman whose marriage and inheritance dispute attracted disfavor. 
        Titbua, the first to be examined by the magistrates, admitted that she 
        had been beaten by Rev. Parris and told to confess. She confessed volubly 
        and in great detail to an alliance with the Devil, and she named Osburn 
        and Good as witches. Sarah Good also accused Sarah Osburn before the magistrates. 
        Tituba's confession and Good's confirmation Osburn's involvement convinced 
        the ministers and magistrates of a local conspiracy with the Devil. Bolder 
        accusations followed. Emboldened, the girls accused Martha Cory and <a href="people/nursecourt.html">Rebecca 
        Nurse</a>, both respected members of the church. At the end of March, 
        people in nearby Ipswich accused Rachel Clinton, an abandoned wife, who 
        had previously been accused of witchcraft. All were jailed on charges 
        of witchcraft and shackled with iron fetters. </p>
      <p>The newly appointed governor <a href="people/phips.html">Sir 
        William Phips</a> returned from England in the middle of May. He arrived 
        with a new royal charter and was empowered to govern. With dozens of accused 
        witches filling the jails and with more accusations threatening to overwhelm 
        the local courts, Governor Phips established a special court of Oyer and 
        Terminer (&quot;to hear and determine&quot;) to try the backlog of cases. 
        In June, the first to be executed was <a href="people/bishop.html">Bridget 
        Bishop</a>, an outspoken woman who had been accused of witchcraft twelve 
        years earlier. The accusations continued and began to spread outside Salem 
        Village, filling the jails in Salem, Boston, Cambridge, and Ipswich. Accusations 
        also began to spread up the social ladder to people of high social status, 
        such as Salem's richest merchant, <a href="people/english.html">Philip 
        English</a>, and the famed sea Captain John Alden. The most active accusers 
        lived in Salem Village, and this community suffered the most from executions, 
        while the people of Andover sustained the largest number of accusations.</p>

        The court of Oyer and Terminer was headed by Lieutenant Governor William 
        Stoughton, appointed by Governor Phips. Stoughton supported the validity 
        of spectral evidence used by the girls and young women in their accusations. 
        A &quot;specter&quot; was the image of a person visible only to the witchcraft 
        victim whom the specter was said to have attacked in some way. The use 
        of spectral evidence was common in New England witchcraft trials, but 
        never played a decisive role. The <a href="people/c_mather.html">Rev. 
        Cotton Mather,</a> writing on behalf of several Boston ministers, advised 
        caution in relying on such evidence but at the same time urged the court 
        to undertake &quot;the speedy and vigorous prosecution&quot; of anyone 
        guilty of witchcraft. In the Salem, spectral evidence was used to initiate 
        legal complaints, alleging harmful pinching or choking, in order to bring 
        people into court on charges of witchcraft, with the presumption of guilt. 
        As the documents reveal, the magistrates were successful in obtaining 
        dozens of confessions of witchcraft, which meant testifying to having 
        made a covenant with the Devil. The records show that 47 people confessed 
        to witchcraft, and many did so when it was apparent that confession would 
        put off a trial. This was an unprecedented exception to the law pertaining 
        to capital offenses. Much persuasion and some torture was used to make 
        people confess to a covenant with the Devil. All those who confessed were 
        saved, whereas those who maintained their innocence were executed. This, 
        again, was unprecedented legal procedure. When some confessors recanted 
        their false confessions, for reasons of conscience, serious doubts about 
        the confessions of others were raised, and the legal process called into 
        question. </p>
      <p>In early October, the <a href="people/i_mather.html">Rev 
        Increase Mather</a>, minister of North Church and President of Harvard 
        College, together with other ministers in Boston, such as the <a href="people/swillard.html">Rev. 
        Samuel Willard</a>, prevailed upon <a href="people/phips.html">Governor 
        Phips</a> to stop the proceedings of the special court in Salem and to 
        disallow the use of spectral evidence. Public opinion was also changing, 
        as indicated in a <a href="http://aleph.lib.virginia.edu:8080/cocoon/modern-english/contents.BurNarr.xml">famous 
        letter by Thomas Brattle</a>. Without the admission of spectral evidence 
        and without the court room performances of the &quot;afflicted&quot; girls, 
        convictions of witchcraft soon came to an end. In January, Phips appointed 
        the Superior Court of Judicature to try the backlog of cases and begin 
        clearing the jails. In a letter of explanation sent to England, Eventually, 
        <a href="http://aleph.lib.virginia.edu:8080/cocoon/modern-english/contents.BurNarr.xml">Phips 
        wrote a letter of explanation</a> to the Crown saying that he stopped 
        the trials because &quot;I saw many innocent persons might otherwise perish. 
        Phips cited his absence from Boston while fighting Indians and the zealousness 
        of Stoughton for allowing the Salem trials get out of hand.</p>
      <p><b>Aftermath</b></p>
      <p>Despite strong opposition, Samuel Parris clung to his position as the 
        pastor of Salem Village, admitting too late that &quot;I may have been 
        mistaken.&quot; He was forced to leave the Village in 1696. In 1697 a 
        Day of Repentance was declared in Boston. On that day<a href="people/sewall.html"> 
        Samuel Sewall,</a> a prominent magistrate on the court of Oyer and Terminer, 
        rose from his seat in South Church to confess the &quot;blame and shame&quot; 
        of the witch trials in a statement read by <a href="people/swillard.html">Rev.Samuel 
        Willard</a>. Twelve jurors who also served on that court confessed to 
        &quot;the guilt of innocent blood.&quot; Years later, in 1706 Ann Putnam, 
        Jr, one of the most active accusers, stood in her pew before the Salem 
        Village church while the Rev. Joseph Green read her confession of &quot;delusion&quot; 
        by the devil. </p>
      <p>In 1711, the courts of Massachusetts Bay began to make monetary restitution 
        to the families of those who were jailed. The names of some of those condemned 
        and executed were cleared; and the process of clearing names of the condemned 
        from the court records continues today.<br>
