      <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <br>
        An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
        Spring Semester 2001</b> <br>
        <br>
        In late February of 1692, Reverend Samuel Parris called in a doctor to 
        examine his nine-year-old daughter, Betty, and eleven-year-old niece, 
        Abigail Williams-both of whom were suffering from spontaneous fits. The 
        children were soon diagnosed as victims of witchcraft, setting off an 
        outbreak of panic and hysteria, which would sweep throughout Salem Village 
        and its neighboring towns that year. Historians have long pointed the 
        collective finger of blame at the Parris's slave, Tituba, one of the three 
        women first accused of witchcraft, and the only member of this unfortunate 
        trio to survive the year.<br>
        <br>
        Many interpretations of the Salem Trials acknowledge the pivotal role 
        Tituba's confession played in legitimizing the early suspicions and subsequent 
        investigations of witchcraft, seizing on the vivid descriptions of the 
        devil and his minions that she provided to the examining justices. A number 
        of sources also assert that Tituba also introduced supernatural ideas 
        to the "afflicted girls." These scholars claim Reverend Parris had purchased 
        her in Barbados, unaware of the voodoo and witchcraft practices she would 
        eventually undertake under the roof of the Salem parsonage. <br>
        <br>
        However, the mantle of guilt so eagerly thrust upon Tituba may not be 
        rightfully hers (and at the very least, not hers alone). Later investigations 
        have only raised more questions about the very little verifiable information 
        available on her. Most of the perceptions and understandings of Tituba, 
        today commonly accepted as fact, are actually based on local tradition 
        and fictional literature rather than actual court documents or eye-witness 
        accounts. Admittedly, the legend of Tituba as the "Black Witch of Salem" 
        (a posthumous appellation which immediately suggests interesting racial 
        and class connotations) may be more mysterious and entertaining than the 
        accurate historical extent of her influence on the Salem trials; nevertheless, 
        the ways in which this myth has been constructed are fascinating as well. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In all of the court documents relating to the Witchcraft Trials, Tituba's 
        identity is listed as that of an "Indian Woman, servant" (for example, 
        Warrant vs. Tituba and Sarah Osborne -SWP 745). But as scholars have recently 
        pointed out, somewhere in the development of the Salem lore, Tituba's 
        racial heritage has been transformed and confused-thus she appears in 
        texts variously as "Negro," "half-breed," "colored," or "half-Indian, 
        half-Negro." Assumptions about her origins range from the island of Barbados 
        to Africa to Native American. This confusion necessarily complicates any 
        understanding of the consequential and critical part traditionally assigned 
        to Tituba; we must consider how racial stereotypes and presumptions have 
        contributed to the varying amounts of blame she is forced to bear.<br>
        <br>
        Truthfully, Tituba's story may never be clearly sorted out. Her status 
        as a slave constrains any attempts to uncover official records and papers 
        relating to her. The little glimpse of her life that is available is provided 
        only by the court transcripts themselves. Though Tituba's words may resonate 
        to us through the court records, she cannot tell her version of the events 
        leading up to the Trials, she cannot share her own history and memory 
        of Salem and life before it. In addition to Tituba's own recorded words, 
        we can obtain some information based on what her contemporaries said of 
        her. Beyond these strict limitations however, we can realistically draw 
        no further conclusions as to her racial identity, affinity for witchcraft 
        and stories of the occult, nor motivations for confessing to the accusations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        What we do know is from the historical documents is that Tituba was in 
        fact a slave in the Parris home at the time of Betty and Abigail's initial 
        sufferings. Tradition holds that she was married to another slave, John 
        Indian, and the couple was purchased by Reverend Parris during time he 
        spent in Barbados. Tradition, however, does not a history make. Tituba 
        and John Indian did reside with the Parrises; Samuel Parris had a plantation 
        in Barbados, and he owned two slaves after he returned to Boston, and 
        she could have come from Barbados. However, the story that Tituba struck 
        the "fatal spark" and ignited simmering tensions in Salem Village by enthralling 
        the local teenage girls with her stories of African or Caribbean voodoo 
        and magic spells must be recognized for what it is --a story. It was not 
        her "voodoo spells and stories" which, in fact, caused the girls' initial 
        hysterics but their practice of forbidden fortune telling. <br>
        <br>
        Nowhere in the court records or contemporary accounts is Tituba said to 
        have taught the practice of fortune telling to the girls in Rev Parris' 
        house. The fortune telling technique that the girls' used, as reported 
        by one of them to the Rev. John Hale, was an egg white in a glass of water. 
        This was a commonly known device in New England at the time, and it was 
        condemned by the Puritans as a demonic practice. According to the Rev. 
        Hale, one of the girls saw a "specter in the likeness of a coffin" in 
        the glass, and she and another girl fell into fits. Tituba did not confess 
        to the teaching of fortune telling; she confessed to signing the Devil's 
        book, flying in the air upon a pole, seeing a cats wolves, birds, and 
        dogs, and pinching or choking some of the "afflicted" girls. She also 
        said she was beaten by her owner, Rev. Parris, and was told to confess 
        to witchcraft, which she did -- and what she confessed to was all culturally 
        European, not African or Caribbean.<br>
        <br>
        Tituba's confession, however, did ignite a "spark" in the court, especially 
        when she named the other accused witches, Good and Osborne, as her accomplices. 
        Confession is what the judges were looking for, and Tituba's "evidence" 
        of a conspiracy of witches in Salem Village stimulated the court and the 
        girls to find and convict more people. <br>
