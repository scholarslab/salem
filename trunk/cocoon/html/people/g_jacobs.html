<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was born ca. 1620. Not much is known about
when he came to Massachusetts Bay Colony, or about his first wife.
He had three children from his first marriage, all born in Salem.
George Jr. (b. ca. 1649), Mary (b. ca. 1650), and Ann (b. ca.
1655). He bought land in Salem around 1658 and married his second
wife, Mary, about 1673. He had lived in Salem for a little over
thirty years when he was accused of witchcraft.</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was arrested on May 10, 1692, along with his
granddaughter Margaret Jacobs. He was examined twice, on the day of
his arrest and on the following day. His trial took place in early
August, and he remained in prison from the time of his arrest until
his execution on August 19.</p>
<p>His primary accuser was Sarah Churchill, who was a servant in
his home. She came from a wealthy family of English gentry in Maine
but was most likely orphaned in Indian Wars. She, like Margaret,
had been accused of witchcraft and, in her confession, accused
others. George Jacobs granddaughter Margaret herself confessed to
witchcraft and accused her grandfather among others who had already
been accused in order, she wrote, "to save my life and to have my
liberty." The list of accusers against Jacobs did not end there. It
swelled to include Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, Mercy Lewis,
Elizabeth Hubbard, Mary Walcott, Sarah Bibber, Mary Warren, Joseph
Flint, Thomas Putnam, John Putnam, Jr., and John DeRich.</p>
<p>The women accused his Jacobs' specter of beating them with his
walking stick and other physical abuses. Not only did the women
testify that Jacobs afflicted them, they also testified to
witnessing the afflictions of the others. During his testimony,
John DeRich, a sixteen-year old boy, was the only person to claim
that Jacobs afflicted him. The Putnam men testified that they
witnessed the afflictions that Mary Walcott and the other women
suffered on May 11 at the hands of Jacobs' specter.</p>
<p>The Puritans believed that witches and wizards had proof of
their covenants with the Devil on their bodies. Doctor George
Herrick was sent to examine Jacobs' body for the witch's "teat,"
and found one on his right shoulder. This slight protuberance on
his skin combined with the spectral evidence made the case strong
enough for indictment.</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. emerges as an interesting person from the
records of his examinations on May 10 and 11. He was incredulous
from the moment the first accuser, Abigail Williams, cried out
against him. He laughed in court, always a risky response and said:
"Because I am falsely accused.-Your worships all of you do think
this is true?" One of his most famous protest was the defiant
assertion, "You tax me for a wizard, you may as well tax me for a
buzzard I have done no harm." Emphatically portraying his
unwavering Christian faith, he declared, "Well: burn me, or hang
me, I will stand in the truth of Christ, I know nothing of it."
Several times he argued that "The Devill can go in any shape" or
"can take any likeness." This was sound theological doctrine at the
time, warning the court that it was doing the Devil's work by
accusing innocent people. The judges, however, believed that the
Devil cannot take a person's form "without [his] consent."</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr. was then indicted, tried, and found guilty of
witchcraft. He was hanged on August 19, 1692 with George Burroughs,
John Proctor, John Willard, and Martha Carrier. This was the first
time men were executed as witches in Salem. Meanwhile, Jacobs'
granddaughter Margaret Jacobs was free from danger after confessing
and accusing her grandfather but remained in jail. Her father,
George Jacobs, Jr., was also accused but fled from Salem Town. When
he did so, he left behind his wife, Rebecca, in jail facing
witchcraft charges. She became severely emotionally disturbed and
was most likely ruled mentally incompetent and escaped conviction.
George Sr.'s second wife, Mary, survived him and remarried on June
23, 1693 to John Wilds whose wife had been hanged as a witch on
July 19, 1692. Jacobs body was retrieved from Gallows Hill by his
family and buried on his land. In the 1980's his body had to be
moved quickly, due to the sale of the Jacobs family property,. His
bones were kept in storage in the Danvers Archive until 1992 when
he was finally put to rest in the Rebecca Nurse Cemetery.</p>
<p>George Jacobs, Sr.'s role in the witch trials has been
interpreted in several ways. Bernard Rosenthal views him as the
victim of fabrication. For example, Ann Putnam and Abigail Williams
knowingly put pins in their hands and accused his specter of
putting them there to add to evidence against him (<i>Salem
Story</i>). He was also a victim of the life-saving strategy that
the accused learned during the early course of the trials: confess
and your life will be spared. Two of his primary accusers were
among the accused who confessed to save themselves..</p>
<p>Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum interpret the trials in
socio-economic and political terms. They argue that many members of
the more rural and agricultural Salem Village (e.g. the Putnam
family) were threatened by those with economic and political
connections to Salem Town (e.g. the Porter family), the seaport and
center of emerging capitalism. Salem Village had been trying to
assert its independence from the Town by establishing its own
church, and inhabitants of the Village with ties to the Town were
seen as threats to the cause of Village independence. As such, the
majority of accusers was from the Village and the majority of the
accused who lived on the western side of the Village nearer to the
Town. George Jacobs, Sr.'s son, George, was good friend of the
Porters, making the family vulnerable to accusations, particularly
from the Putnams. The phenomenon of the accused becoming accusers
was due, they argue, to the swarm of accusations made in the heat
of politics and economics. Eventually the confusion had to fall
back on itself.</p>
<p>Carol Karlsen offers a more gender-oriented analysis. The
"possessed accusers" were usually subordinate members of society
such as servants. Many of them, like Sarah Churchill, were orphans.
Their prospects for improving their social standings were virtually
nonexistent since they had no families and no dowries to support
them. Totally dependent upon the will of others, their discontent
and anxiety would have been quite marked. Puritan society, however,
did not tolerate socially aggressive and assertive women. Their
fears were then converted, psychologically, into the belief that
they were either witches or were possessed. After all, Carol
Karlsen argues, a society that teaches the existence of possession
will invariably contain persons who think they are possessed and
are believed to be so by others. As for the specific reason that
Sarah Churchill accused George Jacobs, he may have been seen as a
tormentor or harsh master since most of the accusations contained
charges of physical abuse.</p>
<p>All of these explanations fall short, however. None of them
explains why Jacobs own granddaughter would accuse him of all
people or why such a large number of accusations flew at Jacobs,
except for the fact that he publicly denounced the circle of
"afflicted" girls, thus opening them to charges of fraud and
compliance with the Devil. If modern students and scholars find it
hard to explain why so many people would spend their time accusing
a 70 year-old man, it is quite easy to see why George Jacobs, Sr.
laughed and told the judges that he could not believe this was
happening.</p>
