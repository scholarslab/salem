<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>William Phips was born on February 2, 1651 in the then remote
trading village of Woolwich, Maine. Though most historical
accounts, including Cotton Mather's biography, traditionally viewed
Phips' upbringing as socially disadvantaged, there is now evidence
that his family was moderately prosperous. Phips' father co-owned
and operated a trading post plantation involved in the trade of fur
and weapons between local Wabanaki Indians and English settlers.
Phips was one of the youngest of fourteen children born to two
different fathers. Formal education was rare in rural Maine, and
Phips was illiterate until he began to study in Boston.<br />
<br />
In young adulthood, William Phips moved to Boston as a ships
carpenter after a four-year apprenticeship near his home. He then
married Mary Spencer Hull in 1673, the widow of the prosperous
Boston merchant, John Hull. It is probable that William and Mary
knew each other as children since both their fathers interacted
through business in the same region of Maine. With significantly
more social status in Boston, Phips became a sea captain. Knowing
that it would take a long time to gain capital as a simple ship
captain, he needed to broaden his trading territory. In Daniel
Defoe's 1697 Essay upon Projects, DeFoe describes Phips as a
"projector," one who "sought wealth and advancement through
money-making schemes financed by others." Phips traveled to London
in 1683 to seek patronage and funding for treasure hunting among
sunken Spanish ships in the Caribbean, and he acquired the
financial backing that he needed. With his crew and ship, Phips
sailed to the Caribbean, finding substantial treasure in the sea in
1687 when he and his ship, the James and Mary, came across the
wreck of the Spanish ship, Concepcion. The crew took between
205,000 to 210,000 English pounds of treasure, an incredible amount
of money for the day. One tenth was given to the royal crown and
Phips profited by 11,000 pounds, and thus gained a good amount of
fortune and fame in London.<br />
<br />
In recognition to his loyalty to the Crown for returning to England
with his booty, Phips was called to Windsor Castle and was knighted
by King James II on June 28, 1687 at the age of 36. This was truly
a remarkable achievement for a young man of no nobility, born in
the backwoods of New England. Phips returned to Boston as New
England's new provost marshal general, a legal position for which
he had no experience. He did not remain in Boston long and returned
to London giving up his post. Before this trip, he befriended the
President of Harvard College, Rev. Increase Mather, and his son the
Rev. Cotton Mather, a relationship that would prove to be
politically helpful.</p>
<p>In 1689, he made a profession of faith at Cotton Mather's Church
and was baptized. While Phips may have found a new sense of
spirituality, it is possible that this religious conversion was a
means to bring himself closer to the two influential Mathers. The
Mathers ensured that Phips was chosen to command military
expeditions against the French colonies of Acadia and Canada. These
expeditions, especially in Canada were disastrous. For the next two
years, Phips resided in London, petitioning for the Massachusetts
Charter along with Increase Mather. When the new charter was
granted in 1691, Mather used his influence to nominate Phips to be
the first Royal Governor of the Colony under the new charter.</p>
<p>When Phips and Mather returned to Massachusetts on May 14, they
arrived over two months after the witchcraft accusations began in
Salem Village. Already, magistrates were clamoring for the trial of
the accused, many of which were already in prison. Phips ordered
that "Irons should be put upon those in prison" and subsequently
created the Court of Oyer and Terminer, to "hear and determine" the
large backlog of cases. Phips placed prominent and experienced men
of Boston and Salem on the new court, under the new
lieutenant-governor, William Stoughton whom he placed in charge.
This would be a decision that would scar Phip's character in
history, as Stoughton was an unrelenting zealot, who looked to find
guilt by means of spectral evidence, in nearly every one accused of
witchcraft. The court's aggressive use of spectral evidence and the
seeking of confessions, backed up by naming new suspects, led to
the unrelenting spread of witchcraft accusations across the eastern
Colony and brought discredit upon the trials.<br />
<br />
Years later, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts determined the Court
of Oyer and Terminer to be illegal in order to avoid lawsuits, but
the court was indeed a legal entity in 1692, created by the
legitimate royal governor. Phips remained in Boston throughout the
summer until mid-August when departing for Pemaquid in Maine to
fortify defenses. Before leaving, he granted a reprieve to Rebecca
Nurse, one of the condemned, but this was subsequently withdrawn.
Whether Stoughton, or perhaps the Mathers, had some influence on
this decision is unknown. Nevertheless, Phips failed to recognize
from the beginning the problems associated with the trials, most
notably that innocent people were being convicted and executed on
the basis of spectral evidence.<br />
<br />
Upon returning to the colony, Phips "found many persons in a
strange ferment of dissatisfaction . . . [and] found that the
Devill had taken upon him the name and shape of several persons who
were doubtless innocent." Phips had been known to play with
astrology, and was a believer in the existence of witchcraft.
Nevertheless, he knew the court was making grave mistakes, no doubt
coming to this conclusion after speaking with Increase Mather who
"unequivocally condemned spectral evidence" in Cases of
Conscience.<br />
<br />
Phips took a stronger role against his lieutenant governor,
pardoning eight people whom Stoughton condemned to die, months
after the executions had stopped. Phips chastised Stoughton for his
ruthless abandonment of order in a letter to the King on February
21, 1693. Though Phips used this letter to defend himself, the fact
remains that Phips created the Court due to the insistence of the
clerical and political authorities in Boston, for what he thought
was a legitimate legal need. Though Phips did eventually put an end
to the Court, his failure to control the court's aggressive actions
during the summer allowed the persecutions to continue. If Phips is
to be judged innocent by history, it is only due to ignorance about
the misuse of spectral evidence and his trust in the judgment of
his clerical friends, Increase and Cotton Mather, and his
lieutenant governor William Stoughton.</p>
<p>Sir William gained enemies over the next couple years by his
failure to gain English control over French and Native American
forces in New England and Canada. The King recalled him to England
where he died of fever on February 13, 1693.</p>
