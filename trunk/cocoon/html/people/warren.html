        <p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <br>
          An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
          Spring Semester 2001</b> </p>
        <p>At the time the Salem witchcraft trials began, Mary Warren was twenty 
          years old and employed as a servant in the household of John Procter 
          of Salem Village. Before her first formal examination on April 19, 1692, 
          Warren participated mildly in the afflicted girls' accusations. Both 
          John and Elizabeth Procter disagreed with the conduct of the trials. 
          Therefore, when John Procter discovered that Mary Warren participated 
          in the accusations he threatened to whip her until her senses returned. 
          After Mary Warren stayed in town the night of Rebecca Nurse's examination, 
          Samuel Sibley went to court and testified to Procter's opinions about 
          the accusers and about Mary's participation in the accusations. Sibley 
          claimed that: "Proctor replyed if they [the accusers] were let alone 
          so we should all be Devils & witches quickly they should rather be had 
          to the Whipping post but he would fetch his jade [Mary Warren] Home 
          & thresh the Devil out of her & more to the like purpose crying hang 
          them, hang them. And also added that when she [Mary Warren] was first 
          taken with fits he kept her close to the Wheel & threatened to thresh 
          her, & then she had no more fits till the next day he was gone forth, 
          & then she must have her fits again firsooth" (SWP II: 683-684)..</p>
        <p>Both of Mary Warren's parents died before this stage in her life. This 
          situation forced Warren to become a servant and support herself since 
          she had no funds or property to claim. Some of Mary's anxiety over the 
          loss of her parents surfaced during the trials. The document in which 
          John DeRich accused George Jacobs, Sr., states, "that Mary Warrens mother 
          did appeare to this Deponent [John DeRich] this day with a white man 
          and told him that goodwife Parker and Oliver did kill her." In her statement 
          against Alice Parker, Mary Warren also claims that she killed her mother 
          and afflicted her sister, Elizabeth, "she [Alice Parker] also told me 
          she: bewiched my mother & was a caus of her death: also that: she bewiched 
          my sister: Eliz: that is both deaf & dumb." Having no family and working 
          for a man who beat her, it is not very surprising that, when accused 
          of witchcraft herself, Mary Warren sought the public attention and legal 
          protection of being an aggressive accuser of local witches. </p>
        <p>On April 19, 1692, the magistrates in Salem began their questioning 
          of Mary Warren. "I am innocent" were the first words out of her mouth. 
          At this point in the trials no one had been hanged, so the clues as 
          to how avoid being convicted had not yet been discovered. Mary Warren, 
          however, quickly learned that assertions of innocence did not save, 
          but following the judges' lead during questioning did help the defendant. 
          Warren provided many evasive answers during her first examination, possibly 
          because she was unsure as to how to not be convicted. Throughout this 
          examination she continuously fell into fits, which often followed the 
          fits of the other girls in the courtroom. At one point, Mary became 
          so afflicted by the apparitions that tortured her that she had to be 
          removed from the courtroom, and Bridget Bishop was then brought in for 
          questioning:</p>
        <p>"Afterwards she [Mary Warren] started up, & said I will speak & cryed 
          out, Oh! I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it, & wringed her hands, 
          & fell a little while into a fit again & then came to speak, but immediately 
          her Teeth were set, & then she fell into a voilet fit, & cryed out, 
          Oh Lord help me, Oh good Lord save me! And then afterwards cryed again, 
          I will tell, I will tell, & then fell into a dead fit againe. And afterwards 
          cryed, I will tell, they did, they did, they did, & then fell into a 
          violent fit again. After a little recovery she cryed I will tell, I 
          will tell, they brought me to it; & then fell into a fit again: which 
          fits continuing, she was ordered to be had out, & the next to be brought 
          in, viz: Bridget Byshop" (SWP II: 794).</p>
        <p>Even after being brought back into the courtroom, Warren continued 
          her fits until the magistrates held a private meeting with her. After 
          that, Mary Warren began to confess and, once she did, the court recorder 
          noted that, "not one of the sufferers was afflicted during her examination 
          after once she began to confess, though they were tormented before." 
          While in prison, Mary Warren changed her story. Her fits lessened, and 
          she began to implicate the Procters in the mysterious events occurring 
          in Salem. Following the examination in prison, Warren faced two more 
          examinations: one on April 21 and the other on May 12. Now a confessed 
          witch, Warren aggressively accused others of alliances with the devil. 
          At this point, Warren actively accused the Procters of performing certain 
          deeds, although she hesitated to call them a witch and a wizard. By 
          the end of her examinations, Mary was established as an accuser, and 
          she safeguarded her life by providing the magistrates with ample accusations 
          and evidence.</p>
        <p>Mary Warren's testimony did more than save her life, it also represented 
          a turning point in the trials. For the first time fraud was introduced. 
          Yet the judges made no move to aid the innocent, and they continued 
          to encourage the accusers. In Edward Bishop, Sarah Bishop, and Mary 
          Easty's complaint against Mary Warren they stated that, "for Said Mary 
          warrin when I was Aflicted I thought I saw the Apparission of A hundred 
          persons: for Shee said hir Head was Distempered that Shee Could not 
          tell what Shee Said, And the Said Mary tould us that when Shee was well 
          Againe Shee Could not Say that Shee saw any of Apparissons at the time 
          Aforesaid -." During Warren's first examination, Elizabeth Hubbard "testifyed 
          that a little after this Mary was well, she then said that the afflicted 
          persons did but dissemble." Both of these statements suggest that either 
          Warren was mentally unstable, or that she and the accusers were participating 
          in concocted lies. Keeping in mind the above statements, Mary's remarkable 
          description in the prison of Giles Cory's clothes could possibly be 
          explained by the fact that the accusers were "dissembling" - and not 
          that Giles Cory was afflicting Mary at that very moment. In <i>Salem 
          Story,</i> Bernard Rosenthal claims Warren understood that "cooperation 
          with the accusers proved salutary" and that her decision to become an 
          active accuser provided a great lesson to others who would later employ 
          the same tactic. </p>
