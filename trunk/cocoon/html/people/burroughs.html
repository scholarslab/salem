        <p>The story of the Rev. George Burroughs is important because of its 
          differences from the other accusations. Burroughs was one of the few 
          men executed during the trails, and he was the only clergyman accused 
          of witchcraft. He has often been portrayed in popular accounts of the 
          trials, because some of his accusers claimed him to be the "ring leader" 
          of the witches and because of the especially dramatic nature of his 
          execution in the presence of the Rev. Cotton Mather.<br>
          <br>
          George Burroughs was born to a rather well to do family in Suffolk, 
          England in about 1652. At a young age he left England for Massachusetts 
          By Colony and was raised by his mother in the town of Roxbury. He later 
          attended Harvard College and graduated in 1670. After graduating, he 
          moved to Maine and started preaching in Falmouth (Portland, Maine) until 
          the town was attacked by Indians in 1676 forcing him to leave. He was 
          a minister in Salisbury for a few years and eventually in 1680 was called 
          to Salem Village to be the new minister.<br>
          <br>
          The issues leading up to his accusation as a witch are rooted in the 
          events that happened in his two-year stay in Salem Village. One of the 
          major complaints seems to have been Burroughs' unconventional religious 
          beliefs. In the book <i>Salem Story</i>, Bernard Rosenthal, stresses 
          the significance of the fact that the Rev. Increase Mather and his son 
          Cotton Mather, both prominent ministers in Boston, did not agree with 
          Burroughs' religious convictions. Rosenthal suggests Cotton Mather may 
          have suspected him of being a Baptist. When on trial questions put forward 
          to Burroughs dealt with his religious practices, especially the baptism 
          of his children and his lack of attendance at the Lord's Supper, in 
          an attempt to expose his deviance from Puritan doctrines.<br>
          <br>
          Burroughs, as minister of the Salem Town in 1680-1683, also became involved 
          in village quarrels. In once instance, Thomas Putnam lent Burroughs 
          some money, and when he was unable to pay the money back, the town reacted 
          strongly and he was pushed out of Salem. In 1683 he returned to Maine.<br>
          <br>
          On April 30, 1692, Burroughs, together with several others, was accused 
          of witchcraft. The original document stating the charges was signed 
          by Thomas Putnam and Jonathan Walcott. Burroughs was charged with "high 
          suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft done or committed by then upon 
          the bodies of Mary Walcot Marcy Lewis Abigail Williams Ann Putnam and 
          Eliz. Hubbard and Susan Sheldon." On May 4, 1692, he was forcefully 
          taken from his home in Wells, Maine, to Salem, and put in jail.<br>
          <br>
          One man fueling the attacks on Burroughs was Cotton Mather. Cotton Mather 
          was at this time known for his cautionary writings on how spectral evidence 
          in the trials should be used. However, as Rosenthal suggests, in Burroughs' 
          case Mather put aside his views on the unreliability of spectral evidence, 
          further suggesting that Mather's hatred of Burroughs was based on Burroughs' 
          role as a religious dissident. <br>
          <br>
          For this reason, Burroughs can be viewed as the one person executed 
          for witchcraft for his religious beliefs. As Puritan dissenter Burroughs 
          was attacked by the Puritans and seen as harmful to their society. The 
          first question asked of Burroughs at his trail was whether his children 
          were all baptized. He said only one of them was. On August 3, 1692, 
          many testified against Burroughs. Young girls such as Elizabeth Hubbard, 
          Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon, Mary Walcott and Ann Putnam all claimed 
          that he had come to them and tried to force them to sign his book which 
          Elizabeth said was written in words "as red as blood". Mercy Lewis claimed 
          that Burroughs "carried me up to an exceeding high mountain and shewed 
          me all the kingdoms of the earth and told me that he would give them 
          all to me if I would writ in his book"(Salem Witchcraft Papers). Accused 
          witches such as Abigail Hobbs and Mary Warren charged him with bringing 
          them into the world of Satan. He was the "ring leader of them all" holding 
          the meetings in Salem and trying to force many away from God and to 
          Satan.<br>
          <br>
          Another factor working against Burroughs was the fact that his first 
          two wives had died. Ann Putnam claimed that the two wives came to her 
          as visions and told her that Burroughs had killed them and that he was 
          indeed working for the Devil. John and Rebecca Putnam claimed he was 
          "sharp with his wife".<br>
          <br>
          Burroughs was also known for his superhuman strength. Men at the trial 
          testified that they had seen him "put his fingers into the Bung Barrall 
          and lifted it up, and carried it round him and set it downe again"(SWP). 
          Others claimed that he was able to lift up a six-foot gun using one 
          hand with no difficulty. His brut strength was more proof of his allegiance 
          with the devil.<br>
          <br>
          All this testimony lead the court to conclude that Burroughs was indeed 
          a sorcerer and was in fact the leader of the witchcraft related events. 
          As Boyer and Nissenbaum seem to suggest, Burroughs was in a way used 
          as a scapegoat. By attributing to him the role of the ringleader, the 
          witchcraft problem was no longer associated with the community of Salem 
          Village but was put upon the shoulders of one man, George Burroughs. 
          <br>
          <br>
          From the actual documents, one can conclude that Burroughs was a man 
          with powerful enemies in Salem Village. The fact that he was a minister 
          did little to soften the accusations against him. The other key player 
          was Cotton Mather. Rosenthal's theory that Burroughs was a religious 
          dissenter is highly plausible. Mather was after Burroughs because he 
          believed him to be a Baptist as well as a witch.<br>
          <br>
          Burroughs' trial was the only one attended by Increase Mather. Mather 
          believed that if someone could perfectly recite the Lord's Prayer then 
          he or she was not a witch. However, as Robert Calef writes in his book 
          <i>More Wonders of the Invisible World</i> "Mr. Burroughs was carried, 
          through the streets of Salem to Execution; when he was upon the Ladder, 
          he made a Speech for the clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn 
          and Serious Expressions, as were to the Admiration of all present; his 
          Prayer (which he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well 
          worded, and uttered with such composedness, and such (at least seeming) 
          fervency of Spirit, as was very affecting, and drew Tears from many 
          ( so that is seemed to some that the Spectators would hinder the Execution)". 
          <br>
          <br>
          NathanielHawthorne describes this scene in his powerful story <i>Main 
          Street</i> and refers to Burroughs as going to a "martyr's death". Hawthorne 
          depicts Burroughs as an innocent victim of the terrible trials. He writes 
          "Who would not say, while we see him offering comfort to the weak and 
          aged partners of his horrible crime, - while we hear his ejaculations 
          of prayer, that seem to bubble up out of the depths of his heart, and 
          fly heavenward, unawares, - while we behold a radiance brightening on 
          his features as from the other world, which is but a few steps off, 
          - who would not say, that over the dusty track of the Mainstreet, a 
          Christian saint in now going to a martyr's death?" When the crowed calls 
          for the execution to be stopped Hawthorne continues "Ah no; for listen 
          to the wise Cotton Mather, who. As he sits there on his horse, speaks 
          comfortable to the perplexed multitude , and tells them that all had 
          been religiously and justly done, and that Satan's power shall this 
          day receive its death-blow in New England". Calef recorded that, "Mr. 
          Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse, addressed himself to the 
          People, partly to declare, that he [George Burroughs] was no ordained 
          minister, and partly to possess the People of his guilt; saying, That 
          the Devil has often been transformed into an Angel of Light." In doing 
          this he reassured the crowd of Burroughs' guilt and the execution proceeded.
