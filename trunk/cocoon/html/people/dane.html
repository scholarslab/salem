       <b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br>
          An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
          Spring Semester 2001</b> 
        <p>Rev. Francis Dane was born around 1615 in England and died on February 
          16, 1697 at the age of eighty-one in Andover, Massachusetts. He is the 
          son of John Dane, who settled in both Ipswich and Roxbury. Dane's name 
          is found among the early residents of Ipswich in 1641, and according 
          to Joseph Felt's <i>History of Ipswich</i>, Dane moved to Andover in 
          1648. Dane became the second pastor of the North Parish in 1649. He 
          remained in this position for forty-eight years until his death in 1697. 
          In regard to his education, Rev. Cotton Mather lists Dane as one of 
          the young men who finished his studies in the Colony before Harvard 
          College conferred degrees. In addition to his ministry, Dane founded 
          school for Andover youth. Dane had two sons, Nathaniel and Francis, 
          and four daughters, Elizabeth (Johnson), Hannah (Goodhue), Phebe (Robinson), 
          and Abigail (Faulkner). He himself was married three times: Elizabeth 
          Ingals (pre 1645-1676), Mary Thomas (1677-1689), and Hannah Abbot (1690-his 
          death 1697).<br>
          <br>
          Abiel Abbot's <i>History of Andover</i> notes that there is no record 
          of any discord between Dane and his congregation from 1649 to 1680, 
          although historian Sarah L. Bailey calls the reality of such a situation 
          into question in her <i>Historical Sketches of Andover</i>. Whether 
          flawless or not, it is evident that Dane was a highly respected and 
          powerful member of the Andover community, comparable only to Dudley 
          Bradstreet, former Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Around 
          1680, church members began to complain about the capabilities of Dane 
          and requested a younger, more vibrant minister for their church. In 
          January of 1682, the congregation called the young Rev. Thomas Barnard, 
          a recent graduate of Harvard and protege of Cotton Mather. Soon thereafter, 
          the congregation stopped paying Dane's salary and gave Barnard a full 
          salary. Dane petitioned the General Court in Boston, and the Andover 
          church was required to pay Dane thirty pounds a year to share pastoral 
          duties with Barnard. The church decided to pay Barnard fifty pounds 
          a year, which much less than Barnard expected, with the stipulation 
          that when Dane retired or died, Barnard would receive the full eighty 
          pounds annual salary.</p>
        <p>Andover church politics were fairly stagnate for the next ten years, 
          although it appears that the tension between Dane and Barnard was evident 
          throughout this time. In 1692, however, things started to heat up when 
          the witch hunt broke out in near by Salem Village. By August, the hunt 
          had stretched to Andover with an invitation to two of the Salem accusers 
          to come and find witches in Andover. Rev. Barnard did much to facilitate 
          the witch hunt, holding prayer meetings in the church that resulted 
          in "touch tests" where the accusers could simply touch community members 
          who were then accused of witchery. Rev. Dane refused to take part in 
          the witch hunt from the outset, and perhaps because of this as well 
          as the tension between Dane, Bradstreet, and Barnard, more members of 
          Dane's family were accused than any other single family in the entire 
          episode. In addition to Dane's extended family, two of Dane's daughters, 
          his daughter in law, and five of his grandchildren were accused.<br>
          <br>
          Upham writes, "The Rev. Francis Dane deserves to be recognized preeminent 
          and for a time almost alone in bold denunciation and courageous resistance 
          of the expiable proceedings of that dark day." Dane was the driving 
          force behind ending the trials in Andover. He first arranged for the 
          Andover children to be let out of jail on bond in October 1692. Husbands, 
          brothers, and fathers of the accused witches then joined Dane in petitioning 
          the General Court for the release of the Andover women on the grounds 
          that they were needed at home and with the coming of winter would not 
          fare well in the prisons. On October 18, 1692, Dane wrote a petition 
          addressing what he believed to be the forced and false confessions of 
          guilt made by women during the frenzy of the "touch test," in order 
          to save themselves from trial and possible execution. Dane writes that 
          there was, "reason to think that the extreme urgency that was used with 
          some of them by their friends and others who privately examined them, 
          and the fear they were then under, hath been an inducement to them to 
          admit such things." This was the first attempt to explain the confessions 
          of those who had been accused. Dane also wrote letters to the courts 
          and his fellow ministers condemning spectral evidence using such strong 
          language as, "I believe the reports have been scandalous and unjust, 
          neither will bear y light." Slander charges filed by Dane and members 
          of his family, particularly Abigail Dane Faulkner, did much to deter 
          a resurgence of accusations in Andover as well. <br>
          <br>
          Local historian Enders Robinson in his book <i>Salem Witchcraft</i> 
          concluded from the above facts that the Andover incident was a direct 
          conspiracy of Barnard against Dane. Although this theory cannot be proven, 
          and Dane was responsible for halting the Andover proceedings, Robinson 
          makes an unfounded assumption. Barnard was highly respected and had 
          studied with Cotton Mather at Harvard. Mather was one of the top proponents 
          of the trials and the necessity of purging the colony of witches. Barnard 
          was not the only minister at the time to be lured to Mather's convincing 
          theological arguments. In Barnard's mind, promoting the witch trials 
          could very well have been the best thing he could do for his congregation. 
          One must also note that as Dane's resistance movement gained momentum, 
          Barnard sided with Dane over the courts. Robinson believes this to be 
          indicative of Barnard's manipulative nature. Although this is possible, 
          there is no evidence for Barnard's motive in changing sides on the witchcraft 
          issue. Regardless of the social motives behind what occurred in Andover 
          in 1692, Dane immerged as a fearless and effective leader. He suffered 
          under the accusations of numerous members of his family, yet found the 
          strength to guide an entire community through an irrationality that 
          could have lead to many more innocent deaths had he not taken such an 
          outspoken, controversial, and admirable stand. </p>
