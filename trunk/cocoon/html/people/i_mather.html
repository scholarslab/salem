        <p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <br>
          An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
          Spring Semester 2001</b> </p>
        <p>Increase Mather was born on June 21, 1639 to Richard and Katherine 
          Mather. He and four of his five brothers would follow Richard's call 
          to guide the morality and spirituality of their fellow man, even as 
          the family ventured with other Puritans to New England in the seventeenth 
          century. There the Mathers settled, as Richard took up his ministry 
          in Dorchester just south of Boston.</p>
        <p>Increase graduated from Harvard College in 1656, an institution to 
          which he would return as its President. His son, Cotton Mather was born 
          into the third generation of Puritan Mather ministers, and after following 
          in father's footsteps by studying at Harvard, Cotton would join his 
          father as a leader in the Boston religious establishment. </p>
        <p>In February 1674, Increase Mather delivered a sermon, entitled "The 
          Day of Trouble is Near", the first of many great speeches to the faithful 
          that would make him an influential Puritan leader in Boston and across 
          the growing Massachusetts Bay Colony. By 1680-1681, Increase Mather 
          had "established himself as the conservative champion of the New England 
          church." His predominant role in Puritan society would call him across 
          the ocean, as turbulent events in England led to the revocation of the 
          Massachusetts Bay Colony's charter. Between 1688 and 1692, Increase 
          Mather was in England advocating on behalf of the colony.</p>
        <p>Mather returned to New England on May 14, 1692 with not simply a new 
          charter, but also a new Governor, Sir William Phips. Increase Mather 
          played a crucial role in securing Phips' appointment by the Crown, and 
          therefore the Governor was indebted to him for his position.</p>
        <p>When Mather and Phips arrived in Boston, events in Salem Village had 
          already begun to swirl beyond the confines of that small community. 
          The jails were beginning to fill with the accused witches, and interim 
          Governor Bradstreet had kept courts from sitting in trial. The new Governor, 
          empowered by a new charter, looked to clear the judicial backlog and 
          established the special Court of Oyer and Terminer to "hear and determine" 
          the witchcraft cases. On May 27, 1692 the Court was established, and 
          Bridget Bishop was the first to be executed on Gallows Hill in Salem 
          exactly two weeks later on June 10.</p>
        <p>Governor Phips, apparently surprised at the speed and force which his 
          actions had begun to unleash, looked to Increase Mather and other notable 
          Boston ministers for guidance. Increase signed onto "The Return of Several 
          Ministers," written by his son, Cotton Mather, which put the Boston 
          ministers on record urging caution in the use of spectral evidence in 
          the Salem court. Pre-occupied with preparations for an expedition to 
          fight Indian forces in Maine, Phips did not pay sufficient attention 
          to the mounting number of arrests and executions ordered by the Salem 
          court, before he left Boston for Maine in mid-August 1692. With Phips 
          went Increase Mather's highest patron in civil government and any hopes 
          he might have had of restraining the court in Salem.</p>
        <p>As June stretched into July, the pace of arrests, examinations, and 
          imprisonments only quickened leading to the execution of five women 
          on July 19. On July 31, Increase delivered a sermon at Simon Willard's 
          Third Church in Boston in which he posed the question to the congregation: 
          "O what makes the difference between the devils in hell and the angels 
          of heaven?" Mather answered that the quality of holiness distinguished 
          an angel in heaven from the devils below, and in doing so he "focused 
          responsibility on the people of New England at large, and yet looked 
          to individuals for the means to solve the problem. It encouraged the 
          individual believer to attend to the state of his or her own soul regardless 
          of what might be happening in the world." (Peterson, 93). The impact 
          of such words from a Boston pulpit on views of the witchcraft problem 
          is indirect, but clear nonetheless. Mather advised the congregation 
          that they should focus their attention on their own shortcomings and 
          not those that they saw in their neighbors and friends. Still, this 
          was not a clear message to halt the trials, and they continued unabated 
          in Salem. </p>
        <p>Increase Mather attended only one trial in Salem, that of George Burroughs, 
          Jr., and he seems to have fully agreed with the result. Bernard Rosenthal 
          in his <i>Salem Story</i> focuses attention on the seeming contradiction 
          between Increase Mather's overall opposition to the Court's methods 
          and his support for the same methods in the case of Mr. Burroughs. Rosenthal 
          writes that, "Burroughs, as a dissenting minister, offered so powerful 
          a symbol of lost Puritan power that such moderate and influential ministers 
          as Increase and Cotton Mather lost their way in confronting his case." 
          Contradictions such as this continue to haunt comments on Mather by 
          scholars of the period. </p>
        <p>By late September 1692, the witchcraft trials had truly reached an 
          hysterical pitch. Nineteen had been hanged, and Giles Cory had been 
          tortured to death for refusing to enter a plea. Scores of people languished 
          in the jails awaiting trial on the charges against them.</p>
        <p>In <i>Cases of Conscience</i> Increase Mather forcefully related his 
          distrust of spectral evidence to convict witches. He argued that it 
          would be better that ten witches go free than the blood of a single 
          innocent be shed. One Mather biographer wrote that, "No zeal to stamp 
          out crimes ever drove him from his belief that, whatever the fate of 
          the guilty, the innocent must never be in peril." His strong words of 
          disapproval for spectral evidence so prominently used by the Court of 
          Oyer and Terminer ended the trials after the directive from Governor 
          Phips at the end of October, recently returned from his expedition in 
          Maine.</p>
        <p><i>Cases of Conscience,</i> however, is not without its flaws, the 
          chief one being Mather's attempt to absolve the judges of Salem of any 
          wrongdoing and to praise them for their work. Bernard Rosenthal writes 
          that, "Indeed, when the witch trials ended, he damned the prosecution 
          and justified the prosecutors." Perry Miller, more forcefully, writes 
          that "Without the postscript, <i>Cases of Conscience</i> would be a 
          bold stroke; with it, the book is a miserable species of double-talk." 
          Kenneth Murdock offers a more balanced approach when he writes of Mather's 
          postscript, "Less could hardly be said in fairness. More approval of 
          the trials Mather never expressed." </p>
        <p>Increase Mather has been criticized for his delay in putting his considerable 
          moral authority against the trials, but it would seem that from his 
          endorsement of "The Return of the Ministers" through his own <i>Cases 
          of Conscience,</i> Mather was continually seeking to lend caution to 
          the hysteria without undermining the tenuous framework of the Puritan 
          government in Boston and Salem. Others have criticized Mather for his 
          seeming duplicity, in excoriating the trials in general but supporting 
          that of Burroughs or in deriding the conduct of the Court but praising 
          its overseers. It is important to note, as many have done, that Increase 
          Mather very much believed in the evils and dangers of witchcraft and 
          had no doubt that if the handiwork of the devil was proven, a Puritan 
          society should "suffer no witch to live." Mather may very well have 
          thought George Burroughs was a witch and been satisfied to hear of his 
          hanging in August 1692. He likely admired to some degree the tenacity 
          with which the Court of Oyer and Terminer took to the task of defending 
          the covenanted community of the Massachusetts Bay from the devil.</p>
        <p>Increase Mather, however, understood that innocent blood was being 
          shed, and that the Salem court ran rampant without concern for the advice 
          of the clerical guides, an unprecedented development in the Puritan 
          Colony. In the witchcraft trials that grew out of the supposed afflictions 
          of young girls in Salem Village, Mather may also have seen the symptoms 
          of a fundamentally changing Puritan world. He was caught in the middle 
          of it, along with the rest of New England, and no doubt agreed with 
          his friend Thomas Brattle that, "ages will not wear off that reproach 
          and those stains which these things will leave behind them upon our 
          land." </p>
