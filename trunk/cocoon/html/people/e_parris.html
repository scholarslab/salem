        <p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <br>
          An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
          Spring Semester 2001</b> </p>
        <p>Elizabeth (Betty) Parris was nine years old when the witchcraft epidemic 
          broke out in Salem, and she actively participated in its beginning. 
          Elizabeth, a sweet girl, had difficulty facing the stark realities of 
          predestination and damnation that her father, Reverend Samuel Parris, 
          preached to her. Elizabeth Parris lived in a period of economic uncertainty 
          and yearned to know what lay in her future. </p>
        <p>In the dark winter days of 1691, Elizabeth Parris and her cousin Abigail 
          Williams began to undertake experiments in fortune telling, using a 
          device known as a "venus glass." A venus glass consists of an egg white 
          suspended in water in which one could see shapes and figures. The girls 
          mainly focused on their future social status, and specifically on the 
          trade in which their husbands would be employed. These fortune telling 
          secrets were shared with other young girls in the area. On one occasion, 
          the glass revealed the horrendous specter of a coffin, which, as Rev. 
          John Hale reported in <i>A Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft</i>, 
          (1702) led to "diabolical molestation.". And it is out of these childish 
          beginnings that the Salem witchcraft outbreak began.</p>
        <p>Betty Parris' afflictions started innocently in January when she began 
          to forget errands, was unable to concentrate, and seemed rapt in secret 
          preoccupation. She could not concentrate at prayer time and barked like 
          a dog when her father would rebuke her. She screamed wildly when she 
          heard the "Our Father" prayer and once hurled a Bible across the room. 
          After these episodes, she sobbed distractedly and spoke of being damned. 
          She seemed to see damnation as inevitable, perhaps because of her practicing 
          fortune telling, which was regarded as a demonic activity.. Reverend 
          Samuel Parris believed that prayer could cure her odd behavior, but 
          his efforts were ineffective.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows precisely what the Betty Parris and her girls friends 
          were experiencing, but it manifested itself as odd postures, foolish 
          and ridiculous speech, distempers, and fits. John Hale in <i>A Modest 
          Inquiry</i> described the affliction that the girls suffered by saying 
          they looked as if they "were bitten and pinched by invisible agents; 
          their arms, necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned 
          back again, so as it was impossible for them to do of themselves, and 
          beyond the power of Epileptick fits, or natural disease to effect. Sometimes 
          they were taken dumb, their mouths stopped, their throats choked, their 
          limbs wracked and tormented so as might move a heart of stone to sympathize 
          with them." The local physician, William Griggs, diagnosed Elizabeth 
          Parris as being afflicted by the "Evil Hand," commonly known as witchcraft. 
          Rev. Samuel Parris thought it was "a very sore rebuke and humbling providence 
          that the Lord ordered the horrid calamity to break out first in [his] 
          family." Since the sufferers of witchcraft were believed to be the victims 
          of a crime, the community set out to find the perpetrators.</p>
        <p>On February 29, 1692, under intense adult questioning, the afflicted 
          girls named Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba as their tormentors. 
          Elizabeth Parris testified at these trials that she was tormented by 
          spectral visions of these women. During their trials, Elizabeth would 
          cry out when the accused moved her arms, legs, or head, as if the accused 
          was injuring her from across the room. Elizabeth Parris was also involved 
          in the conviction of Martha Corey. At Martha Corey's trial, the afflicted 
          girls sat together, and what Martha did, they all did. If she shifted 
          her feet they did so too, and fell to stamping their feet. If she bit 
          her lips, they yelled that she had bitten theirs, and showed the magistrates 
          tht they bled." . </p>
        <p>Understandably, Mrs. Parris was worried about the health of her daughter 
          and she protested against using her as a witch finder. At the end of 
          March, Betty was sent to live with Rev. Samuel Parris' distant cousin, 
          Stephen Sewall, in Salem. This technique of isolation stopped most of 
          her symptoms, but she still had visions after leaving the Parris household. 
          On March 25, Elizabeth "related that the great Black Man came to her, 
          and told her, if she would be ruled by him, she should have whatsoever 
          she desired, and go to a Golden City" (Lawson). Mrs. Sewall told Elizabeth 
          that it had been the Devil who had approached her "and he was a Lyar 
          from the Beginning, and bid her tell him so, if he came again: which 
          she did" (Lawson). </p>
        <p>In 1710, Elizabeth Parris finally found the answer to the question 
          she had been searching for in her homemade crystal ball. She married 
          Benjamin Baron, a yeoman, trader, cordwainer, and shoemaker, in Sudbury 
          and led a very ordinary existence. She and Benjamin bore four children, 
          Thomas, Elizabeth Jr., Catherine, and Susanna. Elizabeth Parris survived 
          her husband by six years, succumbing to illness in their Concord home 
          on March 21, 1760 (Marilyn Roach).</p>
