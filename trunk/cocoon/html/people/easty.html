        <p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <br>
          An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
          Spring Semester 2001</b>
		        
        <p>Considering the assumption that witchcraft was hereditary, Mary (Towne) 
          Easty was certain to be accused of witchcraft after her sister, Rebecca 
          (Towne) Nurse, was condemned for her unwavering appeal of innocence. 
          Mary Easty was not a member of Salem Town or Village, but a resident 
          of Topsfield, a settlement just north of the Village. Animosity had 
          festered between members of Salem Village and Topsfield since 1639 when 
          the General Court of Massachusetts granted Salem permission to expand 
          northward in the direction of the Ipswich River, but then only four 
          years later the same court authorized inhabitants of another Village, 
          Ipswich, to found a settlement there. As land became scarcer, quarrels 
          regarding boundaries between the settlement to become known as Topsfield 
          and Salem went on for a century. The Putnams of Salem Village embodied 
          this battle in their quarrels with the Nurse family, Mary Easty's brother-in-law. 
          According to Boyer and Nissenbaum in <i>Salem Possessed</i>, considering 
          the bitterness between these families, it can be seen as no coincidence 
          that the three Towne sisters, Rebecca Nurse, Sarah Cloyce and Mary Easty, 
          were all daughters and wives of Topsfield men eventually to be persecuted 
          by Putnam women in 1692 on behalf of Putnam men.<br>
          <br>
          More interesting than the accusations against Easty is her experience 
          during the trials. She was accused on April 21, examined on the 22nd, 
          and imprisoned after denying her guilt. During her examination, Magistrate 
          John Hathorne aggressively questioned Easty, or more accurately, tried 
          to lead her to a confession by the following line of questioning: <br>
          <br>
          "How can you say you know nothing when you see these tormented [girls], 
          & accuse you that you know nothing?" "Would you have me accuse myself?" 
          <br>
          "Yes if you be guilty." <br>
          "Sir, I never complied but prayed against [the devil] all my dayes... 
          I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this sin." (SWPI 
          120)<br>
          <br>
          In a surprising moment, Hathorne, clearly affected by the convincing 
          manner with which Easty spoke, turned to the accusers and asked, "Are 
          you certain this is the woman?" This question acted as a symbol for 
          the accusers to release their full energy into tormented fits. Hathorne 
          was now convinced and imprisoned Easty. The girls, however, seemed not 
          to be fully convinced of their own accusations. Perhaps due to pressure 
          from community around Easty, all of the accusers, except Mercy Lewis, 
          began to back off their claims and Easty was released from jail on May 
          18.<br>
          <br>
          The details of what happened next provide undeniable clues about the 
          power of the accusers and the impossibility of conducting a fair juridical 
          process. After Easty's release, Mercy Lewis fell into violent fits and 
          appeared to be approaching death. Mercy Lewis later explained that Easty 
          was tormenting her, and "said [Easty] would kill [Lewis] before midnight 
          because she did not cleare hir so as the Rest did." (Salem Witchcraft 
          Papers, I: 124) Mary Walcott, Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam were brought 
          to her bedside in an effort to discover who was tormenting Mercy. Along 
          the path to the Mercy's house, Ann and Abigail explained that they saw 
          Easty's specter tormenting Mercy, strongly suggesting a collaboration 
          effort had already taken place before Mercy began her torments. Frances 
          Hill in <i>A Delusion of Satan</i> calls this episode a propaganda scheme 
          to show doubting Villagers the dire consequences of freeing witches 
          from jail. Mercy and four others cried out against Easty on May 20. 
          Mercy's fits did not cease until Easty was back in prison in irons demonstrating 
          the effective power of the accusers. <br>
          <br>
          While Easty remained in jail awaiting her September 9 trial, she and 
          her sister, Sarah Cloyce, composed a petition to the magistrates in 
          which they asked, in essence, for a fair trial. They complained that 
          they were "neither able to plead our owne cause, nor is councell allowed." 
          They suggested that the judges ought to serve as their counsel and that 
          they be allowed persons to testify on their behalf. Easty hoped her 
          good reputation in Topsfield and the words of her minister might aid 
          her case in Salem, a town of strangers. Lastly, the sisters asked that 
          the testimony of accusers and other "witches" be dismissed considering 
          it was predominantly spectral evidence that lacked legality. (Salem 
          Witchcraft Papers, I: 303) The sisters hoped that the judges would be 
          forced to weigh solid character testimony against ambiguous spectral 
          evidence. The petition did not change the outcome of Easty's trial, 
          for she was condemned to hang on September 17th. But together with her 
          second petition, Easty had forced the court to consider its flaws.<br>
          <br>
          Easty's second petition was written not as a last attempt to save her 
          own life but as a plea that "no more innocent blood may be shed." (SWP 
          I :304) She concedes saying that the court had the best of intentions, 
          but only more innocent deaths would occur if the court continued its 
          practices, for she like many others could not "belie [their] own soul." 
          She proposes two strategies for the court in to use when determining 
          witchcraft: First, she asks that the accusers be kept apart to see if 
          under such circumstances they would all tell the same experiences. If 
          they were able to give similar credible accounts of their spectral experiences 
          then any doubt would be removed as to the guilt or innocence of the 
          person on trial. This proposal brings to mind Thomas Brattle's observation 
          in his famous <i>Letter</i> of October 8, 1692 that the accusers, when 
          not claiming to be attacked by specters, were otherwise in good health. 
          Easty was obviously not the only skeptic of the accusers' spectral torments. 
          Secondly, Easty proposed that all confessing witches be brought to trial 
          as well as those confessing innocence. Rosenthal writes in <i>A Salem 
          Story</i> that in an atmosphere of rising doubt, "for the court to ignore 
          Easty's challenge would be to acknowledge to the critics that the proceedings 
          were fatally flawed - that the hunt was not really for witches after 
          all but for validating the court." <br>
          <br>
          Easty was hanged on September 22, 1692. Her demeanor at Gallows Hill 
          is documented by Calef: "when she took her last farewell of her husband, 
          children and friends, was, as is reported by them present, as serious, 
          religious, distinct, and affectionate as could well be exprest, drawing 
          tears from the eyes of almost all present." Easty challenged the court 
          to no personal avail, but she exposed the weakness of the court for 
          the benefit of others. <br>
