<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<font size=
"+1"><br /></font> Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Although eighteen year-old Mary Walcott was not the most
notorious of the accusers, her role in the Salem witch trials was
by no means minimal. She was one of the original girls to be
afflicted; and it was her aunt, Mary Sibley, who decided to try
some white magic to fend off the evil powers in the village. It was
Sibley's idea to persuade Tituba and John Indian, slaves of the
Rev. Samuel Parris, to make the "witch cake" to discover witches
that resulted in Betty Parris and Abigail Williams making their
first accusations.</p>
<p>Walcott's mother died when she was young and her father, Joseph
Walcott, Captain of the Salem Village militia, married Deliverance
Putnam thus making him the brother-in-law of Thomas Putnam, one of
the most powerful men in the village. The family alliance made Mary
Walcott the niece of Thomas Putnam and cousin of his twelve
year-old daughter Ann Putnam, Jr., a household that also included
Mercy Lewis, an orphaned servant girl, who, with Ann Putnam, Jr.,
became one of the most active accusers.</p>
<p>Mary Walcott was not an aggressive accuser. In her book, <i>The
Devil in Massachusetts,</i> Marion Starkey describes Walcott as "a
girl who could take possession calmly. Mary Walcott was to sit
placidly knitting through a Dionysiac frenzy on the part of her
companions." During the examination of Sarah Cloyce, Mary Walcott
was calm. "She had brought her knitting with her, and became so
intent on it that she clicked her needles no matter what devils
rioted about her. Every so often she glanced up to confirm someone
else's story" (Starkey 82). Walcott was always a passive accuser
but she was occasionally afflicted with the more physical
manifestations of witchcraft. When Mary Clarke, who had been
accused by Mary Post on August 4, was obstinate in giving her
confession, what Rosenthal describes as a "flurry of pins" ensued.
Mary Warren appeared in court with one stuck one in her throat, and
Susannah Sheldon had four in her hand and even the quiet Mary
Walcott had one pin in her arm. When former minister of Salem
Village, Deodat Lawson, returned to preach in Salem Village, he
encountered Walcott at the tavern of Nathaniel Ingersoll. "Lawson
by candlelight examined a mysterious set of teeth marks on the arm
of one of the troubled girls, seventeen-year-old Mary Walcott."</p>
<p>In <i>Salem Story,</i> Bernard Rosenthal refers to Walcott as
"an old standby" and one of the "regulars," a title he reserves for
Ann Putnam, Sr., Elizabeth Hubbard, Mercy Lewis, Abigail Williams,
Betty Parris, and Ann Putnam, Jr. Although she lacked the
melodramatic behavior of her fellow accusers, Walcott is an
interesting example in support of Carol Karlsen's theory. In her
book <i>The Devil in the Shape of a Woman,</i> Karlsen suggests
that many of these girls, being either orphaned or partially
orphaned, feared for their social and economic security. Walcott
allied herself with the interests of the influential Putnam family
in Salem Village. An alliance with such a powerful dynasty ensured
economic viability for the uncertain future she faced. Mary Walcott
is an example of how teenage anxiety about the future could
manifest itself in the form of socially destructive behavior.</p>
