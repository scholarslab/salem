        <div align="left"><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature <br>
          </b> <b>An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br>
          Spring Semester 2001</b> </div>
        <p>On August 5, 1641, John Hathorne was born into a community that could 
          have little suspected his future role in the condemnation and death 
          of so many people. His prominent ancestry in Salem led him to acquire 
          positions of justice of the peace and county judge. As a religious man 
          in a highly religious community, Hathorne, like others, believed that 
          the devil had the power to influence people to do harm in the community 
          and in the church. Hathorne allowed his strong, unexamined, beliefs 
          to influence him during his time as judge in the Salem Witchcraft Trials, 
          thus making him take on an avid prosecutorial style and an assumption 
          of guilt of most of those who answered his questions. </p>
        <p>Usually, Hathorne began his questioning in an accusatory tone, and 
          he would then proceed to badger the accused in an attempt to drive out 
          a confession and, better yet, more accusations. Although these methods 
          were a departure from tradition, Hathorne used them throughout the trials. 
          One classic example of Hathorne at work as a judge is the examination 
          of Rebecca Nurse. He begins not by asking Nurse if she is guilty or 
          innocent, but by asking the afflicted if Nurse afflicts them. He then 
          asks Rebecca, "here are two An: Putman the child & Abigail Williams 
          complains of your hurting them What do you say to it" and Nurse replies 
          that she is innocent." Hathorne, of course, does not let it rest at 
          that. He continues, "Here is never a one in the Assembly but desires 
          it, but if you be guilty Pray God discover you" and then allows the 
          people in the room to stand and testify as to how Nurse afflicted each 
          of them, relentlessly asking Rebecca after each how and if she denies 
          them. He persists, asking, "You see these accuse you, is it true?" in 
          response to which Nurse states "No," but, not being the answer that 
          Hathorne desired he asks again, "Are you an innocent person relating 
          to this Witchcraft." Hathorne then continued to allow the accusations 
          of others to be heard until Rebecca Nurse cried, "Oh Lord help me, & 
          spread out her hands, & the afflicted were grievously vexed" to which 
          Hathorne replies in his usual accusatory manner, "Do you not see what 
          a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are loose the persons 
          are afflicted." Frustrated by her continued claim of innocence, Hathorne 
          states, "It is very awful to all to see these agonies & you an old Professor 
          [believer] thus charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects 
          of it & yet to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet" 
          to which Rebecca Nurse courageously asserts "You do not know my heart." 
          It is here that Hathorne slips in his composure and openly states, "You 
          would do well if you are guilty to confess & give Glory to God" - thus 
          showing his already formed opinion as to her guilt and his preference 
          for confessions. The questioning then continues and Hathorne switches 
          into a new mode and attempts to trick Nurse into confessing, "Possibly 
          you [Nurse] may apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led 
          aside by temptations that way" for, if Nurse confessed to either, she 
          would be confessing at least to the practice of witchcraft still, and 
          could still be punished. Again the badgering by Hathorne continued until 
          finally Nurse asked a revealing question to which she received no answer, 
          "Would you [Hathorne] have me belie my self." This questioned posed 
          to Hathorne shows that Nurse suspected that Hathorne desired her to 
          confess even though she was innocent, and her brave questioning of him 
          ended the examination.</p>
        <p>Hathorne's role in the trials leaves room for questioning his motives 
          for participating. Prior to Governor Phip's arrival in Massachusetts, 
          both Hathorne and Corwin had actively jailed many who were suspected 
          of witchcraft, thus setting the scene for each man to be biased toward 
          the guilt of those accused. Hathorne also appeared strangely calm while 
          questioning those accused of acting in the devil's name. Even Bridget 
          Bishop wondered why he did not fear that she would harm him if she was 
          a witch: Hathorne: How can you [Bridget Bishop] know, you are no Witch, 
          & yet not know what a Witch is. Bridget Bishop: I am clear: if I were 
          any such person you should know it. (SWP I: 84, emphasis added) </p>
        <p>If Hathorne believed that God protected him or if he knew that those 
          he questioned could be innocent cannot be proven either way. Bernard 
          Rosenthal suggests in Salem Story the possibility that Hathorne might 
          have also stood to have some financial gain from the trials from the 
          seizure of property that took place, and the same with the other judges. 
          Whatever his motives for such aggressive prosecution, however, Hathorne 
          put many innocent people to death and became the shame of his family 
          even down to his great-grandson, Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>
