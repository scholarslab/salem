        Bridget Bishop has developed into a colorful character in the legendary 
        history of Salem Village. As the first woman tried and executed as a witch 
        during the Salem witchcraft trials, she has attracted a lot of imaginative 
        speculation about her character and behavior. <br>
        <br>
        The Bridget Bishop that is most commonly portrayed is one who kept a house 
        of refreshment for travelers, and a shuffle board for the entertainment 
        of her guests. She generally seemed to have exhibited certain behaviors 
        and appearances that exposed her to some scandal. She wore a showy costume 
        for the austere Puritan times -- a red bodice. Her freedom from the severity 
        of Puritan manners and disregard of conventional decorum in her conversation 
        and conduct brought her into disrepute, so the tongue of gossip was generally 
        loosened against her. She is portrayed as a folk heroine in Salem's story. 
        A spirited, feisty, buxom, and lusty woman who flaunted Puritan morals 
        with a happy public house where drinking and gambling occurred. Many say 
        that it was her flashy taste in dress, her smooth and flattering manner 
        with men, and the questionable gaieties that had gone on in her two taverns, 
        which led to people gossiping about her as a witch as far back as King 
        Philips War. <br>
        <br>
        This, however, is not the same Bridget Bishop of history. Research done 
        by historian David Green indicates that scholars and writers have confused 
        Bridget Bishop of Salem with Sarah Bishop, a tavern keeper in Salem Village. 
        Bridget Bishop lived on a small piece of property in Salem Town and was 
        between fifty-five and sixty-five in 1692, when she was accused of witchcraft. 
        The account below follows the more historically accurate description of 
        Bridget Bishop's life, taken from Bernard Rosenthal's book Salem Story. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1666, the widow Bridget Wasselbe married Thomas Oliver and had a daughter 
        named Christian. This marriage was less than idyllic. In 1678, Bridget 
        was accused of calling her husband names on the Sabbath, and both she 
        and her husband were sentenced to stand gagged in the market place for 
        their offenses. In January 1679, Bridget and Thomas were both sentenced 
        to be whipped for fighting. It was not unusual for Bridget's face to be 
        battered during her marriage to Thomas Oliver. In 1680, she was accused 
        of witchcraft. This accusation could have been facilitated by Thomas' 
        claim that "she was a bad wife . . .the devil had come bodily to her . 
        . . and she sat up all night with the devil." (Charles Upham, Salem Witchcraft). 
        This accusation occurred after her husband died without leaving a will, 
        and seems to be the classic case of a vulnerable, propertied woman being 
        accused of witchcraft. She posted bond, and there is no record of any 
        punishment. In 1687, she was charged with stealing brass objects. Her 
        record then remains clean until she is brought up on witchcraft charges 
        again in April 1692. <br>
        <br>
        On April 19, 1692 at her examination, Bridget Bishop began her testimony 
        with courtesy and deference. This deferential attitude soon gave way to 
        anger as she realized that denying her involvement was not an effective 
        strategy. The afflicted girls were in the courtroom swooning in response 
        to the imagined spectral advances of Bridget Bishop. Magistrate John Hawthorne 
        unleashed his loaded questions, asking, "How is it that your specter hurts 
        those in this room?" Bridget replied, "I am innocent to a witch. I know 
        not what a witch is." Hawthorne turned this answer to his advantage by 
        asking, "How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch 
        is." She replied, "I am clear: if I were any such person you should know 
        it." Although it is not clear what Bridget meant by this comment, Hawthorne 
        clearly took it as a veiled threat and replied, "You may threaten, but 
        you may do no more than you are permitted" (Salem Witchcraft papers). 
        No one can know for certain if this bold interchange earned Bridget Bishop 
        the distinction of being the first hanged on the gallows.<br>
        <br>
        On May 27, Phips established a special court of Oyer and Terminer to try 
        those accused of witchcraft. On June 2, Bridget Bishop was the first person 
        tried in the new court, perhaps because her previous witchcraft accusation 
        made her a likely candidate. In her trial, spectral evidence was given 
        an unprecedented status. She was charged with "tortur[ing], afflict[ing], 
        pin[ing], consum[ing], wast[ing]: & torment[ing] her victims," Abigail 
        Williams, Ann Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Elizabeth Hubbard. 
        Bridget vehemently denied the charges at her trial, believing that to 
        be the only way to avoid execution. She did not realize that her only 
        hope lay in confessing to witchcraft. When Cotton Mather wrote of the 
        evidence against her in his book Wonders of the Invisible World, he included 
        preposterous stories that could best be called gossip. One such story 
        recounts that Bishop cast a glance upon Salem meeting house, while walking 
        under guard. This "look" caused a board, which had been fastened with 
        nails, to be removed to another portion of the house. Her case served 
        as a model for future cases to come, following a very predictable pattern. 
        The "afflicted" persons made their accusations, which were denied by the 
        accused; members of the community told of past acts of witchcraft by the 
        accused; and one or more confessors validated the claim of the accusers. 
        The court used spectral evidence as the primary legal basis to convict 
        Bridget Bishop. Hanged on June 10, her death warrant emphasizes only the 
        harm done to her accusers, primarily on the day of her examination, as 
        the legal justification for the execution.<br>
        <br>
        "On June 10, 1692, High Sheriff George Corwin took [Bridget Bishop] to 
        the top of Gallows Hill and hanged her alone from the branches of a great 
        oak tree. Now the honest men of Salem could sleep in peace, sure that 
        the Shape of Bridget would trouble them no more" (Upham). Bridget Bishop 
        was the first person to be hanged as a result of the infamous Salem witchcraft 
        trials. </td>
