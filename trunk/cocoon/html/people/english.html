          </font>Spring Semester 2001</b> 
        <p>Philip English is an interesting figure in the Salem witch trials because 
          his prominence in the community raises questions about the pattern of 
          accusations; his escape from jail and the gallows provides insight about 
          the politics behind the trials; and his post-trials experience highlights 
          how the Colony attempted to rectify the fiscal wrongs committed against 
          the victims of the trials.<br>
          <br>
          A warrant was issued for English's arrest on April 30 1692, but he was 
          nowhere to be found, and another warrant had to be issued on May 6. 
          His wife, Mary, had been taken into custody one week earlier. Facing 
          indictments from Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon and William Beale, in 
          late May, Philip finally surfaced from hiding and joined his wife in 
          John Arnold's jail in Boston, perhaps because his avoidance of the law 
          was hurting their legal situation. Philip and Mary stayed in Boston 
          for nine weeks under lenient supervision until the eve of their expected 
          return to their August trial in Salem. But instead of returning, the 
          couple escaped to New York where they stayed throughout the duration 
          of the trials. Men of prominence including Rev. Joshua Moody of Boston, 
          Governor Phips of Massachusetts and Governor Fletcher of New York apparently 
          aided the Englishs' escape into safe hands. New York was a predominantly 
          Dutch settlement, and it was known for its religious tolerance and disapproval 
          of the proceedings in Salem.<br>
          <br>
          After Governor Phips officially ended the trials in May 1693, Philip 
          English returned to Salem with his wife in good spirits. But he soon 
          became disheartened by the pillaging of his wealthy estate at the hands 
          of Sheriff Corwin and the death of his wife Mary by consumption during 
          childbirth a year later. English fought through several petitions for 
          restitution of his estate (which in 1692 included 14 buildings, 21 sail 
          vessels, a wharf, and a warehouse). He estimated damages of 1,183 pounds 
          of which he was only awarded 60 during his lifetime and another 200 
          at his death. The legality of such land and estate seizures is complex, 
          but it remains that several authorities including Phips, English's ally, 
          knew that Essex County Sheriff George Corwin was not forwarding the 
          money to the colony or the Crown as he claimed. This brief sketch of 
          Philip English's involvement in the trial raises many questions - one 
          of course being the reason he was accused - especially considering the 
          fact that he was allowed to disappear.<br>
          <br>
          The biography of Philip English, born Philippe d'Anglois in 1651, begins 
          hazily as historians have had little luck discerning his past before 
          he came to Salem in 1670. Of French Huguenot descent, he immigrated 
          from the Isle of Jersey into the mercantile class of Salem town. From 
          this point, historians have had little trouble keeping track of him 
          because quickly upon his arrival, he established himself as a successful 
          trading merchant. His success increased when he married Mary, the only 
          daughter of William Hollingsworth, the head of a prominent shipping 
          legacy and longstanding family in Salem and Massachusetts. This brief 
          introduction sets up several characteristics that have been argued as 
          the root of English's involvement with the witch trials: 1) English 
          was an immigrant 2) with Protestant tendencies who 3) was successful 
          in the changing economy of Massachusetts. In sum, English was an outsider 
          to the community. Despite his involvement within the community on economic, 
          political and social realms, he existed as an outside threat to the 
          harmony of the Salem community. <br>
          <br>
          First, he was French, and a Huguenot at that. Bryan F. Le Beau's essay, 
          "Philip English and the witchcraft hysteria," emphasizes English's non-Puritan 
          religious background even though he and Mary attended services and baptized 
          their children at Salem's First Church. His wife was even admitted into 
          full communion in 1681. Many legends report English to have been hostile 
          towards the Puritan faith, but conflict did not arise until long after 
          the trials in 1714 when he gave money to help erect an Anglican church 
          in a nearby town. At this point tension arose as English refused to 
          pay his church taxes and as Le Beau's essay cites, he spoke out feverishly 
          against Rev Noyes, one of the Puritans ministers during the trials, 
          as having "murdered" John Proctor and Rebecca Nurse. Although English 
          later rebels against the Puritan religion, there is no documented basis 
          to believe that he his religion was an outright problem with the Puritans 
          at the time of the accusations. Nonetheless, his French Protestant descent 
          made him different and consequently vulnerable.<br>
          <br>
          English's personal character probably caused more discontent than his 
          Anglicanism. Having many land parcels in various locations made him 
          liable to frequent episodes of litigation. The lawsuit brought against 
          him by William Beale involved a heated debate about the boundaries of 
          a piece of land in Marblehead. English's open hostility against Beale 
          would come back to haunt him when Beale accused English's specter of 
          witchcraft two years later during the trials. English's consistent land 
          disputes when coupled with the town's prejudice against the superior 
          style in which his family lived exposed English to a volatile hostility. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The rich lifestyle of the English's may caused resentment among Salem 
          villagers, but more accurately, the fact that an Anglican immigrant 
          merchant could find such spectacular financial success in Salem was 
          especially disturbing. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum in <i>Salem 
          Possessed,</i> "if one had to choose the single person most representative 
          of the economic and social transformations which were overtaking Salem 
          - and Massachusetts as a whole - in the late seventeenth century, Philip 
          English might as well be that person." Boyer and Nissenbaum that claim 
          factions had arisen between Salem Village and Salem based on economic 
          and political relationship. English was incredibly successful in the 
          young mercantile industry rather than in farming, and was thus representative 
          of the new economy that many farmers perceived as a political threat 
          to the Villagers' desire for independence from Salem and its accompanying 
          social style. Infuriating the farmers, perhaps, merchants in Salem were 
          taking prominence in local politics. Philip English had been appointed 
          as a town's selectman in March of 1692 - one month before he was accused 
          of witchcraft. <br>
          <br>
          Indeed, English fits into Boyer and Nissenbaum's analysis of the witch 
          trials as an outgrowth of pre-existing tensions along economic and political 
          lines, but more broadly, English became a representative of all that 
          Salem Villagers distrusted: he lived a lavish lifestyle, he was Anglican, 
          he was an immigrant, he sympathized with other French Huguenot immigrants, 
          and he was becoming politically active. English would not be able to 
          escape the accusation, but he was able to escape the gallows. Historians 
          do know that higher political authorities such as Governor Phips was 
          an ally of English in his escape and in the restitution of his estate, 
          so perhaps his powerful allies made it futile to go after English. Since 
          I believe English was targeted as a threat to the agrarian community, 
          perhaps the stripping of his lucrative estate and his complete absence 
          from the town were sufficient to satisfy the accusers' goals. </p>
