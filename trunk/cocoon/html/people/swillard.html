        <p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<font size="+3"> </font><br>
          An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<font size="+1"><br>
          </font>Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
        <p>In evaluating those Puritan ministers involved in the Salem witch trials, 
          we would certainly have to regard the Rev. Samuel Willard of Boston 
          as one of the virtuous clergymen, as he was opposed to the trials and 
          tried to influence public opinion against them in 1692. Undoubtedly, 
          great things had long been expected of Willard, as his family lineage 
          bespeaks that of a man destined to make an impact upon the community.</p>
        <p>Willard was born in the town Concord, Massachusetts Bay in 1640. His 
          place among the town's leaders was virtually assured from birth, as 
          his father, Simon Willard, was the founder of Concord. Willard soon 
          set out on the familiar course for young aspiring ministers, enrolling 
          at Harvard where he would study long enough to receive his Master's 
          Degree in 1659. Indeed, Samuel Willard could very well be remembered 
          solely for his fiery devotion to the Puritan church, as he was well 
          known for his vicious denunciations of any attempts to water down the 
          Puritan tenets of predestination, irresistible grace, total depravity, 
          and perseverance of the saints. Willard was also known for his staunch 
          support for the continued marriage between church and state, and held 
          strong opposition to the creeping Quaker and Baptist influences in the 
          community. In these ways, Willard's sermons were heavily influential 
          to men who would take up the Puritan cause after his death, Jonathan 
          Edwards in particular. Nevertheless, it is Willard's role in the witch 
          trials that concerns us here. </p>
        <p>Willard's past experience seems to make him a fine candidate to speak 
          out about the trials of the 1690s, as he played a crucial role in heading 
          off a potential outbreak of hysteria some twenty years prior to the 
          Salem episode. In 1671, while ministering in the frontier town of Groton, 
          Massachusetts Bay, Willard was witness to a number of strange acts that 
          befell one of his servants, a young girl of sixteen by the name of Elizabeth 
          Knapp. Knapp seems to have exhibited a number of the symptoms that would 
          be made famous by the "afflicted" girls of Salem village twenty years 
          later. Indeed, Knapp was observed to act in a "strange and unwonten" 
          manner, and often fell into violent fits and complained of being attacked. 
          When Knapp eventually accused the specter of a neighbor of attacking 
          her, Willard insisted she put an end to such accusations at once, for 
          the neighbor was a person of "sincere uprightness before God." Also, 
          Willard seems to have exercised good judgment in being hesitant to believe 
          that the devil afflicted the girl, writing that "Whither shee has covenanted 
          with the Devill or noe, I think this is a case unanswerable, her declarations 
          have been soe contradictorye. . . . ". Although Willard was yet to denounce 
          the idea of Satan using a person's image or specter to attack another 
          person, here he seems to have used impeccable judgment in not rushing 
          to conclusions about why his young woman appeared afflicted.</p>
        <p>Willard's role in Salem also presents a man concerned that innocent 
          people must be protected from the misinformed and vicious elements in 
          the Puritan society. When Governor William Phips sought guidance from 
          some of the learned clergy in the area, Willard was one of the several 
          who signed "The Return of Several Ministers." This document acknowledged 
          that while the devil might be responsible for the afflictions found 
          in Salem, it urged the court to exercise great caution to prevent the 
          innocent from being convicted. The ministers further discounted the 
          reliability of spectral evidence by asserting that the devil could impersonate 
          the likeness of any person, even an "innocent" without that person's 
          permission. Although the court in Salem ignored this caution, spectral 
          evidence was eventually called into question the trials lost their theological 
          foundation. The work of Willard and his like minded colleagues also 
          shows that to whatever extent clergymen in Salem may have contributed 
          to the witchcraft outbreak, Willard and other Boston ministers tried 
          to quell its spread. </p>
        <p>A level-headed moderate concerning witchcraft, Willard is thought to 
          have written a sixteen page fictional dialogue between two ministers 
          who hold opposed points of view on the Salem trials. One minister represented 
          the views of the Salem clergy, the other represented the Boston ministers. 
          The dialogue, entitled "Some Miscellany Observations on our present 
          debates respecting Witchcrafts: A Dialogue between 'S' and 'B'" is clearly 
          the work of one who saw great injustice in the theological and legal 
          aspects of the trials. Among Willard's chief complaints is the fact 
          that so often a confession coupled with further accusations resulted 
          in an acquittal, while a denial of guilt virtually guaranteed one's 
          conviction. Among the Boston minister's key arguments in the dialogue 
          is that "witches" who ultimately confess and accuse other witches are 
          not to be trusted, because, after all, they're witches! When the Salem 
          clergyman decries using too much caution, allowing many witches to go 
          free, Boston replies that "the more horrid the crime is, the more cautious 
          we ought to be in making any guilty of it." Boston's point being that 
          relying on the suspect spectral evidence was no basis from which to 
          ruin men and women's lives and cast a permanent stigma upon their family 
          name.</p>
        <p>Samuel Willard continued to be a tireless anti-trial activist well 
          after the trials had passed. In 1694, he pushed for a reconciliation 
          between the pro and anti-Samuel Parris factions within Salem village. 
          Willard was also known to ask, in public ceremony and sermon, for God 
          to forgive the atrocities that had taken place in Salem at the hands 
          of overzealous townsfolk. </p>
