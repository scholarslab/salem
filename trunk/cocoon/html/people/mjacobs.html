<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<font size=
"+1"><br /></font> Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Sixteen year-old Margaret Jacobs was the daughter of George
Jacobs, Jr. After her father was accused of witchcraft and fled
arrest from Salem Village, Margaret Jacobs was left in the care of
her mentally unbalanced mother and had to fight Judge Hawthorne and
his infamous court alone. Abandoned both by her father and by
uncle, Daniel Andrews, who had also fled arrest, she confessed to
having participated in witchcraft in order to save herself from a
trial. To strengthen her confession, she named her own grandfather,
George Jacobs, Sr. as a witch, knowing that he had already been
accused by others -- Marcy Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Sarah
Churchill. Later, stricken by her conscience, she recanted her
confession. According to Marion Starkey in <i>the Devil in
Massachusetts</i> , Margaret "confessed only under pressure of
fright when she had seen the accusing girls tumble down before her,
and out of terror of hanging." This statement emphasizes not only
the guilt of Margaret's conscience, but her knowledge and the
knowledge of all accusers, as to the nature of the trials at this
stage. If you confessed and named other people as witches, you
would not be tried or executed. Even at the price of her freedom,
Jacobs could not lie. In Starkey's words, she preferred a "death
with a quiet conscience than to live in such horror." The document
in which she repudiated her confession and accusations was produced
in court but had no effect on the judges, who wished to believe her
confession. Margaret was, however, allowed to visit her grandfather
in jail the day before his death and seek his forgiveness. George
Jacobs, Sr. did hear of Margaret's courageous act before he was put
to death and added a special provision for her in his will.<br />
<br />
On August 20, the day after her grandfather was executed, Margaret
wrote a moving letter to her father. She stated, "The reason of my
Confinement [in jail] is this, I having, through the magistrates
Threatenings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed several
things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding
of my own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! The terrors of a
wounded Conscience who can bear and God knows how soon I shall be
put to death"(<i>Salem Witchcraft Papers</i>.<br />
<br />
Bernard Rosenthal in <i>Salem Story</i> puts it best when he says,
"One does not often find people with the strength of Margaret
Jacobs," especially at such a young age. He is absolutely right. It
is rare to find someone willing to die for truth alone. Margaret
was not the only woman accusing her grandfather of witchcraft. He
could have been executed on the testimony of Sara Churchill and
Mary Walcott alone. Margaret's accusations did not lead directly to
her grandfather's death. She could have easily stuck to her story
and avoided prison and the possibility of death. Her retraction of
her accusation could not save her grandfather's life. The only
thing that came out of her appeal to the magistrates was her own
imprisonment and death sentence, both of which she accepted in
order to live and die with the truth. Jacobs demonstrated at the
age of seventeen a virtue that many people never acquire, moral
integrity. Her story is a story of conscience and contrition which
finds her alive in the end.<br />
<br />
She remained in prison after her grandfather's death, awaiting her
own fate. Her trial was temporarily postponed because of a boil on
her head, which proved fortunate for her, because the witchcraft
court was subsequently abolished, and she escaped the gallows. On
January, 1693 she was brought before the newly established Superior
Court of Judicature and found innocent.</p>
