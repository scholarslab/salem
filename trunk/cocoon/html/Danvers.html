<p>Though 17 miles north of Boston, and partially bounded by the
cities of Salem and Beverly, the town of Danvers with its 13 1/2
square mile area and 24,000 population still retains much of the
hominess and architectural heritage of old New England.</p>
<p>Known as Salem Village in the 17th century, there are still over
a dozen houses in Danvers dating from that era, many associated
with the witchcraft tragedy of 1692. Becoming independent from
Salem in 1752, Danvers witnessed the development of various
neighborhood villages, each having its era of prominence, and
possessing a unique character.</p>
<p>At the time of the Revolution, Danversport was a shipping and
shipbuilding center where tidal mills prospered. Its local bricks
became nationally famous, while the later leather tanning industry
brought a diverse and colorful mixture of new immigrant labor to
the area. Tapleyville emerged in the 1830s as a center for the
production of woven carpets where English and Scottish weavers
settled and made their homes. Danvers Plains took advantage of
important crossroads and the introduction of the railroad in the
1840s to become the prominent commercial center. Putnamville and
Danvers Highlands were noted for their important and early shoe
manufacturing industry, while farms throughout Danvers became known
far and wide for the Danvers half-long carrot, and the Danvers
onion, still popular today.</p>
<p>Though a number of Danvers' structures have been lost to fire
and "progress," much of the town's period architecture still
survives, and its written records have been preserved, making
Danvers an important and accessible area for period study.</p>

<center><i>Houses are generally private residences.</i></center>
<p><b>Hutchinson House (ca 1726),</b> <i>181 Centre Street.</i>
Structurally similar to houses built a generation earlier, this is
the birthplace of Col. Israel Hutchinson. A lieutenant at Wolfe's
capture of Quebec, Hutchinson led a company at the Lexington Alarm
and, in 1776, his 27th Regiment saved Washington's troops from
destruction by the British at Long Island by ferrying the army
across the river.</p>
<p><b>Putnam Burial Ground,</b> <i>485 Maple Street.</i> Here are
buried beneath an unmarked burial mound Ann Putnam and her parents,
Ann and Thomas, all of whom played key roles in the witchcraft
hysteria.</p>
<p><b>Upton Tavern (ca 1710),</b> <i>95 Centre Street.</i> On the
second floor of the structure is a ballroom having a curved ceiling
with delicately carved border.</p>
<p><b>Wadsworth House (1784),</b> <i>73 Centre Street.</i> A
square-hipped roof dwelling of Georgian design, this building was
built by prominent minister and patriot Rev. Benjamin
Wadsworth.</p>
<p><b>Ingersoll Ordinary,</b> 199 <i>Hobart Street.</i> The
earliest portion of house dates to the 17th century occupation of
Deacon Nathaniel Ingersoll, yeoman and innkeeper. It is on this
spot that many accused witches were examined in 1692.</p>
<p><b>Hutchinson-Kimball House (ca 1700),</b> <i>84 Forest
Street.</i> A fine example of "First Period" architecture.</p>
<p><b>Danvers State Hospital,</b> <i>450 Maple Street.</i> This
massive and impressive complex was designed for the care of the
mentally ill. The Victorian Gothic Kirkbride complex on the crest
of the hill was built between 1874-1877 under the direction of
architect Nathaniel Bradlee.</p>
<p><b>Watch House Hill,</b> <i>41 Centre Street.</i> On this site
was erected a fortified house to keep watch for possible Indian
attack. In 1700 the village church was erected here, as were
subsequent churches, and here Ann Putnam, chief witch accuser, made
a plea for forgiveness.</p>
<p><b>Haines House (1681),</b> <i>35 Centre Street.</i> Thomas
Haines, innkeeper, lived here during the witchcraft outbreak and
gave testimony which helped send Elizabeth How of Topsfield to the
gallows.</p>
<p><b>John Holten House (ca 1692),</b> <i>27 Centre Street.</i>
Attached to the right of the house is a structure called a Beverly
Projection.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Holten House (ca 1670),</b> <i>19 Centre Street.</i>
During the King Philip War Holten was wounded at the Narragansett
fight.</p>
<p><b>Holten Burial Ground,</b> <i>131 Holten Street.</i> Here lie
the remains of Dr. Samuel Holten who died in 1816.</p>
<p><b>Osburn House (ca 1680),</b> <i>273 Maple Street.</i> Moved to
this site in 1914. Here in this house lived sickly Sarah Osburn,
one of the first three accused of being a witch in 1692. Although
professing her innocence, she was thrown into jail where she died a
few months later, becoming the first victim of the delusion.</p>
<p><b>Wadsworth Burial Ground,</b> <i>18 Summer Street.</i> Here
lie the remains of the early settlers of Salem Village dating from
the 1640s. Literally hundreds of settlers are buried in unmarked
graves, including early ministers and their families as well as
persons killed by Indians. The superb stone of Elizabeth Parris
with a poetic epitaph by Samuel Parris is also here with other
ancient stones.</p>
<p><b>Putnam-Perry House (ca 1685),</b> <i>42 Summer Street.</i>
The birthplace of the Loyalist lawyer, James Putnam, this house was
later the part-time residence of Timothy Pickering, Secretary of
State under Washington.</p>
<p><b>Daniel Rea House (ca.1660),</b> <i>4 Elerton Lane.</i> An
early settler to the area lived in this house, which exhibits a
rare plaster coving below the front roof.</p>
<p><b>Octagon House (1848),</b> <i>148 Locust Street.</i> This
cement clad house with its octagon shape was a mid-19th century
American inspired architectural design.</p>
<p><b>Arnold Plaque,</b> <i>1 Conant Street.</i> This plaque
commemorates the encampment of General Arnold's forces in Danvers
while on their way to capture Quebec. Many Danversites took part in
this valiant but vain expedition.</p>
<p><b>Fellows-Masury House (1845),</b> <i>48 Elm Street.</i> This
house was owned by shoe manufacturer and prominent abolitionist
Alfred Fellows. Visitors included Frederick Douglass, Lloyd
Garrison, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, among others. At a later date
Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Coolidge were among other famous
guests.</p>
<p><b>Joshua Silvester House (1858),</b> <i>11 Peabody Avenue.</i>
This Mansard style house was one of the first in the United States
built of Portland cement. An octagon shaped stable is attached.</p>
<p><b>High Street Burial Ground,</b> <i>45 High Street.</i> Here
are buried many local Revolutionary War heroes, including Col.
Jeremiah Page, Col. Israel Hutchinson, and Nathan Putnam who was
severely wounded in the Lexington Alarm.</p>

country Federal style brick house, this was the residence of
Danversport mill and tannery owner Samuel Fowler, Jr.</p>
<p><b>Endecott Burial Ground,</b> <i>beyond end of Clinton
Avenue.</i> This ground was originally used as a campsite by the
