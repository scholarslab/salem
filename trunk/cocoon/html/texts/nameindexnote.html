<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>With the exceptions noted below, this Index contains each name
occurring in <i>The Salem Witchcraft Papers</i>. Included are all
persons who gave testimony or were its subjects, signed petitions
or offered recognizances for the release of jailed witches,
registered formal complaints resulting in an arrest warrant, or
were named in indictments as the afflicted victims of witchcraft.
All entries contain an identifying phrase and are cross-referenced
under the names of both the accused and their accusers or
defenders.</p>
<p>To keep the Index within manageable proportions without
significantly diminishing its usefulness, we have omitted the
following names:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Public officials such as constables, sheriffs, jailers,
examining magistrates jurors, etc.<br />
<br /></li>
<li>2. People mentioned in passing in any document who were neither
accusers or defenders nor themselves accused; people named in the
course of a public examination but who were not its subject(s); and
people included in lists of prospective witnesses but who did not
actually testify.<br />
<br /></li>
<li>3. Lists of names which occur in the officers' expense accounts
(pp. 945-962), and the various relatives of the accused who claimed
restitution in the 1710-11 period and afterwards (pp. 977-1046).
These post-1692 documents are, however, indexed under the name of
the accused person to whom they pertain.</li>
