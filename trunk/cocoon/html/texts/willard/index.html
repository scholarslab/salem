          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;I understand that you and 

            many others are greatly dissatisfied at 

            the Proceedings among us, in the pursuance 

            of those that have been Accused for Witchcraft, 

            and have accordingly sought to obstruct 

            them; which I am afraid will<b> </b>prove 

            pernicious to the Land; and that for more 

            reasons than one; principally in the hazzard 

            of Breaches and Divisions among us, which 

            tend to force unhappy Change ; and somebody 

            will be to blame.</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;Sir, the Peace of a Place 

            is earnestly to be sought, and they that 

            sinfully cause Divisions, will be guilty 

            of all the miserable effects of them but 

            whether this blame will truly fall upon 

            you or us, is to he considered there is 

            an earnest contending for the Truth requisite, 

            and that is not to be parted with for Peace.</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;<i>No </i>doubt every one 

            will justifie himself in his own way ; but 

            men are not for that Innocent : yea, the 

            most blameworthy are for the molt ` part 

            carried out with the greatest Confidence.</p>

          <p>A.&#9;True, I could reflect here ; but 

            I spare. Only give me leave to</p>

          <p>tell you. that we have more reasons to 

            plead our integrity by, than possibly you 

            know of or will easily believe.</p>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;<i> I should gladly, hear 

            them.</i></p>

          <p> <i>B</i>.&#9;I confess, the Animosities 

            on both lids have been sinful, and much 

            obstructive to the coming at the Truth : 

            but if you will promise placidly to argue 

            the Cafe with me, you (hall hear what we 

            have to say ; and I will as readily entertain 

            anything from you : and if we can come to 

            a better understanding between us, it will 

            be well.</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;The proposal is fair, and 

            I shall endeavor to comply with it ; only 

            give me leave first to Catechise you in 

            a few things.</p>

          <p><i>B.</i> &#9;I shall freely give you my 

            sense of anything you will ask. </p>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;Do you believe that there 

            are any Witches?</p>

          <p> <i>B</i>.&#9;Yes, no doubt; the Scripture 

            is clear for it; and it is an injurious 

            reflection that some of yours have cast 

            upon us, as if we called that Truth in question. 

            Whether anything we attest doth undermine 

            it, is to be considered.</p>

          <p><i>S. </i>&#9;And ought not these Witches 

            to be Punished ?</p>

          <p><i>B</i> &#9;Without question: the Precept 

            of Gods Word is for it: only they must be 

            so proved.</p>

          <p> <i>S. </i>&#9;But may not Witches be to 

            Detected, as to be liable to a right consious 

            Sentence and Execution</p>

          <p> <i>B.</i>&#9;I believe it, though I think 

            it not to easy as some make it, yet God 

            often righteously leaves them to discover 

            themselves.</p>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;Ought not the Civil Magistrate 

            to use utmost diligence in the Searching 

            out Witchcraft, where he is directed by 

            Gods Providence to grounds of a just suspicion 

            of it</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;Doubtless: yet ought he to 

            manage the matter with great Prudence and 

            Caution, an. attend right Rules in the Search. 

            But now give me leave to take the like liberty 

            of propounding two or three questions to 

            you ?</p>

            <li>With Freedom.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><i>B.</i>&#9;Taking it for granted that 

            there are Witches in NEW ENGLAND, which 

            no rational man will dare to deny; I ask 

            whether Innocent Persons may not be falsely 

            accused of Witchcraft ?</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;I verily believe it, and hope 

            none of you suppose us so uncharitable as 

            to think the contrary.</p>

          <p><i>B.&#9;</i>Do you not think it an hard 

            lot for an Innocent Person to have the aspersion 

            of Witchcraft cast upon him ?</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;Without scruple ; there being 

            no Crime more scandalous and abominable; 

            nor any that is with more difficulty wiped 

            off.</p>

          <p><i>B.</i>&#9;All of )-on are not so minded 

            on my Knowledge: but ought there</p>

          <p>not to be good grounds of suspicion, before 

            a person (especially of honest Conversation) 

            be brought on to the Rage to be examined 

            for such a Crime ?</p>

          <p><i>S.&#9;</i>I fee no danger in owning 

            the Affirmative ; I am not yet con` winced 

            that there is any Reflexion in it upon us.</p>

          <p>B.&#9;That is not my business : but did 

            you think that every suspicion is enough 

            to commit a man to Prison for suck a Crime 

            ?</p>

          <p>S. &#9;Why not, if the suspicion be built 

            on just Presumptions ! for this is only- 

            in order to a fair Trial, which is to pass 

            through two juries, where ` he will have 

            the liberty to Vindicate his Innocence openly.</p>

          <p><i>B.&#9;</i>You must give me leave to 

            diffent from you here, before I Proceed 

            in my Queries. I am informed that in a Legal 

            Warrant made for the Commitment of a Person, 

            his Crime may not be mentioned under the 

            Lenefying term of suspicion; but the Act 

            or Acts are to be Expressly Charged ; E. 

            G. you are to take into your Custody, &amp;-c. 

            for several Acts of Witchcraft Committed 

            on the body of, &amp;c. now certainly, there 

            is more than a meer suspicion upon fallacious 

            Presumptions, necessary for the doing of 

            this Honestly. Our statute Laws therefore 

            have provided great Cautions against the 

            Committing of persons without Substantial 

            rounds: Besides, it is certain, that on 

            lighter suspicions of Capital Crimes, Bail 

            may be taken; so that if the person be committed 

            to Goal, his Mittimus goes for want of Bail, 

            and doth not directly charge the Crime on 

            him; yea and Bail may Rill be taken after 

            Commitment. Moreover, Reason it self faith, 

            that when a man is Committed without Bail, 

            and may not come off without a Jury ; and 

            in order to that an Indictnent must be formed 

            against him, where the Acts are again to 

            be Positively &amp; Particularly charged 

            upon him, and Witnesses to be Examined, 

            which exposeth him to open Ignominy, there 

            ought to be something Substantial against 

            him. Yea Conscience will tell a justice, 

            that if he verily believes that a Grand 

            jury ought not, or cannot Legally find <i>Billa 

            vera</i> against such a man, he doth him 

            an ineparable wrong in so committing him 

            ; since hereby, his Credit is Steined, his 

            Liberty Restreined, his Time Lost, and great 

            Charges and Damages come upon him ; w<i>hich, 

            who shall </i>repair ?</p>

          <p>S.&#9;These things seem to have some weight 

            in them, but I think them aliene from our 

            Case: please then to Proceed.</p>

          <p><i>B&#9;</i>I<i> </i>believe them not so 

            aliene ; but for the present let me ask 

            : Do you think that a less clear Evidence 

            is sufficient for Conviction in the Case 

            of Witchcraft, than is necessary in other 

            Capital Cases, suppose Murder, c:; c.</p>

          <p>S. ' We suppose it necessary to take up 

            with less, how else shall ' Witches be detected 

            and punished according to Gods Command? 

            ' Witchcraft is </p>

          <p align="CENTER"></p>

          <p align="CENTER">(4)</p>

          <p align="CENTER"></p>

          <p>then esteemed Capital, when the person 

            is Guilty of `being in Combination with 

            the Devil ; which muff be proved by Presumptions 

            ; for who saw or heard them Covenanting?</p>

          <p><i>B.&#9;</i>This is a dangerous Principle, 

            and contrary to the mind of God, who hath 

            appointed that there shall be good and clear 

            proof against the Criminal: else he is not 

            Providentially delivered into the hands 

            of Justice, to be taken off from the earth. 

            Nor hath God exempted this Case of Witchcraft 

            from the General Rule. Besides, reason tells 

            us, that the more horrid the Crime is, the 

            more Cautious we ought to be in making any 

            guilty of it.</p>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;But how then shall Witches 

            be detected and executed? Must the Land 

            grown under the burden of them, and is there 

            no relief ?</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;Witches (as other Criminals) 

            are not to be executed till detected ; nor 

            are they detected, till indubitably proved 

            to be so : for which we are to use Gods 

            way, and wait his time : and his will in 

            his providence is, that some mens sins shall 

            go before hand to Judgment, and others shall 

            come after.</p>

          <p>S.&#9;But Divines fi Lawyers put great 

            weight on Presumptions as <i>Perkirs, Bernard, 

            Dalton, </i>&amp;c., and you seem to make 

            them insignificant.</p>

          <p><i>B.&#9;</i>So we are indeed charged, 

            but injuriously. :1s for <i>Dalton, </i>he 

            only prescribes Rules for Justices in their 

            private Capacity, for the Examining, or 

            at most the commitment of the Persons suspected; 

            and his Rules are given so Confusedly, that 

            I think no justice can understand his Duty 

            by them. As for <i>Perkins </i>and <i>Bernard, 

            </i>whom you instance in ; 1 presume that 

            either you have not read them, or mistake 

            them. They rightly distinguish between Presumption 

            and Conviction ; and tell us that some Presumptions, 

            are stronger than others; some only sufficient 

            for Examination, others enough for Commitment: 

            but they confidently aver, that all presumptions, 

            which are no more but to, are short of being 

            Concidion ; and <i>where are you then?</i> 

            and<i> </i>indeed they say nothing but what 

            hath good reason in it ; for to put a man 

            to death by bare Presumptions, is to do 

            it by guess, and that is something hard.</p>

          <p>S.&#9;You seem to be very nice and critical 

            in this point.</p>

          <ol start=2 type="A">

            <li>And why not ? there is Life in the case; 

              betides a perpetual infamy on the person, 

              and a ruinous reproach upon his Family.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>S.&#9;But what then will you allow for 

            a clear Conviction ?</p>

          <p><i>B.&#9;</i>I will<i> </i>tell you my 

            thoughts in several Particulars, :Against 

            which if you please you may objet : and 

            First, there mull be a matter of fact evidently 

            done, and proved: for, where there is no 

            fact there is no ground of accusation against 

            any person.</p>

          <p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

          <p align="CENTER">(5)</p>

          <p align="CENTER"></p>

          <ol start=19 type="A">

            <li>I shall make no reply against this.</li>

          </ol>

          <ol start=2 type="A">

            <li>Secondly; this matter of fact must carry 

              in it the Evidence of the Crime which 

              it is brought to prose.</li>

          </ol>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;What do you mean by evidence?</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;I mean, that it be infallibly, 

            or if you will, indubetably certain, that 

            he who did that fact, rendered himself by 

            it Guilty of the Crime, for the proof whereof 

            it is alledged ; otherwise, the Crime is 

            not found out by the fact.</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;Why may not a strong Presumption 

            do here, especially if there be many facts 

            which look that way?</p>

          <p> <i>B</i>.&#9;Good reason ; for if the 

            fact may be clone, and yet the person doing 

            it be innocent of the Crime, the Verdict 

            is meerly conjectural, and the man dyes 

            by will and doom: whereas God hath not granted 

            to men such a power over one anothers Lives. 

            If the Hypothesis be not necessary, there 

            can be no Evidence or Demonstration drawn 

            from it : and if the artificial argument 

            fail. the Testimony cannot affect the party.</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;You may please to proceed.</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;Thirdly ; a full and clear 

            Legal discovery, that the party accused 

            hath done the fact by which the Crime is 

            evidenced. For it is one thing to be certain 

            that there is Witchcraft in the thing, and 

            another to know who is concerned in it : 

            nor are we to fix it upon conjectures, be 

            they never so probable.</p>

          <p><i>S</i>.&#9;We shall agree in this Doctrine

            this Conclusion may- be made evident ; and 

            any one of them is sufficient : and they 

            are both of them well known, and plentifully 

            spoken to by Authors: it will there be needless 

            now to insist on them. </p>

          <p> <i>S</i>.&#9;Let us a little Discourse 

            on it, for possibly we are not of one mind 

            `about them.</p>

          <p>B.&#9;The first is, A free and full Confession 

            made by the Accused person, of the Fact, 

            being in his right mind, and not frightened 

            or forced into it.</p>

          <p>S.&#9;But may not a person falsely accuse 

            himself. and so dy of a Crime `of NN which 

            he is Innocent?</p>

          <p>B.&#9;He may : nevertheless, if all due 

            means be used, his Blood is on his own Head, 

            and the Civil Authority will be blameless.</p>

          <p>S.&#9;What mean you by a person in his 

            right mind</p>

          <p>B. One that is neither distracted nor discontented 

            ; and so may not be supposed either to confess 

            he knows not what ; or to do it to rid himself 

            of life, and to diffraction I account deep

          <p>prevalency of strange Imaginations, apt 

            to lead him into a belief of anything against 

            himself or others. In these cases much tenderness 

            is to be used.</p>

          <p>S.&#9;But how shall this be known ?</p>

          <p>B.&#9;Enquiry is to be made of those that 

            converse with them : and if there be nothing 

            appear but that the;- are in their right 

            mind, the Case is clear against them.</p>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;But you talk of a free and 

            voluntary Confession; so you condemn the 

            Examining of them by Civil Authority, and 

            strictly proving ` them by questions, which 

            are proper to bring them to such a Confession.</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;By no means, provided it be 

            fairly done.</p>

          <p>S.&#9;When is that ?</p>

          <p><i>B</i>.&#9;First when there are strong 

            Presumptions against the Person; and that 

            is the main use of Presumption, <i>viz.</i> 

            to bring the person upon Examination ; and 

            to do it without such, is a breach of the 

            Rule of Charitv, which is to think no evil.</p>

          <p><i>S.</i>&#9;And when else?</p>

          <p><i>B.</i>&#9;Secondly, As I before said, 

            when means are not used to force or fright
