          <p>SALEM - 


 Some of the most fascinating ar eas of the Salem Witch Trials Documentary
 Archive have nothing to do with the hysteria of 1692. Probate records, for example,
 provide an amazing window into everyday life in the Massachu setts Bay
 Colony, with meticulous lists of household items, from land to furnishings to
 the contents of the kitchen cupboard. &nbsp;</p>
          <p> Likewise, the records are a boon to the most active
          users of Salem's Phillips Library -- genealogists. </p>
          <p>Better yet, anyone with an In ternet connection can reach all this
          at www.salemwitchtrials.org. </p>
          <p>Site creator Benjamin Ray of the University of Virginia can't hide
            his enthusiasm when he discusses the court records of Essex County,
            volumes going back to 1636. He points out that 20th century archivists
            at the Phillips Library did yeoman's work in laboriously cataloging
          what's offered. </p>
          <p>&quot;What &nbsp; we're doing is leveraging work done at the Essex
          Institute,&quot; he says. </p>
          <p> The site's index alone is a treat to read. For example, in the
            period from 1636 to 1656 a list of crimes includes such remarkable
            accusa tions as &quot;careless grinding and toll taking,&quot; &quot;kissing,&quot; &quot;meddling,&quot; &quot;lust&quot; &quot;wearing
          silver lace <br>
          contrary to God,&quot; and &quot;uncharitable ness
          to a poor man in distress.&quot; </p>
          <p> Sometimes the crimes are not as exotic as the charge might indicate,
            and a simple mouse click can take you right to the actual language
          of the documents</p>
          <ul>
            <li> While the recordreads, &quot;Jonathan Platt indevoring to drawe
              away the afections of m. Rogers, his mayd is Judged to haue broken
            the law and is fined,&quot; without the consent of friends.&quot; <br>
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp; The ledgers show the Puritan concern for propriety,
                but they seem eager as well to set things right in the end, as
                when, &quot;Math ew Stanley and Ruth Andrewes fined 50s or to
                be whipped for for nication, but the fine to be remit ted
            if they marry together.&quot; </li>
          </ul>          
          <p>Some of the entries are poignant, leaving the reader with haunting
          questions: </p>
          <p> &quot;Mary Bidgood was required to appear for not repairing to
            her husband in England. Neighbors testified that he could not maintain
            her, nor did he require her to come to him, and by his letters had
            left her to herself and her friends here. She was permitted to remain
            for the present and 'to see what the pvydence of god may lead unto
            afterward.'&quot; </p>
          <p> Establishing an American tradi tion, debt is the most common crime,
          with more than 100 entries. </p>
          <p>Drunkenness is also a frequent charge, a fact perhaps not unrelated
            to numerous citations for slander and defamation, a serious matter
          to a people who very much saw the value of a good name. </p>          <p><a href="press.html">Back to Salem Press Archive</a> </p></td>
