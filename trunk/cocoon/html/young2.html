  A University That Reveres Tradition Experiments With E-Books<br>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;People all over the world have downloaded more than two 
        and a half million copies of e-books in the new formats from the Virginia 
        center's Web site since the texts were made available in August, says 
        Mr. Seaman. One reason for the popularity of the new formats, he suggests, 
        is that users can quickly download an entire book and then read it later, 
        offline, which is not easy with standard hypertext versions. </p>
      <p>&quot;We were surprised at how quickly second- and third-world users 
        were hitting on our e-books,&quot; he says, noting that some foreign libraries 
        might be supplementing their collections. &quot;They have no book budget, 
        but they have a modem.&quot; </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Relying on Books </font></p>
      <p>The less successful of Virginia's two classroom tests of the e-book format 
        was the graduate English course. The 18 students were lent hand-held computers 
        with electronic copies of all of the assigned books, but unlike the Salem 
        class, they rarely used the devices in the classroom, says Cynthia Wall, 
        the course instructor. Most of the students bought printed versions of 
        the books on the course reading list, even though their electronic copies 
        were free. </p>
      <p>During a recent class session, the hand-held devices in use by most of 
        the students were books themselves, dog-eared and annotated. When Ms. 
        Wall, a professor of English, referred to a given passage, the sound of 
        rustling pages filled the room. </p>
      <p>&quot;I love the physicality of books,&quot; says Kristen Jensen, a doctoral 
        student who is specializing in 18th-century literature -- and who bought 
        printed books for the course. Like many of her colleagues, she wants to 
        keep the books, along with her notes, after the course, and she knew she 
        would not be allowed to keep the hand-held computer. </p>
      <p>She found it disconcerting to see other students playing with their hand-held 
        computers during class. &quot;It feels rude,&quot; she says. &quot;You 
        notice when someone is poking around in their e-books.&quot; She couldn't 
        help asking herself, &quot;Are they playing solitaire?&quot; </p>
      <p>Ms. Jensen did find the e-books useful outside of class, however. She 
        used her Journada mainly for research, calling up electronic versions 
        of rare documents that she otherwise would have to read on microfilm or 
        in the library's rare-book room. &quot;Microfilm is wretched,&quot; she 
        says, explaining that she has spent plenty of time during her academic 
        career fumbling with plastic spools and microfilm readers. &quot;And it 
        is not very portable.&quot; </p>
      <p>Students in both courses engage in many types of reading during a typical 
        week on the campus. Sometimes they are just looking through an assigned 
        book for a good quote to support an argument. In that case, e-books do 
        the job nicely, many say. </p>
      <p>But at other times, students want to immerse themselves in a text -- 
        and for that, they say, paper is superior. One of the graduate students, 
        Alex Gil, says it is only a matter of time before e-books become a standard 
        feature of any course. He was the most enthusiastic e-book user in the 
        class, often reading from it during sessions. </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1">'They Can Coexist' </font></p>
      <p>To Ms. Wall, however, the experiment proved to her that a bookless campus 
        will never be. &quot;This cannot take the place of books,&quot; she says, 
        pointing at her hand-held computer. &quot;I think they can coexist.&quot; 
        Her biggest complaint is that lines of poetry in the electronic versions 
        are often broken because the screen is not wide enough. &quot;Poetry uses 
        space, and to see what a poem means you have to see how it looks,&quot; 
        she says. &quot;If you have heroic couplets where one line is broken in 
        half consistently, then you don't have the structure that [the poet] so 
        carefully designed.&quot; When students in the witch-trials course were 
        asked whether they believed that all of their books might one day be replaced 
        with e-books, several quickly protested. &quot;That's awful,&quot; said 
        one. </p>
      <p>Even Mr. Ray, the course's professor and a proponent of the technology, 
        says it will most likely supplement, rather than replace, printed books 
        at the university. &quot;We're high on technology, but there's this cherishing 
        of the book,&quot; he says, as he sits at the head of the seminar table. 
        &quot;Look where we are. This is old stuff that works.&quot;</p>
