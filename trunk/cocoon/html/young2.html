<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;People all over the world have downloaded more than
two and a half million copies of e-books in the new formats from
the Virginia center's Web site since the texts were made available
in August, says Mr. Seaman. One reason for the popularity of the
new formats, he suggests, is that users can quickly download an
entire book and then read it later, offline, which is not easy with
standard hypertext versions.</p>
<p>"We were surprised at how quickly second- and third-world users
were hitting on our e-books," he says, noting that some foreign
libraries might be supplementing their collections. "They have no
book budget, but they have a modem."</p>
<p><font size="+1">Relying on Books</font></p>
<p>The less successful of Virginia's two classroom tests of the
e-book format was the graduate English course. The 18 students were
lent hand-held computers with electronic copies of all of the
assigned books, but unlike the Salem class, they rarely used the
devices in the classroom, says Cynthia Wall, the course instructor.
Most of the students bought printed versions of the books on the
course reading list, even though their electronic copies were
free.</p>
<p>During a recent class session, the hand-held devices in use by
most of the students were books themselves, dog-eared and
annotated. When Ms. Wall, a professor of English, referred to a
given passage, the sound of rustling pages filled the room.</p>
<p>"I love the physicality of books," says Kristen Jensen, a
doctoral student who is specializing in 18th-century literature --
and who bought printed books for the course. Like many of her
colleagues, she wants to keep the books, along with her notes,
after the course, and she knew she would not be allowed to keep the
hand-held computer.</p>
<p>She found it disconcerting to see other students playing with
their hand-held computers during class. "It feels rude," she says.
"You notice when someone is poking around in their e-books." She
couldn't help asking herself, "Are they playing solitaire?"</p>
<p>Ms. Jensen did find the e-books useful outside of class,
however. She used her Journada mainly for research, calling up
electronic versions of rare documents that she otherwise would have
to read on microfilm or in the library's rare-book room. "Microfilm
is wretched," she says, explaining that she has spent plenty of
time during her academic career fumbling with plastic spools and
microfilm readers. "And it is not very portable."</p>
<p>Students in both courses engage in many types of reading during
a typical week on the campus. Sometimes they are just looking
through an assigned book for a good quote to support an argument.
In that case, e-books do the job nicely, many say.</p>
<p>But at other times, students want to immerse themselves in a
text -- and for that, they say, paper is superior. One of the
graduate students, Alex Gil, says it is only a matter of time
before e-books become a standard feature of any course. He was the
most enthusiastic e-book user in the class, often reading from it
during sessions.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">'They Can Coexist'</font></p>
<p>To Ms. Wall, however, the experiment proved to her that a
bookless campus will never be. "This cannot take the place of
books," she says, pointing at her hand-held computer. "I think they
can coexist." Her biggest complaint is that lines of poetry in the
electronic versions are often broken because the screen is not wide
enough. "Poetry uses space, and to see what a poem means you have
to see how it looks," she says. "If you have heroic couplets where
one line is broken in half consistently, then you don't have the
structure that [the poet] so carefully designed." When students in
the witch-trials course were asked whether they believed that all
of their books might one day be replaced with e-books, several
quickly protested. "That's awful," said one.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Ray, the course's professor and a proponent of the
technology, says it will most likely supplement, rather than
replace, printed books at the university. "We're high on
technology, but there's this cherishing of the book," he says, as
he sits at the head of the seminar table. "Look where we are. This
is old stuff that works."</p>
