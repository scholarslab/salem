<p>As editor-in-chief of the project to re-transcribe legal
documents pertaining to the Salem witch trials, I will be using
this web page to call attention to significant errors that have
been discovered in the current main printed source for such
materials, The Salem Witchcraft Papers (published in 1977). Some of
the errors and omissions in this edition are already known within
the scholarly community, while new ones are emerging as the
transcription process proceeds. Eventually, there will be a print
text of the new transcriptions in an edition to be published by
Cambridge University Press. People finding errors or omissions in
that edition will be cordially invited to point them out at this
site.</p>
<p>The column at this site will begin by publishing known errors
and omissions in The Salem Witchcraft Papers. At an appropriate
time, newly discovered errors will follow. Additionally, the column
will be used to point out errors about the Salem trials that appear
in print texts. The purpose of pointing out these errors will never
be to embarrass the authors of them and will always reflect to the
extent possible issues of fact rather than interpretation. The hope
is that scholars will appreciate an opportunity to correct their
mistakes, something they usually cannot do in print texts. So that
there is no appearance of trying to denigrate the work of others, I
will begin this feature by addressing errors I have made in print.
I will also welcome comments from other scholars pointing out their
own errors as well as errors of others. I emphasize again that the
purpose of this is to keep scholarly information up to date for
those seriously interested in doing research on the trials or in
generally learning about them.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> SWP transcription drops words from the original
manuscript (SWP, III, 756). <b>The SWP transcription
reads:<br /></b> The Deposition of Sam: Parris aged about thirty
&amp; nine years testifyeth &amp; saith that Eliz: Hubbard were
most grevously &amp; severall times tortured during the examination
of Sarah Good, Sarah Osburne &amp; Tituba Indian before the
Magistrates at Salem Village I. March. 1691/2 (Vol. III, 756)</p>
<p>A corrected transcription is as follows:</p>

Williams &amp; Ann Putnam<br />

times....</p>

<tr>
<td><b>8.</b> SWP prints a mistaken transcription (SWP, III, 748)
"rats" for "cats."</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><b>9.</b> SWP incorrectly identifies Sarah Wilds as a witness
against Sarah Good (SWP, II, 364):</p>
<p>(Witnesses v. Sarah Good)</p>
<p>against<br />
Sarah Wilds<br />
John Andrews<br />
William Perkins<br />
Joseph Andrews</p>
<p>(Note: the following is written vertically across paper which
appears to<br />
be a memo of some kind rather than a bona fide record) &amp; also
for Sundry other Acts of Witchcraft by S'd Good Comitted &amp; done
before &amp; Since that time</p>
<p>(Reverse) Complaints Warrants &amp;c <b><br />
( Essex County Archives, Salem -- Witchcraft Vol. 1 Page 55
)</b></p>
<p>Although the text seems clearly to indicate that the three men
are witnesses against Sarah Wilds, the segment placed with the
Sarah Good section incorrectly suggests that the three men and
Sarah Wilds are witnesses against Sarah Good. No testimony by any
of these four people appears anywhere against Sarah Good. Testimony
by John and Joseph Andrews does appear against Sarah Wilds. No
testimony by William Perkins appears anywhere in SWP, but there is
testimony by Zacheus Perkins, who may be related to William,
against Sarah Wilds.</p>
