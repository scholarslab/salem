dismissed, &amp; before the Church's communion at the Lords Table,
the following testimony against the Error of our sister Mary Sibly,
who had given direction to my Indian man in an, unwarrantable way
to find out Witches, was read by the Pastor.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino"><font face=
"Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is altogether undenyable that
our Great &amp; Blessed God, for wise &amp; holy ends hath suffered
many persons, in several families, of this little Village, to be
grievously vexed, &amp; tortured in body, &amp; to be deeply
tempted, to the endangering of the destruction of their souls;
&amp; all these amazing feats (well known to many of us) to be done
by Witchcraft, &amp; Diabolical operations. It is also well known
that when these calamities, first began, which was in my own
family, the affliction was several weeks before such Hellish
operations, as Witchcraft was suspected. Nay it never broke forth
to any considerable light, untill Diabolical means was used by the
making of a Cake by my Indian man, who had his direction from this
our sister Mary Sibly : Since wch Apparitions have been plenty,
&amp; exceeding much mischief hath followed. But by this means (it
seems) the Devil hath been raised amongst us, &amp; his Rage is
vehement &amp; terrible, &amp; when he shall be silenc'd the Lord
only knows. But now that this our sister should be instrumental to
such distress, is a great grief to myself, and our godly Honoured
&amp; Reverend neighbours, who have had the knowledge of it.
Nevertheless, I do truly hope, &amp; believe, that this our sister
doth truly fear the Lord, &amp; am well satisfied from her, that
what she did, she did it ignorantly, from what she had heard of
this nature from other ignorant, or worse persons. Yet we are in
duty bound, to protest against such actions, as being indeed a
going to the Devil, for help against Devil, we having no such
directions from Nature, or Gods word, it must therefore be, &amp;
is, accounted by godly Protestants, who write or speak of such
matters as Diabolical, &amp; therefore calls this our sister to
deep humiliation for what she has done, &amp; all of us to be
watchful against Satans wiles &amp; Devices.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino"><font face=
"Times New Roman, Times, serif">Therefore, as we in duty, as a
Church of Christ are deeply bound, to protest against it, as most
directly contrary to the Gosple, yet in as much as this our sister
did it in ignorance as she professeth, &amp; we believe, we can
continue her in our holy Fellowship, upon her serious promise of
future better advisedness and caution, &amp; acknowledging that she
is indeed sorrowfull for her rashness herein.</font></font></p>

(in their estimation) "unwarrantable actings " of their Pastor, Mr.
Parris, in the matter of Witchcraft, do therefore habitually absent
themselves from Public Worship, and from "Communion at the Lord's
Table," notwithstanding the endeavors of the Pastor and Church to
enforce their attendance thereupon. The grounds of their
dissatisfaction are these: 1. "The distracting and disturbing
tumults and noises made by the persons under Diabolical power and
delusions, preventing, sometimes, their hearing and understanding
and profiting by the word preached." 2. "Their apprehensions of
danger of themselves being accused as the Devil's instruments to
molest and afflict the persons complaining; they seeing those whom
they had reason to esteem better than themselves thus accused,
blemished, and of their lives bereaved."</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino"><font face=

principles of their Pastor, and his frequent and positive preaching
of the same, with respect to the dark and dismal mysteries of
iniquity working amongst them, and their molestation from the
invisible world; his easy and strong faith and belief of the
affirmations and accusations made by those they call the afflicted;
his approving and practising unwarrantable methods for discovering
what he was desirous to know referring to the bewitched or
possessed persons, as in bringing some to others, and by and from
them pretending to inform himself and others who were the Devil's
instruments to afflict the sick and pained ; and his not rendering
to the world a fair if true account of what he wrote on examination
of the afflicted." 4. "His unsafe and unaccountable oath given by
him against sundry of the accused; and his zeal in seeking out the
suspected, insomuch that one of the disaffected brethren (John
Tarbell by name) tells him to his face that he has been "the great
persecutor, and that had it not been for him his; mother Nurse
might have been still living, and so freed from execution." 5. "His
persisting in these principles and justifying his practices, though
others, wise and learned, who were as forward as himself, are sorry
for what they have done, and see their error"
therein.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino"><font face=
"Times New Roman, Times, serif">The disaffected brethren, having
first taken "the advice of some neighboring Elders," two of them
repair to the house of their Pastor on the 27th of March, 1693,
accompanied by one "William Osburne, of Salem," and two others, as
"witnesses," and give him a paper, wherein is expressed their
desire for "a Council of Elders, mutually chosen, to hear ill
grievances between their Pastor and selves, and to determine where
the blameable cause is," purporting to be in the name of "all the
Plantation, or a great many of them at least," but without either
signature or date. The which paper, when Mr. Parris had read, he
puts into his pocket, and replies that he will "consider of
it."</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Palatino"><font face=
"Times New Roman, Times, serif">But sundry conferences being had,
and still no signs of reconcilement, the breach rather growing
wider, the brethren refusing to be dealt withal in a Church way,
but preferring a petition to his excellency, the Governor and the
General Court, and sending letters to divers remote Churches,
complaining of their "Church and minister as unpeaceable with their
neighbors;" at the last, "Mr. Willard, in the name of the Elders at
Boston:" writes to the Rev. Messrs. Higginson, Noyes, and Hale,
desiring to persuade the Church at Salem Village to join with the
complainants in calling a Council of neighboring Churches, not
excepting against any on either side; -- whereupon these Rev.
Gentlemen addressed letters to Rev. Mr. Parris and his Church, in
the month of October, (?) 1693, signifying to them the advice of
the Elders ; the which not being followed, by reason of the
non-agreement of the contending parties, and the unhappy
differences being protracted through the winter and spring, the
disaffected brethren and neighbors again apply to the neighboring
ministers, desiring them to meet together, and try if they can give
any, direction for the healing of the sad dissensions in their
midst. Accordingly,</font></font></p>
