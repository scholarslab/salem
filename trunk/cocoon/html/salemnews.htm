"#000000">DANVERS -- Those accused of witchcraft in Old Salem
Village 300 years ago were put to death by hanging. But try and
find that vital fact on the Internet, and you might be out of
luck.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">"You see things like ... they were burned at the stake,"
said Richard Trask, town archivist. "There's so much bogus stuff
out there, it's amazing."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">There is at least one Web site with accurate information
about the witchcraft hysteria, though.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">It's the new Danvers Archives home page, which can be
reached at <a href=
"home.html">http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft</a>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">The site, which has been up and running only a few weeks,
contains court documents from the Rebecca Nurse trial.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">There's information about historical sites in Danvers,
the witchcraft memorial, and an excerpt from Trask's book "The
Devil Hath Been Raised."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">So far about 70 pages of historic material have been
entered into the system, Trask says, with more to be added this
year.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">The site is the brainchild of Ben Ray, a professor of
religion studies at the University of Virginia.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">As the story goes, Ray came to Danvers about five years
ago hoping to find out about his ancestors, a prominent Danvers
family.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">Through Trask and Anthony Patton, a Locust Street
resident who lives in a Colonial home once owned by Ray's family,
the professor learned that four of his ancestors signed petitions
supporting Nurse.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">But when Ray turned to the Internet for more information
about the witchcraft trials, he found little of
substance.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">"A lot of it was sensationalist or New Age," he said.
"There was (information) that the Salem witches were of an ancient
pagan religion, which is a terrible distortion."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">"What I objected to the most was the celebration (on some
sites) of the whole thing," he said. "I began thinking about what I
might do in a small way to correct that."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">So Ray, through the university, teamed with Trask, the
authority on the witchcraft trials, to establish the first Danvers
Archives Web site. He also had it listed on major search
engines.</font></p>

<br />
<br />
<font size="3" face="Times Roman" color="#000000">And that's just
the beginning. Ray has received $15,000 in grant money to establish
a University of Virginia witchcraft Web site for in-depth research.
The site will contain all information available about the
witchcraft trials and should serve as a warehouse for data on the
hysteria.</font> <font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">"People will be able to investigate demographic question
like ... how many women we accused who had no sons or heirs to
their property," Ray said.</font>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">The site will also feature maps and complete courtroom
texts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times Roman" color=
"#000000">Trask and other scholars act as consultants on the
project, Ray said. It will be linked to the Danvers Archives
site.</font></p>
