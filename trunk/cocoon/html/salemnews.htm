DANVERS -- Those accused of
witchcraft in Old Salem Village 300
years ago were put to death by
hanging. But try and find that vital
fact on the Internet, and you might
be out of luck.</p>

"You see things like ... they were
burned at the stake," said Richard
Trask, town archivist. "There's so
much bogus stuff out there, it's
amazing."

There is at least one Web site
with accurate information about the
witchcraft hysteria, though.

It's the new Danvers Archives

The site, which has been up and
running only a few weeks, contains
court documents from the Rebecca
Nurse trial.

There's information about
historical sites in Danvers, the
witchcraft memorial, and an excerpt
from Trask's book "The Devil Hath
Been Raised."

So far about 70 pages of historic
material have been entered into the
system, Trask says, with more to be
added this year.

The site is the brainchild of Ben
Ray, a professor of religion studies
at the University of Virginia.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

As the story goes, Ray came to
Danvers about five years ago
hoping to find out about his ancestors, a prominent Danvers family.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
Through Trask and Anthony
Patton, a Locust Street resident who
lives in a Colonial home once owned
by Ray's family, the professor
learned that four of his ancestors
signed petitions supporting Nurse.

But when Ray turned to the
Internet for more information about
the witchcraft trials, he found little
of substance.

"A lot of it was sensationalist or
New Age," he said. "There was
(information) that the Salem witches
were of an ancient pagan religion,
which is a terrible distortion."

"What I objected to the most was
the celebration (on some sites) of
the whole thing," he said. "I began
thinking about what I might do in a
small way to correct that."

So Ray, through the university,
teamed with Trask, the authority on
the witchcraft trials, to establish the
first Danvers Archives Web site. He
also had it listed on major search
engines.

And that's just the beginning. Ray
has received $15,000 in grant money
to establish a University of Virginia
witchcraft Web site for in-depth
research. The site will contain all
information available about the
witchcraft trials and should serve as
a warehouse for data on the hysteria.

"People will be able to investigate 
demographic question like ... how 
many women we accused who had no sons or heirs to their property,"

Ray said.

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman" COLOR="#000000">
The site will also feature maps and complete courtroom texts.

Trask and other scholars act as consultants on the project,
Ray said. It will be linked to the
Danvers Archives site.
