Historian <strong>Richard Trask</strong> is a leading authority on
the Salem witch-hunt of 1692. He serves as Town Archivist for
Danvers (formerly Salem Village), Massachusetts, where he is
custodian of all early town records, the Brehaut Witchcraft
Collection, and tens of thousands of manuscripts. He is also
curator of the Rebecca Nurse Homestead and he chaired the Salem
Village Witchcraft Tercentennial Committee from 1990 to 1992. Trask
has written numerous books and articles on Salem and two of his
ancestors were hanged as witches.</p>
<p>These frequently asked questions were posed to Trask on a
National Geographic "Salem Witchcraft Hysteria" Web Site. He gives
brief, simplified answers to these questions.</p>

<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: What is the difference between a
Puritan and a Pilgrim? Where did they settle?</font>
<blockquote>A: "Pilgrim" is a modern term for a 17th-century
Englishman who believed in complete separation from the Anglican
church. Pilgrims generally settled in Plymouth Colony, south of
Boston, and referred to themselves as "separatists." Puritans were
17th-century Englishmen who wanted to purify the Anglican church by
removing all traces of Catholic papist trappings, such as crosses,
vestments, or anything resembling Catholicism. They generally
settled in the Boston area starting around 1630. Plymouth Colony
was absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1692.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: How was witchcraft defined in
the 17th century?</font>
<blockquote>A: In the 17th century, witches were both male and
female persons who had made a pact to serve the devil. In exchange,
the devil passed along certain powers to the witches. According to
confessed witch William Barker, the devil promised to pay all
Barker's debts and that he would live comfortably. The devil also
told him that he wanted to set up his own kingdom where there would
be neither punishment nor shame for sin.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: To what degree did one's
socio-economic position play a part in the trials? Were any of the
"elite" ever named as witches or was this primarily the plight of
the agrarian community?</font>
<blockquote>A: In most witchcraft cases, the status and sex of the
witch had much to do with who was accused. It began that way with
1692 Salem, but eventually became much more democratic as to who
was accused. Many men were accused, as were a number of church
members and upper class types, including Philip English, one of the
Colony's richest men. It is true that rich or influential persons
could find means of escape.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: What was the average age of the
"witches" and the "afflicted" persons?</font>
<blockquote>A: In the Salem cases, accused witches could be any
age, from a four-year-old girl up to individuals in their 80s and
90s. As for the "afflicted ones," most were adolescent girls
between the ages of 9 and 18, though they were joined by some older
women and by at least two adolescent boys.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: What is known about
Tituba?</font>
<blockquote>A: If it weren't for the Salem witchcraft proceedings,
we would know nothing about Tituba. And precious little is known
about her. Almost nothing is written about lower-class people of
that era. There is evidence that suggests that Tituba was not black
but an Indian. After her imprisonment, Tituba was sold by the
Reverend Parris, and the rest of her existence was lost to
history.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Were Salem witches ever burned
at the stake?</font>
<blockquote>A: No. According to English law, which prevailed in New
England at the time, witchcraft was a felony punishable by hanging.
In continental Europe witchcraft was heresy against the church and
was punishable by burning at the stake.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Is there any modern medical
explanation for the children's behavior?</font>
<blockquote>A: From 1692 to the present, various observers,
researchers, and scholars have attempted to explain what caused the
outbreak at Salem. The theories are many: backsliding New
Englanders being punished by God, power-hungry clergy, the pranks
of bored adolescents, socio-economic conflict, ergot poisoning, and
so on. It seems that every new generation reflects its own time in
trying to explain what happened in 1692 Salem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>My feeling is that, although there were many factors
involved in setting the stage, the witch-hunt was powered by
clinical hysteria. You might want to read "Witchcraft at Salem" by
Chadwick Hansen.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: What happened to the so-called
"afflicted" girls?</font>
<blockquote>A: Most of those young women have been lost to history.
The young ones married, changed their names, and moved away.
Several remained in the area, however. Ann Putnam never married,
but eventually made an apology for 1692 and became a full member of
the Salem Village church. She was said to be "sickly" and is known
to have died young. Elizabeth Parris married and moved about 20
miles from Salem Village to Concord.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Why were some of the accused
convicted even after they maintained that they were Christians? How
were the cases investigated? What evidence was found?</font>
<blockquote>A: Generally, citizens made complaints against
individuals, who were then brought before magistrates for
preliminary hearings. When magistrates felt that there was
sufficient evidence for a trial, the accused was jailed pending a
hearing before a grand jury. And if those juries handed up a "true
bill" (signifying evidence of misbehavior), a formal trial by jury
could follow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The formal trial followed 17th-century English
precedents, in which the accused were not represented by lawyers
but could question accusers and witnesses. Most, however, were not
emotionally or intellectually equipped to defend themselves against
a hanging court and hysterical witnesses--over 40 persons confessed
to being witches.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The historical irony is that only those who did not
confess to being witches were actually tried and convicted. And
with "spectral evidence" being accepted, your accuser is the only
person who presents and verifies your "crime." So, you could say
the afflicted girls provided the evidence while sometimes other
confessed witches corroborated it.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Why were they considered
witches?</font>
<blockquote>A: If you confessed that you were a witch, as Tituba
did, they could use this as <em>prima facia</em> evidence. Over 40
people in 1692 did in fact confess, and in some instances those
confessing accused others. Also, the court tended to believe the
afflicted--those who claimed to be tormented by the spectres of
witches--and the spectral evidence exhibited within the court
itself really made believers of those who were present. Judge
Stoughton and other prominent officials believed that God would not
allow the spectre of an innocent person to afflict
others.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Was Giles Cory pressed to death
because he wanted to hold onto his estate?</font>
<blockquote>A: No. Although convicted witches might have had their
personal estates confiscated according to the law, their land could
be inherited. Cory was most likely showing his complete distaste
for the court and its legitimacy. When Cory was indicted, he
refused to enter a plea to be tried.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: What brought about the end of
the Salem witchcraft hysteria? Did some of the judges refuse to
convict for reasons of conscience?</font>
<blockquote>A: There were a number of factors that ended the
hysteria. The chief reason was that "spectral evidence" against the
accused was eventually disallowed, which meant there wasn't enough
additional evidence to bring about convictions.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: When did the people of Salem
realize that they had made a grave error?</font>
<blockquote>A: By 1693 is was recognized that incorrect procedures
and invalid proofs had been used. Most people, however, still
believed in witchcraft as a reality. Following the trials, the
people felt that the devil was still loose among them, but that he
had deluded people into believing that innocents were
witches.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Although by 1700 most learned people doubted the
reality of witchcraft, there were scattered witchcraft accusations
in America far into the 18th century.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Did the British crown take any
action on this matter or was it left to the colony?</font>
<blockquote>A: Obviously there was a communication problem at that
time in terms of asking for advice and receiving responses from the
mother country. Even if there had been instant communication, the
English government would most likely have kept its hands off what
was considered a local problem. Massachusetts Governor Phips, as
the representative of the Crown, was expected to take care of his
provincial problems. Phips received some advice--when it was almost
all over--that said "Do what you think is
appropriate."</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Are there any witchcraft laws
today in Salem?</font>
<blockquote>A: There are no Massachusetts statutes with respect to
witchcraft. In 1992 the Massachusetts House of Representatives
passed a resolution acknowledging the good names of those condemned
witches of 1692 who had not been previously
exonerated.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Does "The Crucible" portray what
actually happened in Salem?</font>
<blockquote>A: This is my opinion: When someone watches a play, he
knows that he is partially suspending belief and not observing
accurate visual reality. The words, not the stage setting, are the
most important components of the play. Playwright Arthur Miller
successfully used the Salem witch trials as a vehicle to talk about
witch-hunts in general, but the Miller play does not attempt to
make a historical representation of the witchcraft events. It also
gives a dramatized, incorrect account of John Procter and Abigail
Williams.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the film, given the nature of the medium, the
audience assumes that if the setting and characters look real, then
the events portrayed are displaying reality. And most will take it
for granted that the film presents the story as it truly occurred,
which usually is not the case. The movie version of "The Crucible"
as well as Oliver Stone's film "JFK" are entertaining, but poor
history lessons.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Are there any descendants of
those 25 who died?</font>
<blockquote>A: There are undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of
descendants living in the U.S. today.</blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="#D99C5A">Q: Why did Salem become the center
of the witchcraft tourist trade when the actual events took place
in what is now the Town of Danvers?</font>
<blockquote>Salem Village (Danvers) was ground zero of the
witchcraft events of 1692, with virtually the entire 500 person
population involved. Salem Town (Salem), though they had several
accused witches who lived there and had the formal trials there,
escaped the social and religious maelstrom that followed. When
witch times were over, Salem Village didn't want to be reminded of
those dark days. When the Village became independent in 1752, it
was given the new name of "Danvers" and their association with the
witchcraft was happily obscured. By the late 19th century, Salem
became a tourist destination and the witchcraft events took on a
caricature of a non-threatening witch riding a brookstick and
wearing a conical hat.</blockquote>
