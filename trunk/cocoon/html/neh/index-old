<p>It was just a few years ago that I actually paid any attention to that family connection. I'm an  Africanist and work generally on a different continent, so it wasn't something I was looking into either in a scholarly way or as family history until 
I went to pick up my daughter from college in Boston. My wife and I decided we would make a side trip to Danvers, which is the old Salem Village, and look up where my ancestors lived. I found some still-standing houses, which was amazing. One is a 
seventeenth-century house. I thought, "My goodness, there are actual buildings standing there that my ancestors lived in." So I began to look at the published documents a little bit more. There is an index and you can look up everyone's name, or almost 
everyone's name. I noted that my family's names were always listed mainly as defenders, which is something I hadn't heard about. You hear about accusers and the accused and the ministers and judges, but there were a number of villagers who were trying to save 
those who were accused by signing petitions, testimonials, on their behalf. Unfortunately, that had absolutely no effect, and some risk for the people doing it.

<p>I'm working with a colleague. My job is the more 
technological side, giving access to this material. Bernie Rosenthal, who is in the English Department at SUNY-Binghamton, is the editor-in-chief of a new transcription of the court documents. There 
are about 850 court documents. The Puritans documented everything they did, both good and bad. This really tells the story of the people. You hear the voices of the accusers and the voices of the accused, the judges, the ministers, even occasionally some 
of the attendants. The most valuable kind of document is, in fact, not the arrest warrants and the depositions so much as the actual courtroom interaction where you hear those confrontations. 
</p>

<p>As I was looking in the archives in Boston, particularly at the Boston Public Library, I ran across some of these transcripts, which apparently had been overlooked by earlier scholars and transcribers. Just encountering those and transcribing them 
for the first time was pretty exciting. I think every historian is eager to 
find something new in a territory that has already been well worked over.

<p>We have a few search mechanisms. For example, a previous transcription of the court documents has been available since 1977, and although they're flawed and based on work during the WPA period of the Great Depression, they are nevertheless 
pretty good, and we have those online. For example, if you type in the word "witch," you will get every occurrence in what are approximately three volumes of documents. And for the first time, a high school student can write a paper on the subject of the 
concept of the witch in the trials, or the concept of the devil, or the concept of evil as it was used by judges and accusers and the accused. You can get a good handle on this conceptual terrain and what was going on that was so inflammatory at that time.

<p>There are several things going on. We are using the Internet to provide access to materials that have been difficult for our students, let alone the general public, to work with. A colleague of mine in the history department has taught a course 
on the Salem witch trials only once in the twenty years that he has been here, even though he is a Puritan historian, because you can't really get these primary sources into the students' hands for them to get excited about unless you have every student 
owning three volumes of court documents, which are in fact out of print. So it has been difficult to teach this subject except by secondary sources. What's exciting for historians is to put primary source materials in the hands of the students so they can 
participate in the kind of scholarship that scholars do. You can then teach the craft of scholarship, whether it is history or any other subject. <br><br>

<p>The Reverend Parris is the minister of the village meetinghouse. And it

Elizabeth Parris, with her birthday there, you see she's only 
ten years old. And then her cousin -- and we will have 
genealogies attached to this -- is Abigail Williams. 
She is the niece of Samuel Parris and the cousin of Elizabeth. She is an accuser, too. 
</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing I like. You go to images and click and go to the illustration of Tituba's encounter with the famous Puritan clergyman Cotton Mather. So here you have the fair-skinned, fair-haired young Cotton Mather encountering this image
 of an elderly Native American woman with her basket full of herbs, scowling and looking very mean. If you go to Tituba in image number two, you see something quite different. This is a 1997 image from a juvenile book. Tituba is no longer an elderly 
Native American. She is a young African American, with the girls fascinated with her divination, which uses an egg white in a glass. 
</p>

<p>These images through time relate to both oral tradition and actual text traditions. We can link texts with these and the surrounding context of how the American imagination has dealt with the episode across time, including racial, ethnic, and gender
perceptions.

<p>We will always be attracted to the theory that weights the cause in one direction. It is like the McCarthy trials, which Arthur Miller wrote the play The Crucible to reflect upon. There is a nexus of factors that allowed this to happen. You have 
neighbors with grudges. You have ministers who were eager to seek a revival of faith and religious authority. You have judges, particularly the chief 
justice, who had a political interest -- 
he had his eyes on the governorship. You have petty disputes among 
families living in the villages. You have a new charter for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and a little uncertainty about how to proceed.

<p>It wasn't just the village. Twenty-seven people in Salem Village were accused. In the village of Andover, there were forty-seven. In the town of Salem, there were seven. Up as far as Wells, Maine, and down to Boston, more than 150 people were 
accused. So you have a large area of Massachusetts Bay that is involved, too, making any one explanation a little too simplistic for a complex phenomenon. <br><br>

<p>I'm not sure how that came about. It was funded by the WPA program, but it was a clerk of courts in Essex County that oversaw the actual transcription and the collection together of the documents so they could be transcribed, a wonderful recovery 
because some of these documents, the originals, have now been lost since that 1938 transcription. They existed in typescript, and in 1977 they were put out in published form. That created a watershed of scholarship.

<p>There is not a whole lot of evidence to help us. She is said to have come from Barbados with the Reverend Samuel Parris, who was the owner of a sugar plantation, which failed, and he sold it. It is said that the two slaves he brought with him, 
Tituba and her husband John, were from Barbados, but they were always referred to in the court documents as Indians. Consistently, there are numerous documents specifying her name and following it with the word "Indian." The Puritans differentiated between 
African Americans, and they were slaves, and those that they called Indian, who I assume meant Native American. But a little bit beyond that, you can't go. They never called her black and never called her African, which is the term they use for several of 
the slaves who appear in the witchcraft documents.
</p>

<p>One of the issues, on the other hand, is simple to resolve: What kind of witchcraft did she know about, or what kind of divination was she teaching, if she taught the girls in the Parris household? Was she teaching something that we can now identify
 as, say, culturally African or Caribbean? The answer to that is quite simple: No. If she were involved at all in teaching the method of divination, what she was teaching was European, the egg white in the glass of water. As the egg white sinks into the 
water and swirls around and you look in the glass, it's kind of like a moving Rorschach, and that is a European technique. Riding on a pole in the air, which she confesses to, is also a European idea. And seeing witches in the woods in some kind of ritual 
context is also a European idea. So all of the documents give us information about her, and what she was doing and her knowledge of anything related to witchcraft or divination indicates it was European and not West African. As an Africanist, that's 
pretty clear to me.

<p>Not much. Apart from Tituba and two or three others -- 
Mary Black -- there weren't too many slaves mentioned in the documents, and very few of them were accused. The accusations generally fall along lines of previous social conflict between families 
who are in either positions of power and are contesting each other 
or are contesting property, as you mentioned, or they're contesting relationships they have in the church or other relationships.
</p>

<p>Going up the social ladder, you have another group of people accused: Those are people who are beginning to object to the trials, even the governor's wife. John Alden, son of two rather famous figures, Priscilla and John Alden, becomes caught up in 
the accusations because he's an Indian fighter. The rumors are that he also had Indian women and some sort of relationship with them; those rumors get translated into accusations. So it spreads around the whole social ranking system pretty quickly.

<p>That's easy: a covenant with the devil. It was the mirror image of the covenant the Puritan was to make with God. Becoming a member of the Church was something you did as an adult. You signed a book of membership after being examined by your

</p>

<p>The reverse was true, then, with the devil, throughout the documents. The devil would present a book, and you were to sign it. This was an act of not just religious aversion, but since it was a theocracy, a political aversion, so it was an act of 
betrayal. For that, if you were guilty, you were beyond the pale. The condemned witches were not buried in cemeteries. They were outcast. They were executed outside the town, beyond the borders of the community, because they were agents of a subversive

<p>In New England, the accusations were very local, only two or three people, and the judges and the clergy were most concerned to control the accusations and to dampen down this avenue of social redress. Even in the prelude to Salem, some girls in 
Boston were going through physical gyrations and verbal abuse, and accusing people, and Cotton Mather was most concerned that they did not begin to attract others to make similar accusations. There was a general attitude of damping down accusations when they
 occurred and not acting on them so that it would inflame others.

<p>In Europe, you have larger numbers accused, and it is much more tied 
up with state and church-political institutions -- 
until Salem. In Salem, there were more accused than ever had been 
in the history of New England, and even more executed. That is 
what has attracted scholars, what happened in Salem. The 
accusations started at the end of February 1692, and

<p><b>Arthur Miller created a vivid image of seventeenth-century Salem 
in his play <i>The Crucible</i>.  The witch-hunt is 
now an icon in the public imagination.

acquainted with Arthur Miller's version of the story?</b>

<p>There is a website that I've come across that is pretty good at dealing with the differences between his play and historical events in Salem. His play is very effective, obviously, and he has taken literary license with history, which I think is 
fine to make a unified, effective dramatic piece.
</p>

<p>I think what you get in the documents is as riveting as in Miller's play when you read the voices of the accusers and the accused. They claim their innocence in a dramatic form and assert themselves almost against both church and state. They are 
thinking: Before God I am innocent, and something has gone off the rails here. The church and the state are going in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>The dramatic voice of those courtroom scenes comes through as strongly 
as in the documents as in Miller's slightly adapted version. In Salem today re-enactors perform segments of the court trials, lifted right from the actual words of the documents.<br><br>

<p>It is hard to reconcile -- our view of America as a land of freedom to which people came who were fleeing persecution and to discover that, at least in Massachusetts Bay, those very people set up a system which could eventually become a system of 
persecution of the kind they fled. 
It stands as an aberration of what we think of as our founding principles. 
And it is a gripping story of heroic victims 
-- mainly women -- 
and vengeful persecutors, both male and female, young and old.

<p>I never knew of the interest in Arthur Miller's play, to the Salem events, until I happened to talk with friends who live in Europe, where the play is regularly performed and resonates there, too, in a way that relates to their experience in the 
former Soviet Republic, for example, in Latvia. <br><br>

<p><b>Absolutely. I can't tell you how exciting it is to see what you and your colleague, Ed Ayers, are doing with the mixing of technology and scholarship in such creative new ways. I wonder if you could reflect on that.

<p>Somebody said that there is "something in the water in Charlottesville," 
where we've taken technology and tried to use its tools to extend and to 
enliven the educational mission. I think it has to do with the commitment 
at various levels of the 
university from the top down, the president's office, from alumni 
donors who are excited, from institutions. IBM started contributing, and 
Xerox Foundation did. They were looking for institutions who might be 
interested in technology. A member of the 
engineering school said to IBM, "Why don't you put some technological 
machinery in the humanities area? Let's see what will happen when you do that." Ed Ayers saw the potential and his example then led others to take a look. We have developed programs for the 
classroom, a teaching and technology initiative. We have developed programs for faculty research projects at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, which is supporting the Salem project. It has caught on through a few good examples  and 
wonderful institutional support. This technology is not a way of necessarily teaching more with less, as some might fear in other schools, but teaching better and exciting your faculty about the possibilities. That is why it has caught on, I think. It has 
excited us about teaching and research. Ed and the rest of us are as excited about how we can apply it to our classrooms and our students as we are in advancing purely scholarly goals for the community of scholars. Our work is aimed both at research as well
 as application in the teaching mission.

<h2>The Many Manifestations of Tituba
</h2>

<p>In Tituba's Encounter with Cotton Mather in <u>The Woods of Salem</u>, 
by J. W. Ehningere, Tituba is depicted as an elderly American Indian Woman. 
In the Children's Book Illustration by Robert Gantt Steele, she is a 
young, energetic African American girl.
 In Maryse Conde's <u>I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem</u>, 
excerpted below and translated with NEH support by Richard Philcox, 
she is portrayed as an African American woman. Tituba's actual 
ethnic origins remain a mystery to this day.

<p><i>Then Goodwife Parris told me what was going on in the village. "I can only compare it to a sickness that first of all is thought to be benign because it affects the lesser parts of the body . . ." Lesser parts? It's true that I was only a black 
slave. It's true Sarah Good was a beggar. So great was her poverty that 
she had to abstain from coming to the meeting house for want 
of clothes. It's true that Sarah Osborne had a bad reputation 
because the Irish immigrant she had hired to help her on the farm 
quickly advanced from 
the widow's barn to her bed. But even so, it was shocking 
to hear us coldly described as "lesser parts."

<p>Next spring we will involve students in helping us think up the interface, that is, think up interesting and attractive ways that will turn students loose. We are creating a database that will enable them to query the database and ask questions and 
get tables and answers in response. We are quite excited. When you put in genealogy and demographics and social ranking together with text documents and images and search engines, we don't know what we will come up with.
