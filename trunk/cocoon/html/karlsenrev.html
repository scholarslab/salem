<p><i>The Devil in the Shape of a Woman</i> by Carol Karlsen (1987)
astutely focuses attention upon the female as witch in colonial New
England, thus allowing a discussion of broader themes regarding the
role and position of women in Puritan society. Karlsen's work,
which has been well-received, focuses on the position of accused
witches as largely females placed in precarious social and economic
positions, often because they stood to inherit, had inherited, or
lost an inheritance in property. Karlsen departs from the idea that
women accused of witchcraft were boisterous beggars, a depiction
"tantamount to blaming the victim" (Nissenbaum) and instead points
to these "inheriting women" as being socially vulnerable in a
patriarchal culture.</p>
<p>Karlsen's work is not merely of historical significance to the
Salem outbreak of 1692. In fact, "that year remains something of an
anomaly" (Nissenbaum) as one-third of the accused witches then were
male compared to less than one-fifth of accusations made otherwise
in colonial New England. Instead, Karlsen's study brings "women
strongly back to center stage, locating them in a rich patriarchal
matrix that integrates it with class and family." (Nissenbaum). One
reviewer notes that within this context, Karlsen offers significant
insights. The first is a look at the "ambivalent assessment of
women within New England's culture." (Gildrie). Karlsen finds a
scenario marked by its time and place in which women embodied the
"Puritan ideal of women as virtuous helpmeets" (Boyer). In an odd
duality, women were both the new stewards of God's spiritual
leadership on earth, while subservient to a Medieval, misogynist
gender role which largely placed their fate at the hands of
men.</p>
<p>Secondly, Karlsen focuses attention on the accusers and finds
that they were engaged in a "fierce negotiation... about the
legitimacy of female discontent, resentment, and anger." (Karlsen;
see Gildrie). Accusations of witchcraft were often an outlet where
this negotiation boiled over into violence, as men persecuted
female neighbors who threatened an established, but precarious,
social order. The crucial thesis on which much of the book rests is
that witchcraft accusations were most often made against women who
threatened the orderly transfer of land from father to son - a
process at best fraught with tension and anxiety and at worst
marked by the shift of scarce, valuable properties from one family
to another by way of an intervening woman in a patriarchal
inheritance system. The possessed girls played a dual role in this
"symbolic cultural drama" in which they rebelled against the social
role to which they had been predestined at birth by simultaneously
acquiescing in that role by resisting the "witch."</p>
<p><br />
If nothing else, Karlsen's recent work proves that there is still
room for substantial study and scholarship surrounding witchcraft,
gender, and other issues in colonial New England. One commentator
writes, "Karlsen's study is provocative, wide-ranging, accessible,
and frank." (Lindholt). Another, that the book's "descriptions and
analyses stand on their own as valuable contributions to our
knowledge of witch lore and the ambiguous status of women in early
New England." (Gildrie). Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, whose
<i>Salem Possessed</i> set the standard for social histories of the
outbreak in Salem, find that Karlsen's work is one of "formidable
intellectual power" and "a major contribution to the study of New
England witchcraft." It places the central role of women as witches
under the microscope and "for the first time as the subject of
systemic analysis" a considerable 300 years after the events
transpired. Karlsen's work is required reading for the student,
scholar, or general reader seeking to understand and interpret the
broad picture of colonial witchcraft in New England.</p>
