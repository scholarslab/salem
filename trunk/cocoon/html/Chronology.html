Nine-year-old Elizabeth Parris and eleven-year-old Abigail Williams

began to exhibit strange behavior, such as blasphemous screaming,

convulsive seizures, trance-like states and mysterious spells. 

Within a short time, several other Salem girls began to demonstrate 

similar behavior.<P>

<DT>

<I><B>Mid-February</B></I>

<DD>

Unable to determine any physical cause for the symptoms and dreadful

behavior, physicians concluded that the girls were under the influence

of Satan.<P>

<DT>

<I><B>Late February</B></I>

<DD>

Prayer services and community fasting were conducted by Reverend Samuel

Parris in hopes of relieving the evil forces that plagued them.

In an effort to expose the &quot;witches&quot;, John Indian baked a witch cake

made with rye meal and the afflicted girls' urine. This counter-magic

was meant to reveal the identities of the &quot;witches&quot; to the afflicted

girls.

<P>

Pressured to identify the source of their affliction, the girls named

three women, including Tituba, Parris' Carib Indian slave, as witches.

On February 29, warrants were issued for the arrests of Tituba, Sarah

Good and Sarah Osborne.

<P>

Although Osborne and Good maintained innocence, Tituba confessed

to seeing the devil who appeared to her &quot;sometimes like a hog

and sometimes like a great dog&quot;. What's more, Tituba

testified that there was a conspiracy of witches at work in Salem.<P>

<DT><I><B>March 1</B></I>

<DD>

Magistrates John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin examined Tituba, 

Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne in the meeting house in Salem Village.  

Tituba confessed to practicing witchcraft.

<P>

Over the next weeks, other townspeople came forward and testified

that they, too, had been harmed by or had seen strange apparitions

of some of the community members. As the witch hunt continued,

accusations were made against many different people. 

<P>

Frequently denounced were women whose behavior or economic 

circumstances were somehow disturbing to the social order and 

conventions of the time. Some of the accused had previous records 

of criminal activity, including witchcraft, but others were 

faithful churchgoers and people of high standing in the community.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>

<I><B>Margaret Jacobs</B></I>

and the new governor, Sir William Phips.<P>

<DT>

protests of her accusers, she was arrested a second time.<P>

Governor Phips set up a special Court of Oyer and Terminer 

comprised of seven judges to try the witchcraft cases. 

Appointed were Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton, 

Nathaniel Saltonstall, Bartholomew Gedney, Peter Sergeant, Samuel

Sewall, Wait Still Winthrop, John Richards, John Hathorne, and 

Jonathan Corwin. 

<P>

These magistrates based their judgments and evaluations on various

kinds of intangible evidence, including direct confessions, supernatural

attributes (such as &quot;witchmarks&quot;), and reactions of the

afflicted girls. Spectral evidence, based on the assumption that

the Devil could assume the &quot;specter&quot; of an innocent person, was

relied upon despite its controversial nature.<P>

<DT>

<I><B>May 31</B></I>

English were examined before Hathorne, Corwin, and Gedney.<P>

<BR><EM>&quot;I am no witch. I am innocent. I know nothing of it.&quot;</EM>

<P>

Following her death, accusations of witchcraft escalated,

but the trials were not unopposed. Several townspeople

After 20 people had been executed in the Salem witch hunt, 

Thomas Brattle wrote a letter criticizing the witchcraft trials.
