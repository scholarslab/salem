<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Textbook pages never rustle during a University of
Virginia seminar about the Salem witch trials, because printed
books have been replaced by electronic ones. Students in the
experimental course were lent hand-held computers loaded with
several assigned textbooks, as well as electronic versions of every
warrant, indictment, and deposition from the trials.</p>
<p>The course was designed to take advantage of two of the most
celebrated features of digital textbooks -- their capacity to hold
reams of data and their ability to let readers easily search for
any word or phrase. In the classroom, students became on-the-spot
historians, using the gadgets to home in on court documents so they
could argue for and against various interpretations of what
happened in Salem, Mass., more than 300 years ago.</p>
<p>Many futurists have predicted the death of the book, but the
printed word has proven extremely difficult to replicate
electronically in a form that is as elegant and easy to read as
text on paper. A pilot project here this spring, comprising two
courses, attempted to see whether the latest e-book technologies
could allow entire courses to go bookless.</p>
<p>During class sessions, students tapping on tiny screens with
plastic styluses looked more as if they were taking scientific
readings than discussing history and religion. The setting was
decidedly old-fashioned, though; the class met in one of the few
classrooms remaining from Jefferson's "academical village."</p>
<p>"Whenever we got to talking about something in a document, we
would just go to the document," says Amy Nichols, a senior who took
the course. The students say they used court records and other
texts more than they would have with bulky printed versions of the
same documents.</p>
What's more, the students were bolder than usual in criticizing
scholarly summaries of events presented in their textbooks, says
Benjamin C. Ray, the religious-studies professor teaching the
course. In fact, they were often too quick to dispute scholarly
accounts once they came upon source material that seemed to
contradict the textbook, he says. "I think they're going overboard.
They're trashing too much ... without knowing the historical
methods."<br />
<br />
<font size="+1">Losing Data</font>
<p>For their part, the students quickly discovered disadvantages of
the high-tech texts. Unlike paper books, e-books sometimes crash.
Several students lost marginal notes and bookmarks when their
hand-held computers suddenly erased their data.</p>
<p>Some students said reading from the tiny screens made the texts
seem more fragmented. "When I'm at home sitting on my chair curled
up with the afghan on my lap, I don't want to be flipping through
this," says Kristen Buckstad, a student in the course, holding up
her Hewlett-Packard Journada, which sells for about $450. The
hand-held device is roughly the size of a Palm Pilot, with a
2-1/2-by-3-1/4-inch color screen and enough memory to store about
90 books. "The screen is too small," she says. "It's hard to get
the overall feeling of the flow of the narrative."<br />
<br />
Students can also read their assignments on laptops or desktop
computers. The electronic texts are available on the World Wide Web
through Virginia's Electronic Text Center, which since 1992 has
worked with the university's libraries to create digital copies of
scholarly and literary books.<br />
<br />
Titles in that archive include classic texts that are no longer
covered by copyright, as well as texts for which the university has
bought the distribution rights. Its virtual shelves feature a mix
of the often-studied and the obscure, in languages that include
Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Latin, and Apache.</p>
<p>The e-text center selected two courses for its pilot project:
the one on the Salem witch trials, which is a senior-level
undergraduate course, and a graduate-level English course about
depictions of space in 18th- and 19th-century literature.</p>
<p>The e-books for both courses were formatted with new Microsoft
text-display software called Reader. Microsoft provided most of the
loaner hand-held computers -- and did its best to turn the two
courses into product focus groups. A representative from Microsoft
sat in on one session of each course and later interviewed many of
the students. Those who agreed to be interviewed got copies of
Microsoft Office 2000 for their trouble, though many felt that the
company was being stingy in not letting them keep the Journadas as
well.</p>
<p>The promise of the Reader software is to provide an interface
that faithfully simulates the pages of a book, in typefaces that
are clearer and easier to read than typical computer fonts. The
e-text center has converted 1,600 e-books in its online library to
the Microsoft format since last summer. It also has created
versions of the same books using text-display software developed by
Palm for use on its hand-held computers. Standard hypertext
versions of the texts remain available as well.</p>
<p>David Seaman, director of the center, says the new formats are
far better to curl up with for extended reading than traditional
Web formats. "Nobody reads books on the Web. You think of the Web
as a searching-and-browsing technology. It's not a reading
technology."</p>
