  <head><name>Bridget Bishop</name></head>
  <p>Written By Sarah Nell Walsh</p>
	
<p>Bridget Bishop was a self-assertive woman who had been accused of witchcraft 
prior to 1692. Previous experience had taught her to deny allegations 
of witchcraft at all costs. Unfortunately, in 1692 the situation was 
different and her only salvation lay in false confession, which she 
refused to do. Bridget Bishop was married to Edward Bishop when she 
was accused of witchcraft in Salem. She was widowed twice before marrying 
Edward. Her second husband Thomas Oliver accused her of witchcraft, 
claiming that "she was a bad wife. . . the devil had come bodily to 
her . . . and she sat up all night with the devil." This previous accusation 
of witchcraft in 1680 was remembered and probably explains her arrest 
and sentencing in 1692.</p>
				
<p>John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin presided over Bridget's examination 
on April 19, 1692. Many of her accusers were present at the examination, 
including Elizabeth Hubbard, Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, Mercy Lewis, 
and Mary Walcott. A summary of the courtroom examination follows. </p>

<p>As soon as Bridget Bishop entered the courtroom, the afflicted girls 
fell into fits. Judge Hathorne asked which witchcrafts she was conversant 
in, to which she replied, "I take all this people (turning her head 
and eyes about) to witness that I am clear." Then Hawthorne asked the 
girls if they had been afflicted by Bishop, to which Elizabeth Hubbard, 
Ann Putnam, Abigail Williams, and Mercy Lewis affirmed that she had. 
The afflicted girls charged her with having hurt them in many ways and 
tempting them to sign the book of the devil. Ann Putnam even went so 
far as to say that Bishop called the devil her God. Bishop continued 
to proclaim her innocence by saying that she "never saw these persons 
before, nor [ever] was in this place before." She claimed to be as "innocent 
as an unborn child." </p>
					
<p>At that point, Mary Walcott said that her brother Jonathan had torn 
Bishop's coat while fighting off her specter. When they examined Bishop's 
coat, they found the tear in exactly the same location. Judge Hathorne 
continued the attack on Bishop when he accused her of bewitching her 
first husband to death. She shook her head no in response to the question, 
which set the afflicted girls into fits. Sam Braybook affirmed that 
although she told him that she had been accused of witchcraft ten years 
ago, "she was no witch and the devil cannot hurt her."</p>

<p>Bridget Bishop apparently became frustrated with Hathorne's continual 
attack on her character and his disbelief in her innocence. Her deferential 
attitude soon gave way to anger as she slowly realized that denial was 
not an effective strategy. The following interchange between Bishop 
and Hathorne is very memorable and is often quoted. </p>
					
<p>Bishop staunchly states, "I am no witch." To which Hawthorne replies, 
"Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you have 
gone? Have you not to do with familiar spirits?" "I have no familiarity 
with the devil." "How is it then that your appearance doth hurt these?"</p>

<p>"I am innocent."</p>

<p>"Why do you seem to act witchcraft before us, by the motion of your 
body, which seems to have influence upon the afflicted."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch 
is."</p>

<p>"How do you know then that you are not a witch."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you say."</p>

<p>"How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch is."</p>

<p>"I am clear: if I were any such person you should know it."</p>

<p>"You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are permitted"</p>

<p>"I am innocent of a witch."</p>

<p>After this comment, Bridget apparently rolled her eyes towards heaven. 
Immediately, all the girls rolled theirs, and it seemed to the court 
that a devil was on the loose. After this examination, Bishop was asked 
if she was not troubled to see the afflicted girls so tormented. She 
answered no. When asked if she thought they were bewitched, she answered 
that she did not know what to think about them.</p>
					
<p>Cotton Mather, using the court records, wrote about the trial of Bridget 
Bishop in his book <title>Wonders of the Invisible World</title>. The trial 
was held on June 2, 1692 in the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Even Mather 
admitted that it was hard to prove the witchcraft, even though "it [was] 
evident and notorious to all beholders." During Bishop's examination 
before the magistrates, the afflicted girls behaved as if they were 
tortured. It seemed that by casting her eye upon them, Bishop could 
strike them down into fits. The only thing that would stop these fits 
was the touch of her hand upon the girls. Abigail Hobbs, a woman who 
had already confessed to being a witch, played into this drama by testifying 
that Bishop's specter tormented her because of her confession. She also 
affirmed that Bishop had been present at a meeting of witches, in a 
field at Salem Village, and took part in a diabolical sacrament.</p>
					
<p>In addition to this evidence, evidence of other previous witchcraft 
was brought to light. Bishop was accused of murdering children, bewitching 
pigs, and coming to various townsmen during the night. In further evidence, 
"poppets" were found in the wall of her cellar. These puppets were made 
of rags and hogs bristles, with headless pins in them. Bishop could 
"give no account unto the court, that was reasonable or tolerable." 
The final piece of damning evidence was when a jury of women found a 
"preternatural teat" upon her body. Within three hours, the teat had 
disappeared, adding to the intrigue.</p>
					
<p>Her case served as a model for future cases to come, following a very 
predictable pattern. The afflicted girls made accusations, which were 
denied by the accused; one or more confessors validated the claim of 
the accusers; and members of the community told of past acts of witchcraft 
by the accused. The court used spectral evidence as the only legal basis 
to convict Bridget Bishop. Hanged on June 10, her death warrant emphasizes 
only the harm done to her accusers, primarily on the day of her examination, 
as the legal justification for the execution. Bridget Bishop was the 
first person to be hanged as a result of the infamous Salem witchcraft 
trials. </p>

<!-- Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature 
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia
Spring Semester 2001 -->
<p>Pre-Trial Examination: March 24, 1692</p>

<p>Rebecca Nurse, a sick and elderly woman of seventy-years old, stood for 
examination before the court on charges of practicing witchcraft on March 
24, 1692. Judge John Hathorne, assisted by Judge Jonathan Corwin, conducted 
the examination in the meeting house of Salem Village before a crowd of 
people from Salem Village. The examination of "Goody Nurse" developed 
into a spectacle worthy of the attendance of so many onlookers, as a number 
of afflicted women launched into "grevious fitts" and openly denounced 
Rebecca Nurse as the cause of their torment. In the end, after one of 
the great confrontations between an accused and the infamous Judge Hathorne, 
the Judges found cause to bind Rebecca Nurse over for trial after which 
she was executed on Gallows Hill on July 19, 1692.</p>

<p>The examination of Rebecca Nurse was recorded by the Reverend Samuel Parris, 
whose own young daughter Betty was one of the accusers together Betty's 
cousin, twelve-year old Abigail Williams. He writes that the examination 
opened with Hathorne turning his attention not to Nurse, but rather to 
Abigail Williams. Williams reported to the magistrates that the apparition 
of Nurse had just that morning, as well as on previous occasions, afflicted 
her. Shortly after this statement, Ann Putnam, Jr. launched into a "grievous 
fit" and before Rebecca Nurse even began to testify, the tone of the examination 
had been set.</p>

<p>Hathorne first turned his attention to Nurse, and pointedly asked her 
to account for the accusations of Williams and Putnam. Nurse, defiant 
and incredulous to the end, responded, "I can say before my Eternal Father 
I am innocent and God will clear my innocency." Following the first of 
many denials on Nurse's part, Hathorne turned his attention to the assembly 
to hear additional evidence against Nurse. After receiving two more accounts 
implicating Nurse in witchcraft, this time from adult men in the community, 
Hathorne put the question more directly. "Are you an innocent person relating 
to this witchcraft?" </p>

<p>Before Rebecca Nurse could respond, Ann Putnam, Sr. interrupted and cried 
out to Nurse, "Did you not bring the Black Man with you," and the examination 
descended into a barrage of accusations as Mary Walcott and Elizabeth 
Hubbard join in by crying out that Nurse afflicted them right there in 
the meeting house. </p>

<p>In an interesting aside in the examination record, Parris wrote that one 
of these accusations came from, "Mary Walcott (who often heretofore said 
she had seen her, but never could say or did say that she either bit or 
pinchted her, or hurt her)". Here, Parris, who actively encouraged the 
accusations in Salem Village, suggests that Walcott was now able to confirm 
that Nurse was the cause of her previous torment. Then the girls, with 
their eyes on Nurse's agitated movements, imitated her postures by contorting 
their own bodies. Thus they made it appear that Nurse implicated herself, 
as the afflicted cried out in pain with every movement of the examinant's 
head and arms, gaining the attion of the judges and the onlookers. Yet 
even in the face of this seemingly damning evidence, Nurse steadfastly 
proclaimed her innocence: "The Lord knows I have not hurt them. I am an 
innocent person." </p>

<p>The banter between Hathorne, and possibly at times Corwin, and Nurse continued 
as the judges attempted to badger a confession using different rhetorical 
devices. The judges asked why Nurse stood stoically in the face of such 
afflictions suffered by the girls, to which Nurse replied, "You do not 
know my heart," and that she was, "... as clear as the child unborn." 
The effort to force a confession is clear, as is the constant and unwavering 
refusal of Rebecca Nurse to "bely" herself by bearing false witness against 
herself, though at this early stage in the trials she could not know that 
confession was the way to buy time and avoid the gallows.. </p>
				
<p>Hathorne, likely frustrated at Nurse's refusal to cooperate and confess 
her dealings with the Devil, attempted a new approach. "They accuse you 
of hurting them," he stated, "and if you think it is not unwillingly but 
by designe, you must look upon them as murderers." The significance of 
this line runs deep. First, Hathorne by this statement deftly forced Nurse 
to explain the afflictions witnessed in that very room as, if not her 
fault, then the fault of the very girls so "grievously afflicted". Second, 
by stating that the afflicted girls would be "murderers" if merely pretending 
their affliction "by designe", it certainly became abundantly clear to 
Rebecca Nurse that it would be her own death to which these afflicted 
women would soon be responsible if they were lying, as executions had 
yet to be ordered or begun in Salem. It was Hathorne's final, desperate 
attempt to force a confession from Nurse by ensuring she understood that 
her own life was in the balance. </p>

<p>As the examination drew to a close, the best Hathorne could wrest from 
the steadfast Nurse was that though she did think the afflicted were "bewitcht", 
she stated that "I cannot help it, the Devil may appear in my shape." 
This small admission, made only after Hathorne had asserted that at least 
her apparition was culpable, still did not gain Hathorne full confession 
he wanted. Therefore, after an examination that was truly a circus hardly 
befitting a true and legal hearing, Judges Hathorne and Corwin bound Rebecca 
Nurse over for the trial which would result in her execution on charges 
of practicing witchcraft.</p>
