               Dragon fought and his Angels. 13. Chap. 7. It was given to him to make

            <p class="div4">1. For Instances. We find the Devil Assaulting the Lamb as soon as he
               was borne to the end of his dayes. As we see in his instrument
               Herod. 2. Matth. 7&amp;c. And afterwards by his Manifold Temptations
               of Christ in the Wilderness 4. Matt. And afterwards by his stirring
               up the chief of the Jewes to kill Christ. 26. Matth. 3. 4. And to
               help forward that Murder the Devil puts it into the heart of one of
               Christs Disciples to betray him. 13. Joh. 2. And after all though
               the Lamb be killed, but yet liveth for ever, &amp; no advantage got
               by the Devil by the Murder of Christ, why now he seeks to destroy
               his Church: And for this end influenceth bloody Saul to lay all
               waste. 8. Acts. 3. 9. Ch. 1. 2. But now when the Lamb had conquered
               this bloody Instrument, &amp; of a Saul, made him Paul, a Preacher
               of Righteousness why now the Devil as much opposeth Paul. 13. Acts.
               4. &amp;c. Yea the scripture is full of such instances. Church
               History abounds also with evidences of this truth. Yea &amp; in our
               dayes, How industrious &amp; vigorous is the Bloody French Monarch,
               &amp; his Confederates against Christ &amp; his Interest? Yea, &amp;
               in our Land (in this, &amp; some neighboring Places) how many, what
               Multitudes, of Witches &amp; Wizards has the Devil instigated with
               utmost violence to attempt the overthrow of Religion?
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div4">2. The Reason, &amp; that in a word is from the enmity of the Devil
               &amp; his Instruments to Religion. 13. Acts. 10. Thou Child of the
               Devil, thou enemy of all Righteousness. Now the seed of the Devil
               will do the works of the Devil. 8. Joh. 44. Ye are of your Father
               the Devil, &amp; the lusts of your Father ye will do &amp;c. Satan
               (sais one. Trapp in loco) is called the God of this world, because
               as God at first did but speak the word &amp; it was done: So if the
               Devil do but hold up his finger, give the least hint of his Mind,
               his Servants &amp; Slaves will obey.

            <p class="div3">2. This War shall be as long as they can. It shall not be for ever, &amp;
               alwayes. Here
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div4">1. Sometimes the Devil looseth his Volunteers in War. The Lawful
               Captive, the Captives of the Mighty, are sometimes delivered. 49.
               Isa. 24. 25. We have an instance in bloody Saul. 9. Acts. 3.
               &amp;c.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div4">2. Sometimes the Devil is chained up; s that he cannot head &amp;
               forme an Army, as otherwise he would against the Saints. 20. Rev. 1.

            <p class="div4">3. Last: After this life the Saints shall no more be troubled with
               War from Devils and their Instruments. The City of Heaven, provided
               for the Saints, is well-walled, &amp; well-Gated, &amp;
               Well-Guarded, so that no Devils nor their Instruments shall enter
               therein. 21. Rev. 10. &amp;c.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            <hr></hr>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div2">1. Use. It may serve to Reprove such as seem to be amazï¿½d at the War the
               Devil has raised amongst us by Wizards, &amp; Witches against the Lamb and
               his Followers that they altogether deny it. If ever there were Wirches, Men
               &amp; Women in Covenant with the Devil, here are Multitudes in New-England.
               Nor is it so strange a thing there should be such: no nor that some Church
               Members should be such. The Jews after the Returne of their captivity,
               wofully degenerated even unto the horrible sin of Sorcerie &amp; Witchcraft.
               3. Mal. 5. Pious Bishop Hall saith, The Devils prevalency in this Age is
               most clear in the Marvailous number of Witches abounding in all places. Now
               hundreds (sais he) are discovered in one Shire; &amp; if Fame deceive us
               not, in a Village of 14. Houses in the North, are found so many of this
               Damned brood. Heretofore only Barbarous Desarts had them, but now the
               Civilest &amp; Religious Parts are frequently pestered with them: Heretofore
               some silly ignorant old Woman, &amp;c. &amp; but now we have known those of
               both Sexes, who professed much Knowledge, Holiness, &amp; Devotion, drawn
               into this damnable practise. Baxters Apparitions &amp; Witches. pag.
               122. Also the same Mr. Baxter speaks of a Woman who pretended to have
               the holy Ghost, &amp; had a Gift of Prayer, &amp; did many wonders, proved
               to be a witch. p. 123.

            <p class="div2">2. Use. We may see here who they are that War against the Lamb, &amp; his
               Followers. Why they are Devils, or Devils instruments. Here are but 2
               parties in the World, the Lamb &amp; his Followers, &amp; the Dragon &amp;
               his Followers: &amp; these are contrary one to to the other. Well now they
               that are against the Lamb, against the Peace &amp; Prosperity of Zion, the
               interest of Christ: They are for the Devil. Here are no Newters. Every one
               is on one side or the other.

            <p class="div2">3. Use. It calls us all (especially those that would be accounted Followers
               of the Lamb) to mourn that the Devil has had so many assistants from amongst
               us, especially that he should find, or make such in our Churches. If so be
               Churches are deeply to mourn the dishonour done to Christ &amp; Religion, by
               Fornicators among them. 1. Cor. 5. 1. &amp;c. how much more, when Witches
               &amp; Wizards are amongst them.

               ever praying that we be not left to our own lusts: for then we shall by
               &amp; by fall in with Devils, &amp; with the Dragon make war with the Lamb
