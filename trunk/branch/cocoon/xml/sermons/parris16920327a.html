            <p class="div2">1. Prop: There are Devils as well as Saints in the Church of Christ: Here 3
               things may be spoken to
            </p>

            <p class="div2">2. That there are such Devils in the Church</p>
            
            
            <p class="div2">3. Last: That there are also true Saints in such Churches</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div3">1. What is meant here by Devils. One of you is a Devil.  An. By
               Devil is ordinarily meant any wicked Angel or Spirit: Sometimes it is
               put for the Prince or head of the evil Spirits, or fallen Angels.
               Sometimes it is used for vile &amp; wicked persons, the worst of such,
               who for their villany &amp; impiety do most resemble Devils &amp; wicked
               Spirits. Thus Christ in our text calls Judas a Devil, for his great
               likeness to the Devil. One of you is a Devil i.e. a Devil for quality
               &amp; disposition: not a Devil for Nature, for he was a man &amp;c. but
               a Devil for likeness &amp; operation. 8. Joh. 38. 41 44. Ye are of your
               Father the Devil
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div3">2. There are such Devils in the Church: Not only sinners but notorious
               sinners; sinners more like to the Devil than others. So here in Christs
               little Church. Text. This also Christ teacheth us in the Parable of the
               Tares. 13. Matth. 38. Where Christ tells us that such are the Children
               of the wicked one. i.e. of the Devil. Reason: Because Hypocrites
               are the very worst of men. Corruptio optimi est pessima. Hypocrites are
               the sons &amp; heirs of the Devil, the free-holders of hell, whereas
               other sinners are but Tenants. When Satan repossesseth a Soul he becomes
               more vile &amp; sinfull. 11. Luke. 24. 25. 26. As the Goaler layes load
               of iron on him that hath escaped. None are worse than those that have
               been good, &amp; are naught: &amp; might be good, but will be
               naught.

            <p class="div3">3. Last: There are also true Saints in the Church. The Church consists of
               good; &amp; bad: as a Garden that has weeds as well as flowers: &amp; as
               a field that has Wheat as well as Tares. Hince the Gosple is compared to
               a net that taketh good &amp; bad. 13. Matt. 47. 48. 49. 50. Here are
               good men to be found, yea ye very best; &amp; here are bad men to be
               found, yea ye very worst: Such as Shall have the hightest seat in glory;
               &amp; such also as shall be cast into the lowest &amp; fiercest flames
               of misery. Saints &amp; Devils. Like Jeremiahs Basket of figs. 24. Jer.
               1-4.

            <p class="div2">2. Prop: Christ knows how many of these Devils there are in his Churches. As
               in our text there was one among the twelve. And so in our Churches God knows
               how many Devils there are: whither 1. 2. 3. or. 4. in 12. How many Devils,
               how many Saints. He that knows whom he has Chosen. 13. John. 18. he also
               knows who they are that have not chosen him, but prefer farms &amp;
               Merchandanize above him, &amp; above his ordinances. 2. Tim. 4. 10
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div2">3. Prop: Last: Christ knows who these Devils are. There is one among you sais
               Christ to the twelve: Well who is that? why it is Judas. Why so Christ knows
               how many Devils among us: whither one of ten, or 20 &amp; also who they are:
               He knows us perfectly; &amp; he knows those of us that are in the Church,
               that we are either Saints of Devils; True believers, or Hypocrites &amp;
               dissembling Judas's that would sell Christ &amp; his kingdom to gratify a
               lust. We do not think we are such. 2 Reg. 8. 12. 13.

            <p class="div2">1. Use. Let none then build their hopes of Salvation meerly upon this, that
               they are Church-members. This you &amp; I may be, &amp; yet Devils for all
               that. 8. Matth. 11. 12. Many shall come from the East and West, &amp; shall
               sit down &amp;c. And however we may pass here a true difference shall be
               made shortly &amp;c.

            <p class="div2">2. Use. Let none then be stumbled at Religion because too often there are
               Devils found among the Saints. You see here was a true Church, Sincere
               converts, &amp; Sound believers, &amp; yet here was a Devil among them.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div2">3. Use. Terror to Hypocrites, who Profess much love to Christ, but indeed are
               in league with their lusts, which they prefer above Christ. Oh remember that
               you are Devils in Christs account. Christ is lightly esteemed of you, &amp;
               you are vilely accounted of by Christ. Oh if there by any such among us, for
               bear to come this day to the Lords Table, least Satan enter more powerfully
               into you. Least whilst the bread be between your teeth, the wrath of the
               Lord come pouring down upon you. 78. Ps. 30. 31.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div2">4. Use Exhort in two branches.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div3">1. To be deeply humbled for the appearances of Devils among our Churches.
               If the Church of Corinth were called to mourn because of one incestuous
               person among them. 1 Cor. 5 initio How much more may N-E Churches mourn
               that such as work witchcraft, or are vehemently suspected so to do
               should be found among them.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div3">2. To be much in prayer that God would deliver our Churches from Devils.
               That God would not suffer Devils in the guise of Saints to associate
               with us. One sinner destroys much good; how much more one Devil. Pray we
               also that not one true Saint may suffer as a Devil, either in name, or
               body. The Devil would represent the best Saints as Devils if he could,
               but it is not easy to imagine that his power is of such extent, to the
               hazard of the Church.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <p class="div2">5. Use. Last: Examine we our selves well, what we are: what we Church-members
               are: We are either Saints, or Devils, the scripture gives us no medium. The
               Apostle tells us we are to examine our selves. 2 Cor. 13. 5. Oh it is a
               dreadful thing to be a Devil, &amp; yet to sit down at the Lords Table. 1
               Cor. 10. 21. Such incurr the hottest of Gods wrath, as follows. 22. v. Now
               if we would not be Devils we must give our selves wholly up to Christ: &amp;
               not suffer the predominancy of one lust, &amp; particularly that lust of
               covetousness, which is made so light of, &amp; which so sadly prevails in
               these perilous times: why this one lust made Judas a Devil. 12. Joh. 6. 26.
               Matth. 15. And no doubt it has made more Devils than one. For a little pelf,
               men sell Christ to his Enemies, &amp; their Souls to the Devil. But there
               are certain sins that make us Devils, see that we be not such
