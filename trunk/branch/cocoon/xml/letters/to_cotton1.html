            To John Cotton DI/AAS 
            <strong>August 5, 1692</strong>
            Reverend Sir,
            
            <p> Our good God is working of miracles. Five witches were lately executed, impudently
               demanding of God a miraculous vindication of their innocency. Immediately upon this,
               our God miraculously sent in five Andover witches, who made a most ample,
               surprising, amazing confession of all their villainies, and declared the five newly
               executed to have been of their company, discovering many more, but all agreeing in
               Burroughs being their ringleader, who, I suppose, this day receives his trial at
               Salem, whither a vast concourse of people is gone, my father this morning among the
               rest. Since those, there have come in other confessors; yea, they come in daily.
               About this prodigious matter my soul has been refreshed with some little short of
               miraculous answers of prayer, which are not to be written; but they comfort me with
               a prospect of a hopeful issue. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p> The whole town yesterday turned the lecture into a fast, kept in our meeting-house;
               God give a good return. But in the morning we were entertained with the horrible
               tidings of the late earthquake at Jamaica, on the 7th of June last. When, on a fair
               day, the sea suddenly swelled, and the earth shook and broke in many places; and in
               a minute�s time, the rich town of Port-Royal, the Tyrus of the whole English
               America, but a very Sodom for wickedness, was immediately swallowed up, and the sea
               came rolling over the town. No less than seventeen-hundred souls of that one town
               are missing, besides other incredible devastations all over the island, where houses
               are demolished, mountains overturned, rocks rent, and all manner of destruction
               inflicted. The Non-conformist minister there escaped wonderfully with his life. Some
               of our poor New England people are lost in the ruins, and others have their bones
               broke. Forty vessels were sunk�namely all whose cables did not break; but no New
               England ones. Behold, an accident speaking to all our English America. I live in
               pains, and want your prayers. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               <em> Bestow them, dear Sir, on Your, </em>
            </p>
