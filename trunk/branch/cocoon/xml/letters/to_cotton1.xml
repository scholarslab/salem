            <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            <p> Our good God is working of miracles. Five witches were lately executed, impudently
                demanding of God a miraculous vindication of their innocency. Immediately upon this,
                our God miraculously sent in five Andover witches, who made a most ample,
                surprising, amazing confession of all their villainies, and declared the five newly
                executed to have been of their company, discovering many more, but all agreeing in
                Burroughs being their ringleader, who, I suppose, this day receives his trial at
                Salem, whither a vast concourse of people is gone, my father this morning among the
                rest. Since those, there have come in other confessors; yea, they come in daily.
                About this prodigious matter my soul has been refreshed with some little short of
                miraculous answers of prayer, which are not to be written; but they comfort me with
                a prospect of a hopeful issue. </p>

            <p> The whole town yesterday turned the lecture into a fast, kept in our meeting-house;
                God give a good return. But in the morning we were entertained with the horrible
                tidings of the late earthquake at Jamaica, on the 7th of June last. When, on a fair
                day, the sea suddenly swelled, and the earth shook and broke in many places; and in
                a minute�s time, the rich town of Port-Royal, the Tyrus of the whole English
                America, but a very Sodom for wickedness, was immediately swallowed up, and the sea
                came rolling over the town. No less than seventeen-hundred souls of that one town
                are missing, besides other incredible devastations all over the island, where houses
                are demolished, mountains overturned, rocks rent, and all manner of destruction
                inflicted. The Non-conformist minister there escaped wonderfully with his life. Some
                of our poor New England people are lost in the ruins, and others have their bones
                broke. Forty vessels were sunk�namely all whose cables did not break; but no New
                England ones. Behold, an accident speaking to all our English America. I live in
                pains, and want your prayers. </p>
