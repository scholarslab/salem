            <h2>To William Stoughton U/* (typed transcript at AAS)
               September 2, 1692
            </h2>

            <p><strong>September 2, 1692</strong></p>
            <p>Honorable Sir,</p>

            <p> I have made the world sensible of my zeal to assist, according unto my poor capacity, the
               weighty and worthy undertakings wherein almighty God has employed Your Honor as His instrument
               for the extinguishing of as wonderful a piece of devilism as has been seen in the world; and yet
               I hope I may say that the one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen. But
               one of my feeble essays that way, I would not use till I have in the first place asked your
               direction, with your countenance. 
            </p>

            <p> I have been extremely sensible of the duty lying upon the ministers of the country to do some
               singular thing in a way of testimony against those evils which lay people most open to the
               present annoyances of the devil, and unto those duties whereto we are now extraordinarily
               obliged. Because others have not hitherto done anything considerable that way, I have myself,
               not without the advice of others, drawn up an address unto my neighbor, on the prodigious
               occasion that is now before us. Throughout the whole of that attempt I would both propound your
               service, and enjoy your conduct. Wherefore, 
            </p>

            <p> I. I have labored to divert the thoughts of my readers, even with something of designed
               contrivance, unto those points which help very much to flatten that fury which we now so much
               turn upon one another. 
            </p>

            <p> II. I would ask Your Honor�s leave that I might give a distinct account of the trials which
               have passed upon some of our malefactors, which being inserted in this treatise will much
               vindicate the country, as well as the judges and juries. 
            </p>

            <p> III. I have not only set our calamity in as true a light as I can, but also, where I have let
               fall, as once or twice, the jealousies among us, of innocent people being accused, I would
               humbly submit all those expressions to Your Honor�s correction, that so there may not be one
               word out of point. In short, I have all along aimed at expressing such a temper as, I believe,
               Your Honor wishes the whole people at this time to be filled withal. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p> IV. To rectify further the opinions of men, as well about the nature of our distress as about
               the justice of your proceedings, I would publish a short narrative of the Swedish story,
               especially those articles of it which most agree with ours. 
            </p>

            <p> V. For me to beg that either Your Honor singly, or the judges jointly, would in a line or two
               signify unto the world that my labors have your approbation, or being not only an agreeable
               account of the calamity now upon us, but also a profitable representation of the duties whereto
               we should apply ourselves on this occasion. 
            </p>

            <p> This were an arrogance whereupon I dare not presume. Although a favor of that kind bestowed
               upon me would somewhat lay before the world an intimation of that holy, pious, fatherly frame of
               spirit, with which you are herein concerned for us, yet, I say, I dare not aspire so far as to
               ask it. I shall think myself highly favored if you do but let me see that you approve my cares
               to sanctify the terrible hand of God, which is now upon us. [Sends along part of The Wonders of
               the Invisible World.] 
            </p>

            <p>
               <em> Your sincere and most humble servant, </em>
