					<p>What say you, are you guilty of witchcraft, of which you are <orig
							reg="suspected">sus- <lb/> pected </orig>, or not? No Sir, I say before
						God, before whom I stand, that <lb/> I know nothing of witchcraft. Who is
						this man? <name type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name> named <lb/>
						him. -- <name type="person" key="walmar">Mary Walcot</name> said she had
						seen his shape. What do you say to <lb/> this? I never did hurt them. Who
						hurt you <name type="person" key="puann2">Ann Putman</name> ? That man.
						<lb/> I never hurt her. <name type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name>
						said, he is upon the beam. Just such a <lb/> discovery of the person carried
						out, and she confessed; and if you <lb/> would find mercy of God, you must
						confess. -- If I should confess <lb/> this, I must confess what is false.
						Tell how far you have gone, who <lb/> hurts you? I do not know, I am
						absolutely free. As you say, God <lb/> knows. If you will confess the truth,
						we desire nothing else that you <lb/> may not hide you guilt, if you are
						guilty, and therefore confess if so. <lb/> I speak before God that I am
						clear from this accusation. What, in all <lb/> respects? Yes in all
						respects. Doth this man hurt you? Their mouths <lb/> were stopped. You hear
						several accuse you, though one cannot open <lb/> her mouth. I am altogether
						free. Charge him not unless it be he. This <lb/> is the man say some, and
						some say he is very like him. How did you <lb/> know his name? He did not
						tell me himself, but other witches told <lb/> me. Ann Putman said, it is the
						same man, and then she was taken with <lb/> a fit. <name type="person"
							key="walmar">Mary Walcot</name> , is this the man? He is like him, I
						cannot say it is <lb/> he. <name type="person" key="lewmer">Mercy

						bunch on his eyes. <name type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name> , in
						a fit, said, be you the man? ay, <lb/> do you say you be the man? did you
						put a mist before my eyes? <lb/> Then he was sent forth till several others
						were examined. When he was <lb/> brought in again, by reason of much people,
						and many in the <orig reg="windows">win- <lb/> dows </orig> so that the

						pointed several <lb/> times at one <name type="person" key="hilzeb">Captain

						had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he <lb/> stooped down to her

							<name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> afflicted <lb/> her; one

					<p>Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring <lb/> was

					<p>The Accusers cried out that <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> did

						<name type="person" key="gidbar">Mr. Gidney</name> bid <name type="person"

						would recall <lb/> that judgment again, and added that he hoped that he

						<lb/> to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her]

					<p>The said <name type="person" key="trasar">Trask</name> when recovered as I

						sometimes <lb/> better sometimes worse unto her death, manifesting that shee
						under <lb/> temptation to kill her selfe or somebody else. </p>
					<p>I enquired of <name type="person" key="rinmar">Marg'rt Ring</name> who kept
						at or nigh the house, what <lb/> shee had observed of s'd <name
							type="person" key="trasar">Trask</name> before this last distraction

					<p>The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house <lb/> she[e]

					<p>I was oft praying w'th &amp; councelling of <name type="person"

						earnestly desired <name type="person" key="bisedw2">Edw: Bishop</name> might

					<p>Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in <lb/> those

					<p>After most humble and hearty thanks presented to your Honors <lb/> for the
						great care and pains you have already taken for us, for which <lb/> we are
						never able to make you recompense (and we believe you do <lb/> not expect it
						of us; therefore a full reward will be given you of the <lb/> Lord God of
						Israel, whose cause and interest you have espoused, <lb/> and we trust this
						shall add to your crown of glory in the day of the <lb/> Lord Jesus); and
						we, beholding continually the tremendous works of <lb/> divine providence --
						not only every day but every hour -- thought <lb/> it our duty to inform
						your Honors of what we conceive you have <lb/> not heard, which are high and
						dreadful: of a wheel within a wheel, <lb/> at which our ears do tingle. </p>
					<p>Humbly craving continually your prayers and help in this <orig
							reg="distressed">dis- <lb/> tressed </orig> case, so praying almighty
						God continually to prepare you, <lb/>
						<pb n="166"/> that you may be a terror to evil-doers and a praise to them
						that do <lb/> well, we remain yours to serve in what we are able. </p>

						set your hand to <lb/> it? A. I touched it with my fingers and the book was
						red, the paper <lb/>
						<pb n="202"/> of it was white. She said she never had seen the black man;

						<lb/> A. A black dog. Q. Did the dog ever come to you? A. No. Q. But <lb/>
						you said you saw a cat once. What did that say to you? A. It said <lb/> it
						would tear me in pieces if I would not set my hand to the book. <lb/> She
						said her mother baptized her, and the devil or black man was <lb/> not
						there, as she saw, and her mother said when she baptized her, <lb/> thou are
						mine for ever and ever and amen. Q. How did you afflict <lb/> folks? A. I
						pinched them, and she said she had no puppets, but <lb/> she went to them
						that she afflicted. Being asked whether she went in <lb/> her body or her
						spirit, she said in her spirit. She said her mother <lb/> carried her
						thither to afflict. Q. How did your mother carry you <lb/> when she was in
						prison? A. She came like a black cat. Q. How did <lb/> you know that it was
						your mother? A. The cat told me so that she <lb/> was my mother. She said

					<head>( <name type="person" key="carnat">Nathaniel Cary's</name> Account of his

					<p>I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused of <orig reg="Witchcraft"
							>Witch- <lb/> craft </orig>, being much disturbed at it, by advice, we
						went to <orig reg="Salem-Village">Salem- <lb/> Village </orig>, to see if
						the afflicted did know her; we arrived there, 24 May, it happened to be a
						day appointed for Examination; <orig reg="accordingly">accord- <lb/> ingly
						</orig> soon after our arrival, <name type="person" key="hawjoh">Mr.
						Hathorn</name> and <name type="person" key="corjoh">Mr. Curwin</name> ,
						etc., went <lb/> to the Meeting-house, which was the place appointed for
						that Work, <lb/> the Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care to
						get a <lb/> convenient place, I observed, that the afflicted were two Girls
						of <lb/> about Ten Years old, and about two or three other, of about <orig
							reg="eighteen">eight- <lb/> een </orig>, one of the Girls talked most,
						and could discern more than the <lb/> rest. The Prisoners were called in one
						by one, and as they came in <lb/> were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was
						placed about 7 or 8 foot <lb/> from the Justices, and the Accusers between
						the Justices and them; <lb/> the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before
						the Justices, with an <lb/>
						<pb n="208"/> Officer appointed to hold each hand, least they should
						therewith <lb/> afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be constantly on
						the <orig reg="Justices">Jus- <lb/> tices </orig>; for if they look'd on the
						afflicted, they would either fall into <lb/> their Fits, or cry out of being
						hurt by them; after Examination of <lb/> the Prisoners, who it was afflicted
						these Girls, etc., they were put <lb/> upon saying the Lords Prayer, as a
						tryal of their guilt; after the <lb/> afflicted seem'd to be out of their
						Fits, they would look steadfastly <lb/> on some one person, and frequently
						not speak; and then the Justices <lb/> said they were struck dumb, and after
						a little time would speak again; <lb/> then the Justices said to the
						Accusers, “which of you will go and <lb/> touch the Prisoner at the Bar?”
						then the most couragious would <orig reg="adventure">ad- <lb/> venture
						</orig>, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall <lb/>
						down as in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up <lb/>
						and carried to the Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon <lb/> as
						they were touched by the accused, the Justices would say, they are <lb/>
						well, before I could discern any alteration; by which I observed that <lb/>
						the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus far I was only as <lb/> a
						Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but no notice <lb/>
						taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her <lb/>
						and asked her name. </p>
					<p>But I having an opportunity to Discourse <name type="person" key="haljoh">Mr.
							Hale</name> (with whom <lb/> I had formerly acquaintance) I took his
						advice, what I had best to <lb/> do, and desired of him that I might have an
						opportunity to speak <lb/> with her that accused my Wife; which he promised
						should be, I <lb/> acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him. </p>
					<p>Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over, <lb/> and told me I
						had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser, <lb/>
						<hi rend="italics">viz </hi>. <name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail
							Williams</name> , a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old; but that we could <lb/>
						not be in private at <name type="person" key="parsam">Mr. Parris's</name>
						House, as he had promised me; we <lb/> went therefore into the Alehouse,
						where an Indian Man attended us, <lb/> who it seems was one of the
						afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, <lb/> he shewed several Scars, that
						seemed as if they had been long there, <lb/> and shewed them as done by
						Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his <lb/> Wife, who also was a Slave, was
						imprison'd for Witchcraft. And now <lb/> instead of one Accuser, they all
						came in, who began to tumble down <lb/> like Swine, and then three Women
						were called in to attend them. <lb/> We in the Room were all at a stand, to
						see who they would cry <lb/> out of; but in a short time they cried out,
							<name type="person" key="careli2">Cary</name> ; and immediately <lb/>
						<pb n="209"/> after a Warrant was sent from the Justices to bring my Wife
						before <lb/> them, who were sitting in a Chamber near by, waiting for this. </p>
					<p>Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two <lb/> Girls;
						my Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any <orig
							reg="knowledge">knowl- <lb/> edge </orig> of them before that day; she
						was forced to stand with her <lb/> Arms stretched out. I did request that I
						might hold one of her <lb/> hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me
						to wipe the Tears <lb/> from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I
						did; then she <lb/> desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she
						should faint. </p>
					<p>Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment <lb/> those
						persons, and she should have strength enough to stand. I <lb/> speaking
						something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded <lb/> me to be
						silent, or else I should be turned out of the Room. The <lb/> Indian before
						mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her <lb/> Accusers: being come
						in, he now (when before the Justices) fell <lb/> down and tumbled about like
						a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices <lb/> asked the Girls, who afflicted
						the Indian? they answered she ( <orig reg="meaning">mean- <lb/> ing </orig>
						my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices ordered her to touch <lb/> him,
						in order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way, <lb/> least
						instead of curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on <lb/> him,
						her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took <lb/> hold on
						her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous <lb/> manner;
						then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and <lb/> the cure was
						quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their <lb/> Inhumane
						dealings, uttered a hasty Speech (That God would take <lb/> vengeance on
						them, and desired that God would deliver us out of the <lb/> hands of
						unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with <lb/> difficulty and
						charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it; <lb/> if there had,
						could have taken but little rest that Night. She was <lb/> committed to
						Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to <lb/> remove her to
						Cambridge Prison, which is in our County of <orig reg="Middlesex">Middle-
							<lb/> sex </orig>. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor
						put <lb/> Irons on her legs (having received such a command) the weight of
						<lb/> them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions,
						<lb/> soon brought her into Convulsion Fits, so that I thought she would
						<lb/> have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken
						<lb/> off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her Life,
						<lb/> so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem <lb/>
						<pb n="210"/> coming on, I went thither, to see how things were there
						managed; <lb/> and finding that the <orig reg="Specter"
						>Spectre</orig>-Evidence was there received, together <lb/> with Idle, if
						not malicious Stories, against Peoples Lives, I did easily <lb/> perceive
						which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that <lb/> served for
						one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her <lb/> danger;
						and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she <lb/> would
						never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal <lb/> in our own
						County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for <lb/> it, and were
						put in hopes of it; but I soon saw so much, that I <orig reg="understood"
							>under- <lb/> stood </orig> thereby it was not intended, which put me
						upon consulting <lb/> the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of
						God was <orig reg="effected">ef- <lb/> fected </orig>, and she got to Road
						Island, but soon found her self not safe <lb/> when there, by reason of the
						pursuit after her; from thence she <lb/> went to New-York, along with some
						others that had escaped their <lb/> cruel hands; where we found his
						Excellency <name type="person" key="fleben">Benjamin Fletcher</name> , <lb/>
						Esq; Governour, who was very courteous to us. After this some of <lb/> my
						Goods were seized in a Friends hands, with whom I had left them, <lb/> and
						my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a <lb/> day, and
						then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners, <lb/> and their
						Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution, <lb/> no sober
						Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; <lb/> which is
						the more, considering what a People for Religion, I mean <lb/> the
						profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of <lb/> them
						Church-Members, and most of them unspotted in their <orig reg="Conversation"
							>Con- <lb/> versation </orig>, till their Adversary the Devil took up
						this Method for <lb/> accusing them. </p>

						<name type="person" key="endzer">Dr. Zorobbabel Endicot</name> ; who found
						the man bruised to Death, and <lb/> having clodders of Blood about his
						Heart. The Jury, whereof <orig reg="several">sev- <lb/> eral </orig> are yet

					<p>
						<name type="person" key="corgil">Giles Cory</name>, you are brought before

						the<lb/> truth in this matter.</p>
					<p> I hope through the goodness of God I shall, for that<lb/> matter I never had
						no hand in, in my life.<lb/> Which of you have seen this man hurt you?<lb/>
						<name type="person" key="walmar">Mary Wolcott</name>, <name type="person"

					<p> Hath he hurt you too? speaking to <name type="person" key="hubeli">Elizabeth

						<name type="person" key="gouben">Benjamin Gold</name>, hath he hurt
						you?<lb/> I have seen him several times, and been hurt after it,<lb/> but
						cannot affirm that it was he.<lb/> Hath he brought the book to any of you?<lb/>
						<name type="person" key="walmar">Mary Wolcott</name> and <name type="person"
							key="wilabi">Abigail Williams</name> and others affirmed<lb/> he had
						brought the book to them.</p>
					<p>
						<name type="person" key="corgil">Giles Cory</name>, they accuse you, or your
						appearance, of <lb/> hurting them, and bringing the book to them. What
						do<lb/> you say? Why do you hurt them? Tell us the truth.<lb/> I never did
						hurt them.<lb/> It is your appearance hurts them, they charge you; tell<lb/>
						us what you have done.<lb/> I have done nothing to damage them.</p>
					<p> Have you ever entered into contract with the devil?<lb/> I never did.<lb/>
						What temptations have you had?<lb/> I never had temptations in my life.<lb/>
						What, have you done it without temptations?</p>
					<p> What was the reason (said <name type="person" key="bibsar">goodwife
						Bibber</name>) that you<lb/> were frighted in the cow-house? and then the
						questionist<lb/> was suddenly seized with a violent fit.</p>
					<p>
						<name type="person" key="brasam">Samuel Braybrook</name>, <name
							type="person" key="bibjoh">goodman Bibber</name>, and his daughter,<lb/>
						testified that he had told them this morning that he was<lb/> frighted in
						the cow-house.<lb/>
						<name type="person" key="corgil">Cory</name> denied it.<lb/> This was not
						your appearance but your person, and you<lb/> told them so this morning: why
						do you deny it?<lb/> What did you see in the cow-house?<lb/> I never saw
						nothing but my cattle.<lb/> Divers witnessed that he told them he was
						frighted.<lb/> Well, what do you say to these witnesses? What was<lb/> it
						frighted you?<lb/> I do not know that ever I spoke the word in my life.<lb/>
						Tell the truth, what was it frighted you?<lb/> I do not know any thing that
						frighted me.</p>
					<p> All the afflicted were seized now with fits, and troubled<lb/> with pinches.
						Then the court ordered his hands to be tied.<lb/> What, is it not enough to
						act witchcraft at other times,<lb/> but must you do it now in the face of
						authority?<lb/> I am a poor creature, and cannot help it.<lb/> Upon the
						motion of his head again, they had their heads<lb/> and necks afflicted.</p>
					<p> Why do you tell such wicked lies against witnesses, that<lb/> heard you
						speak after this manner, this very morning?<lb/> I never saw any thing but a
						black hog.<lb/> You said that you were stopt once in prayer; what<lb/> stopt
						you?<lb/> I cannot tell; my wife came towards me and found fault<lb/> with
						me for saying living to God and dying to sin.</p>
					<p> What was it frighted you in the barn?<lb/> I know nothing frighted me
						there.<lb/> Why here are three witnesses that heard you say so<lb/>
						to-day.<lb/> I do not remember it.</p>
					<p>
						<name type="person" key="goutho">Thomas Gold</name> testified that he heard
						him say, that he<lb/> knew enough against his wife, that would do her
						business.<lb/> What was it that you knew against your wife?<lb/> Why that of
						living to God, and dying to sin.<lb/> The Marshal and Bibber's daughter
						confirmed the same,<lb/> that he said he could say that that would do his
						wife's<lb/> business.</p>
					<p> I have said what I can say to that.<lb/> What was that about your ox?<lb/> I
						thought he was hipt.</p>
					<p> What ointment was that your wife had when she was<lb/> seized? You said it
						was ointment she made by <name type="person" key="gidbar">major<lb/>
							Gidney's</name> direction.<lb/> He denied it, and said she had it of
							<name type="person" key="bibsar">goody Bibber</name>, or<lb/> from her direction.<lb/>
						<name type="person" key="bibsar">Goody Bibber</name> said it is not like
						that ointment.<lb/> You said you knew, upon your own knowledge, that
						she<lb/> had it of <name type="person" key="gidbar">major
						Gidney</name>.<lb/> He denied it.</p>
					<p> Did not you say, when you went to the ferry with your<lb/> wife, you would
						not go over to Boston now, for you should<lb/> come yourself the next
						week?<lb/> I would not go over, because I had not money.<lb/> The Marshal
						testified he said as before.</p>
					<p> One of his hands was let go, and several were afflicted.<lb/> He held his
						head on one side, and then the heads of seve-<lb/> ral of the afflicted were
						held on one side. He drew in<lb/> his cheeks, and the cheeks of some of the
						afflicted were<lb/> suckt in.</p>
					<p>
						<name type="person" key="bibjoh">John Bibber</name> and his <name
							type="person" key="bibsar">wife</name> gave testimony concerning<lb/>
						some temptations he had to make away with himself.<lb/> How doth this agree
						with what you said, that you had<lb/> no temptations?<lb/> I meant
						temptation to witchcraft.<lb/> If you can give away to self murther, that
						will make way<lb/> to temptation to witchcraft.</p>
					<p> Note. There was witness by several, that he said he<lb/> would make away
						with himself, and charge his death up-<lb/> on his son.<lb/>
						<name type="person" key="bibsar">Goody Bibber</name> testified that the said
							<name type="person" key="corgil">Cory</name> called said<lb/> Bibber's
						husband, damn'd, devilish rogue.<lb/> Other vile expressions testified in
						open court by several<lb/> others.</p>

					<p>we had a great deal of talke with her about the complaint that was <lb/> of
