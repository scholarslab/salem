						mouth would be Stopt but sometymes she had been helped to say Lord be merce
						full to me a sinner. Being again asked how far she had yeilded to Satan she
						said the Devil promised her she should not be discovered and if she was
						discovered &amp; brought down that she should goe home Innocent
						&amp; cleare but now find he has deluded her. Being again asked how long
						it is since saten furst wrought with her in this manner she said she could
						not well tell how long but thinks it is not two years. And confesses that
						she went In her Spirit <name type="person" key="swatim">[to Timo'
						Swans]</name> and did often think of him &amp; <pb n="768"/> her hands
						would be clinched, and that she would grip the dishclout or anything else
						and so think of the person; And by this &amp; afflicting of others since
						She came down she is convinced she is a witch -- she saith now, the Devil
						appeared to her in the shape of a Tawny man and promised to keep her from
						the Indians and she should have happy dayes with her sone -- she was asked
						if she did not signe the <orig reg="Devil's book">Devills book</orig>;
						answered he brought something which she [took] to bee a piece of burch bark
						and she made a mark with her finger by rubbing off the whit Scurff. And he
						promised if she would serve him she should be safe from the Indians (she was
						then a litle stopt again &amp; believed it was the Devil that did it)//
						Being asked if the Devil did not say she was to serve him Answered Yes, and
						signed the mark upon that condition and was to praise him w'h her whole
						heart, and twas to that appearance she prayed at all tymes for he said he
						was able to delyver her from the Indians And it was the feare of the Indians
						that put her upon it. she confesses she hurt <name type="person"
							key="swatim">Timothy Swan</name> and thinks she was twice at salem
						Village witch meeting and that <name type="person" key="brisar">Goody

						[seald] it was to the Devil) That if she should Dye upon the Gallowse yet
						she would not say any thing but that she was Innocent. &amp; rejoyced In

							key="brisar">Goody Bridges</name> (who had confessed before) urged her
						also to confess she had then no remembrance of this but with the justices
						Discourse and the help of god it came into her mind. she saith she thought
						that that appearance was God her creator &amp; being asked if she did
						not know otherwise answered The Devil is so subtel that when she would
						confess he stops her and deludes also by scripture and being asked what
						scripture he made inser of to her she mentioned that in the Psalmes where it
						is said Let my enemies be confounded, And so she had wished them all
						Destroyed that raised such reports of her she confesses that her sister was

					<p>Goodwife <name type="person" key="tylmar">Tyler </name> did say, that, when
						she was first apprehended, she had no fears upon her, and did think that
						nothing could have made her confess against herself. But since, she had
						found, to her great grief, that she had wronged the truth, and falsely
						accused herself. She said that, when she was brought to Salem, her brother
							<name type="person" key="brijoh">Bridges</name> rode with her; and that,
						all along the way from Andover to Salem, her brother kept telling her that
						she must needs be a witch, since the afflicted accused her, and at her touch
						were raised out of their fits, and urging her to confess herself a witch.
						She as constantly told him that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of
						witchcraft, and begged him not to urge her to confess. However, when she
						came to Salem, she was carried to a room, where her brother on one side, and
							<name type="person" key="emejoh">Mr. John Emerson</name> on the other
						side, did tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the
						Devil before her eyes at that time (and, accordingly, the said <name

						beat him away from her eyes); and they so urged her to confess, that she
						wished herself in any dungeon, rather than be so treated. <name
							type="person" key="emejoh">Mr. Emerson</name> told her, once and again,
						`Well, I see you will not confess! Well, I will now leave you; and then you
						are undone, body and soul, for ever.' Her brother urged her to confess, and
						told her that, in so doing, she could not lie: to which she answered, `Good
						brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if I confess, and then who shall
						answer unto God for my lie?' He still asserted it, and said that God would
						not suffer so many good men to be in such an error about it, and that she
						would be hanged if she did not confess; and continued so long and so
						violently to urge and press her to confess, that she thought, verily, that
						her life would have gone from her, and became so terrified in her mind that
						she <pb n="778"/> owned, at length, almost any thing that they propounded to
						her; that she had wronged her conscience in so doing; she was guilty of a
						great sin in belying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long as she
						lived. This she said, and a great deal more of the like nature; and all with
						such affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it exceeds
						any pen to describe and express the same. </p>

						no sooner turned his face to her but shee fel into a dreadful fit again, and

						Moreover the said <name type="person" key="corgil">Cory</name> in prison

						charged with Witchcraft when he was at first complained of by the afflicted

						going from home, &amp; could not stay, but if I could come home before
						night I should not be unwilling, but it was near night before I came home
						&amp; so I did not answere his desire, but I heard no more of him upon
						that account. Whither my not answering his desire did not offend him, I
						cannot tell, but I was jealous afterwards that it did. A little after my
						wife &amp; I went to Boston at the last Election, when I was as well in
						health as in many yeares before, &amp; the Election day coming to my

						so that I could not dine, nor eat any thing, I cannot express the misery I
						was in for my water was sodainly stopt, &amp; I had no benefit of
						nature, but was like a man on a Rack, &amp; I told my wife immediately
						that I was afraid that <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">Willard </name> had
						done me wrong, my pain continuing &amp; finding no relief my jealousie
						continued: <name type="person" key="lawsmr">Mr Lawson, </name> &amp;
						others there, were all amazed, &amp; knew not what to do for me: There
						was a Woman accounted <pb n="848"/> skilfull came hoping to help me,

						persons had done me damage. I said, I could not say they had, but I was sore
						afraid they had, she answered she did fear so too, as near as I remember. I
						lay in this case. 3. or. 4. dayes at Boston, &amp; afterwards with the
						jeopardy of my life (as I thought) I came home, &amp; then some of my
						friends coming to see me (&amp; at this time <name type="person"

						was in chains, &amp; then as near as I can guess I had considerable

						<p>When I first arrived I found this Province miserably harrassed with a
							most Horrible witchcraft or Possession of <orig reg="Devils"
							>Devills</orig> which had broke in upon severall Townes, some scores of
							poor people were taken with preternaturall torments some scalded with
							brimstone some had pins stuck in their flesh others hurried into the
							fire and water and some dragged out of their houses and carried over the
							tops of trees and hills for many Miles together; it hath been
							represented to mee much like that of Sweden about thirty years agoe, and
							there were many committed to prison upon suspicion of Witchcraft before
							my arrivall. The loud cries and clamours of the friends of the afflicted
							people with the advice of the Deputy Governor and many others prevailed
							with mee to give a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering what
							witchcraft might be at the bottome or whether it were not a possession.
							The chief Judge in this Commission was the Deputy Governour and the rest
							were persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched
							upon. When the Court came to sitt at Salem in the County of Essex they
							convicted more than twenty persons of being guilty of witchcraft, some
							of the convicted were such as confessed their Guilt, the Court as I
							understand began their proceedings with the accusations of the afflicted
							and then went upon other humane evidences to strengthen that. I was
							almost the whole time of the proceeding abroad in the service of Their
							Majesties in the Eastern part of the County and depended upon the
							Judgment of the Court as to a right method of proceeding in cases of
							Witchcraft but when I came home I found many persons in a strange
							ferment of dissatisfaction which was increased by some hott Spiritts
							that blew up the flame, but on enquiring into the matter I found that
							the <pb n="862"/>
							<orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> had taken upon him the name and shape of
							severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain knowledge
							of good reputation for which cause I have now forbidden the committing
							of any more that shall be accused without unavoydable necessity, and
							those that have been committed I would shelter from any Proceedings
							against them wherein there may be the least suspition of any wrong to be
							done unto the Innocent. I would also wait for any particular directions
							or commands if their Majesties please to give mee any for the fuller
							ordering this perplexed affair. I have also put a stop to the printing
							of any discourses one way or other, that may increase the needless
							disputes of people upon this occasion, because I saw a likelyhood of
							kindling an inextinguishable flame if I should admitt any publique and
							open Contests and I have grieved to see that some who should have done
							their Majesties and this Province better service have so far taken
							Councill of Passion as to desire the precipitancy of these matters,
							these things have been improved by some to give me many interuptions in
							their Majesties service and in truth none of my vexations have been
							greater than this, than that their majesties service has been hereby
							unhappily clogged, and the Persons who have made soe ill improvement of
							these matters here are seeking to turne it all upon mee, but I hereby
							declare that as soon as I came from fighting against their Majesties
							Enemyes and understood what danger some of their innocent subjects might
							be exposed to, if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did
							prevaile either to the committing or trying any of them, I did before
							any application was made unto me about it put a stop to the proceedings
							of the Court and they are now stopt till their Majesties pleasure be
							known. Sir I beg pardon for giving you all this trouble, the reason is
							because I know my enemies are seeking to turn it all upon me and I take
							this liberty because I depend upon your friendship, and desire you will
							please to give a true understanding of the matter if any thing of this
							kind be urged or made use of against mee. Because the justnesse of my
							proceeding herein will bee a sufficient defence. Sir </p>

						<p>By the Capn. of the Samuell and Henry <!-- Comment: --> I gave an account
							that att my arrival here I found the Prisons full of people committed
							upon suspition of witchcraft and that continuall complaints were made to
							me that many persons were grievously tormented by witches and that they
							cryed out upon severall persons by name, as the cause of their torments.
							The number of these complaints increasing every day, by advice of the
							Lieut Govr. and the Councill I gave a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to
							try the suspected witches and at that time the generality of the people
							represented to me as reall witchcraft and gave very strange instances of
							the same. The first in Commission was the Lieut. Govr. and the rest
							persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon
							and I depended upon the Court for a right method of proceeding in cases
							of witchcraft. At that time I went to command the army at the Eastern
							part of the Province, for the French and Indians had made an attack upon
							some of our Fronteer Towns. I continued there for some time but when I
							returned I <pb n="864"/> found people much disatisfied at the
							proceedings of the Court, for about Twenty persons were condemned and
							executed of which number some were thought by many persons to be
							innocent. The Court still proceeded in the same method of trying them,
							which was by the evidence of the afflicted persons who when they were
							brought into the Court as soon as the suspected witches looked upon them
							instantly fell to the ground in strange agonies and grievous torments,
							but when touched by them upon the arme or some other part of their flesh
							they immediately revived and came to themselves, upon [which] they made
							oath that the Prisoner at the Bar did afflict them and that they saw
							their shape or <orig reg="specter">spectre</orig> come from their bodies
							which put them to such paines and torments: When I enquired into the
							matter I was enformed by the Judges that they begun with this, but had
							humane testimony against such as were condemned and undoubted proof of
							their being witches, but at length I found that the <orig reg="Devil"
								>Devill</orig> did take upon him the shape of Innocent persons and
							some were accused of whose innocency I was well assured and many
							considerable persons of unblameable life and conversation were cried out
							upon as witches and wizards. The Deputy Govr. notwithstanding persisted
							vigorously in the same method, to the great disatisfaction and
							disturbance of the people, untill I put an end to the Court and stopped
							the proceedings, which I did because I saw many innocent persons might
							otherwise perish and at that time I thought it my duty to give an
							account thereof that their Ma'ties pleasure might be signifyed, hoping
							that for the better ordering thereof the Judges learned in the law in
							England might give such rules and directions as have been practized in
							England for proceedings in so difficult and so nice a point; When I put
							an end to the Court there ware at least fifty persons in prison in great
							misery by reason of the extream cold and their poverty, most of them
							having only <orig reg="specter">spectre</orig> evidence against them,
							and their mittimusses being defective, I caused some of them to be lett
							out upon bayle and put the Judges upon considering of a way to reliefe
							others and prevent them from perishing in prison, upon which some of
							them were convinced and acknowledged that their former proceedings were
							too violent and not grounded upon a right foundation but that if they
							might sit againe, they would proceed after another method, and whereas
								<name type="person" key="matinc">Mr. Increase Mathew</name> and
							severall other Divines did give it as their Judgment that the <orig
								reg="Devil">Devill</orig> might afflict in the shape of an innocent
							person and that the look and touch of the suspected persons was not
							sufficient proofe against them, these things had not the same stress
							layd upon them as before, and upon <pb n="865"/> this consideration I
							permitted a spetiall Superior Court to be held at Salem in the County of
							Essex on the third day of January, the Lieut Govr. being Chief Judge.
							Their method of proceeding being altered, all that were brought to
							tryall to the number of fifety two, were cleared saving three, and I was
							enformed by the Kings Attorny Generall that some of the cleared and the
							condemned were under the same circumstances or that there was the same
							reason to clear the three condemned as the rest according to his
							Judgment. The Deputy Govr. signed a Warrant for their speedy execution
							and also of five others who were condemned at the former Court of Oyer
							and terminer, but considering how the matter had been managed I sent a
							reprieve whereby the execucion was stopped untill their Maj. pleasure be
							signified and declared. The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was inraged
							and filled with passionate anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a
							Superior Court then held at Charles Towne, and indeed hath from the
							beginning hurried on these matters with great precipitancy and by his
							warrant hath caused the estates, goods and chattles of the executed to
							be seized and disposed of without my knowledge or consent. The stop put
							to the first method of proceedings hath dissipated the blak cloud that
							threatened this Province with destruccion; for whereas this delusion of
							the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> did spread and its dismall effects
							touched the lives and estates of many of their Ma'ties Subjects and the
							reputation of some of the principall persons here, and indeed unhappily
							clogged and interrupted their Ma'ties affaires which hath been a great
							vexation to me, I have no new complaints but peoples minds before
							divided and distracted by differing opinions concerning this matter are
							now well composed. </p>

								<name type="recipient">To his Excellency the Governour, and
									Councill, &amp; Representatives, now Assembled at Boston.
									The Humble Address of the ministers, and of some of the
									Inhabitants of Andover. </name>
							</dateline>
						</opener>
						<p>We being deeply sensible of the heavy judgment that the Righteous God
							hath brought upon this place, thought it our duty (after our earnest
							prayers to the God of Heaven, to give us help from our trouble) to lay
							before this Honourable Assembly, our present distressed estate, and to
							crave a redress of our greivances. It is well known that many persons of
							this Town, have been accused of witchcraft, by some distempered persons
							in these parts and upon complaint made have been apprehended and
							committed to prison. Now though we would not appear as Advocates for any
							who shall be found guilty <pb n="877"/> of so horrid a crime, but we
							heartily desire that this place, and the whole land, may be purged from
							that great wickedness: yet if any of our #[freinds] friends and
							neighbours have been misrepresented, as tis possible some of them have
							been; wee would crave leave (if it might be without offence) to speak
							something in their behalf, haveing no other desighn therein, then that
							the truth may appear. We can truly give this Testimony of the most of
							them belonging to this Town, that have been accused, that they never
							gave the least occasion (as we hear of) to their neerest relations or
							most intimate acquaintance, to suspect them of witchcraft. Severall of
							the women that are accused were members of this church in full
							Communion, and had obtained a good report, for their blameless
							conversation, and their walking as becometh woemen professing godliness.
							But whereas it may be alledged, that the most of our people that have
							been apprehended for witchcraft, have upon Examination confessed it. To
							which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for those that freely and
							upon conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend the case of some
							of them to be otherwise. for from the information we have had and the
							discourse some of us have had with the prisoners, we have reason to
							think that the extream urgency that was used with some of them by their
							friends and others who privately examined them, and the fear they were
							then under, hath been an inducement to them to own such things, as we
							cannott since find thay are conscious of; and the truth of what we now
							declare, we judge will in time more plainly appear. And some of them
							have exprest to their neighbours that it hath been their great trouble,
							that they have wronged themselves and the truth in their confessions. </p>
						<p>We are also very sensible of the disstressed condition of severall poor
							familyes, on whom this great trouble is fallen; some #[more] of our
							neighbors are like to be impoverished &amp; ruin'd by the great
							charge they are at to maintain such of their familyes as are in Prison,
							and by the fees that are demanded of them, whose case we pray may be
							considered. </p>
						<p>Our troubles which hitherto have been great, we foresee are like to
							continue and increase, if other methods be not taken then as yet have
							been, for there are more of our neighb'rs of good reputation &amp;
							approved integrity, who are still accused, and complaints have been made
							against them, And we know not who can think himself safe, if the
							Accusations of children and others who are under a Diabolicall influence
							shall be received against persons of good fame. </p>
						<pb n="878"/>
						<p> </p>
						<p>We thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good creditt
							among our selves, but some Honorable &amp; worthy men of other
							places, do suffer in their names by the acusations of afflicted people
							in this Town </p>
						<p>Thus haveing given your Honors some account of our present troubles, we
							crave pardon for our boldness in this Address, and humbly pray this
							Honored Court to take into their serious consideration our low and
							distressed estate: And that the only wise God may bless yo'r counsels
							&amp; Endeavors for the welfare of his people, shall be the prayer

						<p>The Address of severall Ministers of the County of Essex. </p>
						<p>Whereas in the year 1692 some of our neighbours of a good conversation,
							were apprehended and imprisoned upon suspition of Witchcraft, upon the
							complaint of some young persons under Diabolicall molestations; and upon
							their Tryall at the Court at Salem were condemned; great weight being
							layd upon the evidence of the Afflicted persons, their Accusers Sentence
							of Death was Executed on severall of them, others were Reprieved. But
							since it is apparent and hath been Acknowledged, that there were Errors
							and mistakes in the aforesaid Tryalls; and notwithstanding the care and
							conscientious endeavour of the Honorable Judges to do the thing that is
							right: yet there is great reason to fear that Innocent persons then
							suffered, and that God may have a controversy with the Land upon that
							account. </p>
						<p>We would therefore humbly propose to the consideration of this Honored

						<p>We whose names are under-written, inhabitants of Andover; whenas that
							horrible and tremendous judgment beginning at Salem village in the year
							1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at <name
								type="person" key="parsam">Mr. Parris's</name> house, several young
							persons, being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for
							afflicting them, and many there believing it so to be, we being informed
							that, if a person was sick, the afflicted person could tell what or who
							was the cause of that sickness: <name type="person" key="baljos">Joseph
								Ballard</name> , of Andover, his wife being sick at the same time,
							he, either from himself or by the advice of others, fetched two of the
							persons, called the afflicted persons, from Salem village to Andover,
							which was the beginning of that dreadful calamity that befel us in
							Andover, believing the said accusations to be true, sent for the said
							persons to come together to the meeting house in Andover, the afflicted
							persons being there. After <name type="person" key="bartho1">Mr.
							Barnard</name> had been at prayer, we were blindfolded, and our hands
							were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their fits and
							falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as they said;
							and some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they
							were well, and that we were guilty of afflicting them: Whereupon, we
							were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the Justice of the
							peace and forthwith carried to Salem. And, by reason of that sudden
							surprizal, we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime, we
							were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated and
							affrighted even out of our reason. and our nearest and dearest
							relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great
							danger, apprehended there was no other way to save our lives, as the
							case was then circumstanced, but by our confessing ourselves to be such
							and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be, they, out of
							tenderness and pity, persuaded us to confess what we did confess. And
							indeed that confession, that it is said we made, was no other than what
							was suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we were
							witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it
							was so; and our understandings, our reason, our faculties, almost gone,
							we were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the hard
							measures they used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence,
							but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and most of what
							we said, was but, in effect, a consenting to what they said. Some time
							after, when we were better composed, they <pb n="972"/> telling us what
							we had confessed, we did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of
							such things; and we hearing that <name type="person" key="warsam">Samuel
								Wardwell</name> had renounced his confession, and quickly after
							condemned and executed, some of us were told we were going after
							Wardwell. </p>

						<p>To the Honored committee appointed by the Honored Generall Court (to make

							Relict of <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">John Willard</name> Late of
							Salem who suffered death in that hour of the power of darkness as if he
							had been guilty of one of the greatest of crimes that ever any of the
							Sons of Adams have been left of God to fall into, Having been notified
							by order of the Generall court to appear before your Honors to give an
							account as near as I can what dammage my self together with my aforesaid
							former Husband did sustain in our Estate besides the fearfull odium cast
							on him by imputing to him &amp; causing him to suffer death for such
							a piece of wickedness as I have not the least reason in the world to
							thinke he was guilty of I say besides that reproach &amp; the grief
							&amp; sorrow I was exposed to by that means I do account our dammage
							as to our outward estate to have been very considerable. for by reason
							of my said former Husband being seized by order of the civil Authority
							&amp; imprisoned all our Husbands concerns were laid by for that
							summer we had not opportunity to plant or sow whereas we were wont to
							raise our own bread corn I Reckon (which your Honors may please more
							certainly to Inform your selves from the Records of those unhappy times
							&amp; things that happened) I say according to my best Remembranc
							from the time of his first imprisonment to the time of his suffering was
							near upon half a year all which time I was at the trouble &amp;
							charge to provide for him in prison what he stood in need of out of our
							own estate, my aforesaid Husband was 3 weeks a prisoner at Boston which
							occasioned me to be at yet more charge &amp; trouble &amp; altho
							I had after his sentence of death was past upon him obtained a Replevin
							for him for a little time which not coming as was expected at the time
							appointed I was forced to hire a horse at Salem &amp; go to Boston
							to see what was the reason of the failure, I have nothing further to add
							but only to pray your Honors to guess at the dammage as well as you can
							by the Information I have here given &amp; that God will direct you
							in &amp; about what you are now <pb n="1009"/> concerned about,

						<p>Whereas my mother <name type="person" key="warsar">Sarah Wardel</name>
							was condemned by the court at Salem sometime in January in the year

							Court, for the taking of the Attainder of those that were condemned in
							that year my mother being since deceased, I thought it my duty to
							endeavour that her name may have the benefit of that Act. I therefore
							humbly pray your Honours to Represent this case to the Honourable Gen'll
							Court, that my mothers name may be inserted in the said Act. And whereas
							in the account which I gave to your Honors when you met at Salem the
							Last winter, I mentioned only what was seized of my Father's Estate by
							the Sherriffe, but gave no account of other charges which did arise from
							the imprisonment of my Father and mother, they having provided for their
							own subsistance while they were in Prison, and I suppose there was
							something considerable payd to the keeper of the prison, though I am not
							able now to give a particular account how much it was. If your Honours
							please to allow me something opon that account, It will be thankfully
							acknowledged by [you] Your honours most humble servant </p>
