                        had broke in upon severall Townes, some scores of poor people were taken
                        with preternaturall torments some scalded with brimstone some had pins stuck
                        in their flesh others hurried into the fire and water and some dragged out
                        of their houses and carried over the tops of trees and hills for many Miles
                        together; it hath been represented to mee much like that of Sweden about
                        thirty years agoe, and there were many committed to prison upon suspicion of
                        Witchcraft before my arrivall. The loud cries and clamours of the friends of
                        the afflicted people with the advice of the Deputy Governor and many others
                        prevailed with mee to give a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering
                        what witchcraft might be at the bottome or whether it were not a possession.
                        The chief Judge in this Commission was the Deputy Governour and the rest
                        were persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched
                        upon. When the Court came to sitt at Salem in the County of Essex they
                        convicted more than twenty persons of being guilty of witchcraft, some of
                        the convicted were such as confessed their Guilt, the Court as I understand
                        began their proceedings with the accusations of the afflicted and then went
                        upon other humane evidences to strengthen that. I was almost the whole time
                        of the proceeding abroad in the service of Their Majesties in the Eastern
                        part of the County and depended upon the Judgment of the Court as to a right
                        method of proceeding in cases of Witchcraft but when I came home I found
                        many persons in a strange ferment of dissatisfaction which was increased by
                        some hott Spiritts that blew up the flame, but on enquiring into the matter
                        I found that the <pb n="862"/>
                        <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> had taken upon him the name and shape of
                        severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain knowledge of
                        good reputation for which cause I have now forbidden the committing of any
                        more that shall be accused without unavoydable necessity, and those that
                        have been committed I would shelter from any Proceedings against them
                        wherein there may be the least suspition of any wrong to be done unto the
                        Innocent. I would also wait for any particular directions or commands if
                        their Majesties please to give mee any for the fuller ordering this
                        perplexed affair. I have also put a stop to the printing of any discourses
                        one way or other, that may increase the needless disputes of people upon
                        this occasion, because I saw a likelyhood of kindling an inextinguishable
                        flame if I should admitt any publique and open Contests and I have grieved
                        to see that some who should have done their Majesties and this Province
                        better service have so far taken Councill of Passion as to desire the
                        precipitancy of these matters, these things have been improved by some to
                        give me many interuptions in their Majesties service and in truth none of my
                        vexations have been greater than this, than that their majesties service has
                        been hereby unhappily clogged, and the Persons who have made soe ill
                        improvement of these matters here are seeking to turne it all upon mee, but
                        I hereby declare that as soon as I came from fighting against their
                        Majesties Enemyes and understood what danger some of their innocent subjects
                        might be exposed to, if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did
                        prevaile either to the committing or trying any of them, I did before any
                        application was made unto me about it put a stop to the proceedings of the
                        Court and they are now stopt till their Majesties pleasure be known. Sir I
                        beg pardon for giving you all this trouble, the reason is because I know my
                        enemies are seeking to turn it all upon me and I take this liberty because I
                        depend upon your friendship, and desire you will please to give a true
                        understanding of the matter if any thing of this kind be urged or made use
                        of against mee. Because the justnesse of my proceeding herein will bee a
                        sufficient defence. Sir </p>

                    <p>By the Capn. of the Samuell and Henry <!-- Comment: --> I gave an account
                        that att my arrival here I found the Prisons full of people committed upon
                        suspition of witchcraft and that continuall complaints were made to me that
                        many persons were grievously tormented by witches and that they cryed out
                        upon severall persons by name, as the cause of their torments. The number of
                        these complaints increasing every day, by advice of the Lieut Govr. and the
                        Councill I gave a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to try the suspected
                        witches and at that time the generality of the people represented to me as
                        reall witchcraft and gave very strange instances of the same. The first in
                        Commission was the Lieut. Govr. and the rest persons of the best prudence
                        and figure that could then be pitched upon and I depended upon the Court for
                        a right method of proceeding in cases of witchcraft. At that time I went to
                        command the army at the Eastern part of the Province, for the French and
                        Indians had made an attack upon some of our Fronteer Towns. I continued
                        there for some time but when I returned I <pb n="864"/> found people much
                        disatisfied at the proceedings of the Court, for about Twenty persons were
                        condemned and executed of which number some were thought by many persons to
                        be innocent. The Court still proceeded in the same method of trying them,
                        which was by the evidence of the afflicted persons who when they were
                        brought into the Court as soon as the suspected witches looked upon them
                        instantly fell to the ground in strange agonies and grievous torments, but
                        when touched by them upon the arme or some other part of their flesh they
                        immediately revived and came to themselves, upon [which] they made oath that
                        the Prisoner at the Bar did afflict them and that they saw their shape or
                            <orig reg="specter">spectre</orig> come from their bodies which put them
                        to such paines and torments: When I enquired into the matter I was enformed
                        by the Judges that they begun with this, but had humane testimony against
                        such as were condemned and undoubted proof of their being witches, but at
                        length I found that the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> did take upon him
                        the shape of Innocent persons and some were accused of whose innocency I was
                        well assured and many considerable persons of unblameable life and
                        conversation were cried out upon as witches and wizards. The Deputy Govr.
                        notwithstanding persisted vigorously in the same method, to the great
                        disatisfaction and disturbance of the people, untill I put an end to the
                        Court and stopped the proceedings, which I did because I saw many innocent
                        persons might otherwise perish and at that time I thought it my duty to give
                        an account thereof that their Ma'ties pleasure might be signifyed, hoping
                        that for the better ordering thereof the Judges learned in the law in
                        England might give such rules and directions as have been practized in
                        England for proceedings in so difficult and so nice a point; When I put an
                        end to the Court there ware at least fifty persons in prison in great misery
                        by reason of the extream cold and their poverty, most of them having only
                            <orig reg="specter">spectre</orig> evidence against them, and their
                        mittimusses being defective, I caused some of them to be lett out upon bayle
                        and put the Judges upon considering of a way to reliefe others and prevent
                        them from perishing in prison, upon which some of them were convinced and
                        acknowledged that their former proceedings were too violent and not grounded
                        upon a right foundation but that if they might sit againe, they would
                        proceed after another method, and whereas <name type="person" key="matinc"
                            >Mr. Increase Mathew</name> and severall other Divines did give it as
                        their Judgment that the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> might afflict in the
                        shape of an innocent person and that the look and touch of the suspected
                        persons was not sufficient proofe against them, these things had not the
                        same stress layd upon them as before, and upon <pb n="865"/> this
                        consideration I permitted a spetiall Superior Court to be held at Salem in
                        the County of Essex on the third day of January, the Lieut Govr. being Chief
                        Judge. Their method of proceeding being altered, all that were brought to
                        tryall to the number of fifety two, were cleared saving three, and I was
                        enformed by the Kings Attorny Generall that some of the cleared and the
                        condemned were under the same circumstances or that there was the same
                        reason to clear the three condemned as the rest according to his Judgment.
                        The Deputy Govr. signed a Warrant for their speedy execution and also of
                        five others who were condemned at the former Court of Oyer and terminer, but
                        considering how the matter had been managed I sent a reprieve whereby the
                        execucion was stopped untill their Maj. pleasure be signified and declared.
                        The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was inraged and filled with passionate
                        anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a Superior Court then held at
                        Charles Towne, and indeed hath from the beginning hurried on these matters
                        with great precipitancy and by his warrant hath caused the estates, goods
                        and chattles of the executed to be seized and disposed of without my
                        knowledge or consent. The stop put to the first method of proceedings hath
                        dissipated the blak cloud that threatened this Province with destruccion;
                        for whereas this delusion of the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> did spread
                        and its dismall effects touched the lives and estates of many of their
                        Ma'ties Subjects and the reputation of some of the principall persons here,
                        and indeed unhappily clogged and interrupted their Ma'ties affaires which
                        hath been a great vexation to me, I have no new complaints but peoples minds
                        before divided and distracted by differing opinions concerning this matter
                        are now well composed. </p>

                                &amp; Representatives, now Assembled at Boston. The Humble Address
                                of the ministers, and of some of the Inhabitants of Andover. </name>

                    <p>We being deeply sensible of the heavy judgment that the Righteous God hath
                        brought upon this place, thought it our duty (after our earnest prayers to
                        the God of Heaven, to give us help from our trouble) to lay before this
                        Honourable Assembly, our present distressed estate, and to crave a redress
                        of our greivances. It is well known that many persons of this Town, have
                        been accused of witchcraft, by some distempered persons in these parts and
                        upon complaint made have been apprehended and committed to prison. Now
                        though we would not appear as Advocates for any who shall be found guilty
                            <pb n="877"/> of so horrid a crime, but we heartily desire that this
                        place, and the whole land, may be purged from that great wickedness: yet if
                        any of our #[freinds] friends and neighbours have been misrepresented, as
                        tis possible some of them have been; wee would crave leave (if it might be
                        without offence) to speak something in their behalf, haveing no other
                        desighn therein, then that the truth may appear. We can truly give this
                        Testimony of the most of them belonging to this Town, that have been
                        accused, that they never gave the least occasion (as we hear of) to their
                        neerest relations or most intimate acquaintance, to suspect them of
                        witchcraft. Severall of the women that are accused were members of this
                        church in full Communion, and had obtained a good report, for their
                        blameless conversation, and their walking as becometh woemen professing
                        godliness. But whereas it may be alledged, that the most of our people that
                        have been apprehended for witchcraft, have upon Examination confessed it. To
                        which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for those that freely and upon
                        conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend the case of some of them
                        to be otherwise. for from the information we have had and the discourse some
                        of us have had with the prisoners, we have reason to think that the extream
                        urgency that was used with some of them by their friends and others who
                        privately examined them, and the fear they were then under, hath been an
                        inducement to them to own such things, as we cannott since find thay are
                        conscious of; and the truth of what we now declare, we judge will in time
                        more plainly appear. And some of them have exprest to their neighbours that
                        it hath been their great trouble, that they have wronged themselves and the
                        truth in their confessions. </p>
                    <p>We are also very sensible of the disstressed condition of severall poor
                        familyes, on whom this great trouble is fallen; some #[more] of our
                        neighbors are like to be impoverished &amp; ruin'd by the great charge they
                        are at to maintain such of their familyes as are in Prison, and by the fees
                        that are demanded of them, whose case we pray may be considered. </p>
                    <p>Our troubles which hitherto have been great, we foresee are like to continue
                        and increase, if other methods be not taken then as yet have been, for there
                        are more of our neighb'rs of good reputation &amp; approved integrity, who
                        are still accused, and complaints have been made against them, And we know
                        not who can think himself safe, if the Accusations of children and others
                        who are under a Diabolicall influence shall be received against persons of
                        good fame. </p>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>We thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good creditt among
                        our selves, but some Honorable &amp; worthy men of other places, do suffer
                        in their names by the acusations of afflicted people in this Town </p>
                    <p>Thus haveing given your Honors some account of our present troubles, we crave
                        pardon for our boldness in this Address, and humbly pray this Honored Court
                        to take into their serious consideration our low and distressed estate: And

                        think we have sufficient grounds to make such a plea for them, and hope
                        their Innocency will in time appear to the satisfaction of others, however

                        at Ipswich humbly sheweth, that some of us have Lyen in the prison many
                        monthes, and some of us many weekes, who are charged with witchcraft, and
                        not being consciouse to our selves of <pb n="881"/> any guilt of that nature
                        lying upon our consciences; our earnest request is that seing the winter is
                        soe far come on that it can not be exspected that we should be tryed during
                        this winter season, that we may be released out of prison for the present
                        upon Bayle to answer what we are charged with in the Spring. For we are not
                        in this unwilling nor afrayed to abide the tryall before any Judicature
                        apoynted in convenient season of any crime of that nature; we hope you will
                        put on the bowells of compassion soe far as to concider of our suffering
                        condicion in the present state we are in, being like to perish with cold in
                        lying longer in prison in this cold season of the yeare, some of us being

                        and all most distroyed with soe long an Imprisonment: Thus hoping you will

                    <p>R'nd Sr; Whereas there have been divers reports raysed, how, and, by what
                        hands I know not, of the Towne of Andover, and the Inhabitants, I thought it
                        my bounden duty to give an account to others, so farr as I had the
                        understanding of anything amongst us. Therefore doe declare, that I beleeve
                        the reports have been Scandalous, and unjust, neither will bear the light,
                        As for that, of the Sive, and Cisers I never heard of it, till this last
                        Summer, and the Sabboth after I spake publiqly concerning it since which I
                        beleeve it hath not been tryed, <pb n="882"/> As for such things of Charmes,
                        and ways to find their cattle, I never heard, nor doe I know any Neighbour
                        that ever did so, neither have I any grounds to beleeve it. I have lived
                        above Fortie fower yeares in the Towne, and have been frequent among the
                        Inhabitants, and should certainely heard if so it had been. That there was a
                        suspicion of Goodwife Carrier<!-- Comment: --> among some of us before she
                        was apprehended, I know. As for any other persons, I had no suspicion of
                        them, and had Charity been put on, the <orig reg="Devil">Divel</orig> would
                        not have had such an advantage against us, and I beleeve many Innocent
                        persons have been accused, &amp; Imprisoned, the Conceit of <orig
                            reg="Specter">Spectre</orig> Evidence as an infallible mark did too far
                        prevaile with us Hence we so easily parted with our neighbours of honest,
                        &amp; good report, &amp; members in full Co[mbar ]union, hence we so easily
                        parted with our Children, when we knew nothing in their lives, nor any of
                        our neighbours to suspect them and thus things were hurried on, hence such
                        strange breaches in families, -- severall that came before me, that spake
                        with much sobrietie, professing their innocency, though through the Devils
                        subtilty they were too much urged to Confesse, and we thought we did doe
                        well in so doeing, yet they stood their ground professing they knew nothing,
                        never saw the devil, never made a covenant with him, &amp; the like; &amp;
                        some Children that we have cause to feare that dread has overcome them to

                        her self &amp; others. Not long before that she was sent for she spake as to
                        her owne particular, that she was sure she was no witch, and for her
                        Daughter <name type="person" key="joheli2">Elizabeth</name> , she is but
                        simplish at the best, and I feare the comon speech that was frequently
                        spread among us, of their liberty, if they would confesse, and the like
                        expression used by some, have brought many into a snare, the Lord direct

                    <p> Whereas the Anger of God is not yet turned away; but his Hand is still
                        stretched out against his<lb/> people; in manifold judgments; particularly,
                        in drawing out to such a Length, the Troubles of<lb/> Europe, by a
                        perplexing War. And more Especially, respecting our selves in this Province,
                        in<lb/> that God is pleased still to go on in diminishing our substance
                        cutting short our Harvest;<lb/> blasting our most promising Undertakings;
                        more ways than one, Unsettling of us; and by his more<lb/> immediate Hand,
                        snatching away many out of our Embraces by suddain &amp; violent deaths;
                        even at<lb/> this time when the Sword is devouring so many; both at home and
                        abroad; and that after many Days<lb/> of publick and Solemn addressing of
                        Him. And altho, considering the many Sins prevailing in the<lb/> midst of
                        us, We cannot but wonder at the Patience and Mercy moderating these Rebukes;
                        yet we<lb/> cannot but also Fear, that there is somthing still wanting to
                        accompany our Suplications. And<lb/> doubtless there are some particular
                        Sins, which God is angry with our Israel for, that have not<lb/> been duely
                        seen and resented by us, about which God expects to be sought, if ever He

                    <p> Wherefore its Commandd &amp; Apointd that Thursday the Fourteenth of January

                    <p>The Address of severall Ministers of the County of Essex. </p>
                    <p>Whereas in the year 1692 some of our neighbours of a good conversation, were
                        apprehended and imprisoned upon suspition of Witchcraft, upon the complaint
                        of some young persons under Diabolicall molestations; and upon their Tryall
                        at the Court at Salem were condemned; great weight being layd upon the
                        evidence of the Afflicted persons, their Accusers Sentence of Death was
                        Executed on severall of them, others were Reprieved. But since it is
                        apparent and hath been Acknowledged, that there were Errors and mistakes in
                        the aforesaid Tryalls; and notwithstanding the care and conscientious
                        endeavour of the Honorable Judges to do the thing that is right: yet there
                        is great reason to fear that Innocent persons then suffered, and that God
                        may have a controversy with the Land upon that account. </p>
                    <p>We would therefore humbly propose to the consideration of this Honored Court,
                        whether something may not, and ought not, to be publickly done to clear the
                        good name and reputation of some who have suffered as aforesaid, against
                        whom there was not as is supposed sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of
                        such a crime and for whom there are good grounds of charity. Some of the
                        condemned persons aforesaid, and others in behalf of their Relations who

                    <p>We whose names are under-written, inhabitants of Andover; whenas that
                        horrible and tremendous judgment beginning at Salem village in the year
                        1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at <name type="person"
                            key="parsam">Mr. Parris's</name> house, several young persons, being
                        seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for afflicting them, and
                        many there believing it so to be, we being informed that, if a person was
                        sick, the afflicted person could tell what or who was the cause of that
                        sickness: <name type="person" key="baljos">Joseph Ballard</name> , of
                        Andover, his wife being sick at the same time, he, either from himself or by
                        the advice of others, fetched two of the persons, called the afflicted
                        persons, from Salem village to Andover, which was the beginning of that
                        dreadful calamity that befel us in Andover, believing the said accusations
                        to be true, sent for the said persons to come together to the meeting house
                        in Andover, the afflicted persons being there. After <name type="person"
                            key="bartho1">Mr. Barnard</name> had been at prayer, we were
                        blindfolded, and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being
                        in their fits and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence,
                        as they said; and some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they
                        said they were well, and that we were guilty of afflicting them: Whereupon,
                        we were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the Justice of the peace
                        and forthwith carried to Salem. And, by reason of that sudden surprizal, we
                        knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime, we were all exceedingly
                        astonished and amazed, and consternated and affrighted even out of our
                        reason. and our nearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful
                        condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehended there was no other way
                        to save our lives, as the case was then circumstanced, but by our confessing
                        ourselves to be such and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be,
                        they, out of tenderness and pity, persuaded us to confess what we did
                        confess. And indeed that confession, that it is said we made, was no other
                        than what was suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we
                        were witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it
                        was so; and our understandings, our reason, our faculties, almost gone, we
                        were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the hard measures they
                        used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence, but said any thing
                        and every thing which they desired, and most of what we said, was but, in
                        effect, a consenting to what they said. Some time after, when we were better
                        composed, they <pb n="972"/> telling us what we had confessed, we did
                        profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things; and we hearing
                        that <name type="person" key="warsam">Samuel Wardwell</name> had renounced
                        his confession, and quickly after condemned and executed, some of us were
                        told we were going after Wardwell. </p>

                    <p>Isaac Esty Sen of Topsfield in the county of Essex in N. E. having been
                        sorely exercis'd through the holy &amp; awful providence of God depriving
                        him of his beloved wife Mary Esty who suffered death in the year 1692 &amp;
                        under the fearfull odium of one of the worst of crimes that can be laid to
                        the charge of mankind, as if she had been guilty of witchcraft a piece of
                        wickedness which I beleeve she did hate with perfect hatred &amp; by all
                        that ever I could see by her never could see any thing by her that should
                        give me any reason in the lest to think her guilty of any thing of that
                        nature but am firmly persuaded that she was as innocent of it as any to such
                        a shameful death -- Upon consideration of a notification from the Honored

                        circumstances to give some account of what my Estate was damnify'd by reason
                        of such a hellish molestation do hereby declare which may also be seen by
                        comparing papers &amp; records that my wife was near upon 5 months
                        imprisoned all which time I provided maintenance for her at my own cost
                        &amp; charge, went constantly twice aweek to provide for her what she needed
                        3 weeks of this 5 months she was in prison at Boston &amp; I was constrained
                        to be at the charge of transporting her to &amp; fro. So that I can not but
                        think my charge in time and mony might amount to 20 pounds besides my
                        trouble &amp; sorrow of heart in being deprived of her after such a manner
                        which this world can never make me any compensation for. </p>

                        family in the year 1692 by reason of the Imprisonment condemnation and
                        Execution of my Honoured Mother <name type="person" key="nurreb">Rebekah

                        in Salem and Boston for the space of almost four months </p>
                    <p>2. And also we spent much time and made many Journys to Boston &amp; Salem
                        &amp; other places in order to have vindicated her Innocency. </p>
                    <p>3 And altho we produced plentifull testimony that my honoured and Dear mother
                        had led a blameless life from her youth up -- yet she was condemned and
                        executed upon such Evidence as is now Generally thought to be Insufficient,
                        which may be seen in the court record of her tryall. </p>

                        removeing of which reproach is the principal thing wherein we desire
                        restitution. </p>
                    <p>5 And as we know not how to express our loss of such a mother in such a way;
                        so we know not how to compute our charge but shall leave it to the judgm't.
                        of others, and shall not be critical but ready to receive such a
                        satisfaction as shall be by the Honourable Court judged sufficient -- so

                        suffered death in that hour of the power of darkness as if he had been

                        can what dammage my self together with my aforesaid former Husband did

                        him &amp; causing him to suffer death for such a piece of wickedness as I
                        have not the least reason in the world to thinke he was guilty of I say
                        besides that reproach &amp; the grief &amp; sorrow I was exposed to by that
                        means I do account our dammage as to our outward estate to have been very
                        considerable. for by reason of my said former Husband being seized by order
                        of the civil Authority &amp; imprisoned all our Husbands concerns were laid
                        by for that summer we had not opportunity to plant or sow whereas we were

                        &amp; things that happened) I say according to my best Remembranc from the
                        time of his first imprisonment to the time of his suffering was near upon
                        half a year all which time I was at the trouble &amp; charge to provide for
                        him in prison what he stood in need of out of our own estate, my aforesaid
                        Husband was 3 weeks a prisoner at Boston which occasioned me to be at yet
                        more charge &amp; trouble &amp; altho I had after his sentence of death was
                        past upon him obtained a Replevin for him for a little time which not coming
                        as was expected at the time appointed I was forced to hire a horse at Salem
                        &amp; go to Boston to see what was the reason of the failure, I have nothing
                        further to add but only to pray your Honors to guess at the dammage as well

                    <p>Whereas my mother <name type="person" key="warsar">Sarah Wardel</name> was
                        condemned by the court at Salem sometime in January in the year 1692, as I
                        suppose will appear by the Records of the Tryalls at that Court, but her
                        name is not inserted in the late Act of the Generall Court, for the taking
                        of the Attainder of those that were condemned in that year my mother being
                        since deceased, I thought it my duty to endeavour that her name may have the
                        benefit of that Act. I therefore humbly pray your Honours to Represent this
                        case to the Honourable Gen'll Court, that my mothers name may be inserted in
                        the said Act. And whereas in the account which I gave to your Honors when
                        you met at Salem the Last winter, I mentioned only what was seized of my
                        Father's Estate by the Sherriffe, but gave no account of other charges which
                        did arise from the imprisonment of my Father and mother, they having
                        provided for their own subsistance while they were in Prison, and I suppose
                        there was something considerable payd to the keeper of the prison, though I
                        am not able now to give a particular account how much it was. If your
                        Honours please to allow me something opon that account, It will be
                        thankfully acknowledged by [you] Your honours most humble servant </p>
