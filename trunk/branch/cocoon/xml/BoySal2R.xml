							1692 </date> That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told
						concerning <name type="person" key="hoador">Dorcas Hoar</name> her beeing a
						fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should
						live poorely so long as her husband <name type="person" key="hoawil">willm
							Hoar</name> did live, but the said will should dye before her, &amp;
						after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of <name type="person"
							key="corens">Ens: Corning</name> &amp; his wife who should dye.first
						&amp; that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two
						yeares agoe the s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Dorcas</name>
						manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life &amp;
						that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, &amp; their were rules to know
						what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an <orig reg="evil"
							>evill</orig> book &amp; <orig reg="evil">evill</orig> art shee
						seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices: whereupon I had
						great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I
						discovered <pb n="398"/> an evillractice had been between a servant of mine
						&amp; some of s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Hoars</name> children
						in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Hoars</name> . and I had a daughter <name type="person"
							key="halreb">Rebecca</name> then between 11 &amp; 12 years old,
						whome I asked if she knew of the <name type="person" key="hoador"
						>Hoars</name> stealing: she told me yea, But durst not reveale it to me,
						&amp; one reason was, she was threatened that <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> was a witch &amp; had a book by w'ch
						shee could tell what s'd <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> did
						tell me in my house &amp; if the s'd <name type="person" key="halreb"
							>Rebecca</name> told me of the stealing, the said <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Hoar</name> would raise the <orig reg="devil">devill</orig>
						to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that effect. (but whether she said
						that <name type="person" key="hoador">Dorcas</name> her selfe or her
						chilldren told <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> those words I
						remember not) I asked <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> if she
						saw the book she said yea, she was shewed that book &amp; their were
						many streaks &amp; pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said
							<name type="person" key="hoador">Hoar</name> could reveale secretes
						&amp; work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it
						was like a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you
						of the stealing <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> will
						bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of <name
							type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> . But she replyed I know
							<name type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> is a witch (or to the
						effect) &amp; then told storys of strange things that had been acted in
						or about my house, when I &amp; my wife were abroad to fright s'd <name
							type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> into silence about the theft,
						w'ch s'd <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> judged to be acts
						of s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Hoars</name> witchcraft the
						particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the s'd <name
							type="person" key="hoador">Hoar</name> had told me of a book of palmstry
						she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better
						satisfyed I asked <name type="person" key="tuctho">Thomas Tuck</name> if he
						knew <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> to have a book of
						fortune telling &amp; he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he
						had seen w'th streaks &amp; pictures in it and that it was about the
						bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this
						confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after
						my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went
						in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them
						w'ch can kill the boady &amp;c. </p>
					<p>About those times other things were spoken of the s'd <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Hoares</name> suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a
						frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for
						his consideration &amp; as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an
						opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had
						&amp; <name type="person" key="hoawil">W'm Hoar</name> answered the book
						was <name type="person" key="samjoh">John Samsons</name> &amp; his wife
						had returned the <pb n="399"/> book long agoe &amp; so the matter was
						left for that time. When discourses revived of <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Goody Hoars</name> fortune telling of later times,
						&amp; she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may
						things that I had known &amp; heard of her. Shee told me that he owne
						fortune that she spake of, she was told by a shipmaster when she was first
						marryed. &amp; <name type="person" key="corens">Ens: Corning</name>
						fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to
						pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of s'd
							<name type="person" key="corens">Corning</name> or his wife: But as I
						take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the <orig reg="devil"
							>devill</orig>, or any spirit but ones, &amp; that was soon after
						old <name type="person" key="tuctho">Thomas Tuck</name> dyed (w'ch I take to
						be about ten yeare since) &amp; that shee took it to be the Ghost of
							<name type="person" key="tuctho">Thom: tuck</name> coming to speak w'th
						her about some land s'd <name type="person" key="tuctho">Tuck</name> had
						told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost &amp;
						got away.</p>

					<p>The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch
						agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of <name
							type="person" key="samjoh">John Samsons</name> w'ch he had from her as
						she said above 20 years agoe &amp; that shee had not told fortunes since
						the time I had layed before her the <orig reg="evil">evill</orig> of it.
						w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th <name type="person"
							key="samjoh">John Samson</name> &amp; he told me that he had a book
						of Palmstry when he lived at <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody
						Hoars</name> w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. &amp;
						he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since &amp; had not seen it
						since </p>

					<p>After my Humble Duty Remmbered to you, hoping in the Lord of your good

						me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted
						Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized
						for the King. The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the
						Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed
						several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding
						of my own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded
						Conscience who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on
						in my Sins, but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in
						any longer, but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the
						Magistrates, who would not believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in
						here, and God knows how soon I shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me
						beg your Prayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy

					<p>The humble declaration of <name type="person" key="jacmar">Margaret
						Jacobs</name> unto the honoured court now sitting at Salem, sheweth </p>
					<p>That whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely confined here in
						Salem goal for the crime of witchcraft, which crime thanks be to the Lord I
						am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment: May
						it please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the possessed
						persons, as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination,
						which persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much startle and
						affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least measure, how
						or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else they would
						not fall down at me; they told me, if I would not confess, I should be put
						down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should
						have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart,
						to save my life; made me make the like confession I did, which confession,
						may it please the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very
						first night after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience
						that I could not sleep for fear the devil should carry me away for telling
						such horrid lies. I was, may it please the honoured court, sworn to my
						confession, as I understand since, but then, at that time, was ignorant of
						it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I trust,
						out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false forswearing
						myself. What I said, was altogether false against my grandfather, and <name
							type="person" key="bureo">Mr. Burroughs</name> , which I did to save my
						life and to have my liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience,
						made me in so much horror, that I could not contain myself before I had
						denied my confession, which I did though I saw nothing but death before <pb
							n="492"/> me, chusing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live
						in such horror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my
						confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more
						felicity in spirit, a thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement. </p>
					<p>And now, may it please your honours, your declarant, having, in part, given
						your honours a description of my condition, do leave it to your honours
						pious and judicious discretions, to take pity and compassion on my young and
						tender years, to act and do with me, as the Lord above and your honours
						shall see good, having no friend, but the Lord, to plead my cause for me;
						not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft, nor any
						other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant
						shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for your honours happiness in
						this life and eternal felicity in the world to come. So prays your honours
						declarant. </p>

						&amp; earnestly seek unto Your Excellency &amp; to Your Hon'rs for
						releif in this case: </p>
					<p>Your Petitioner who knows well the Condition of her poor Daughter, together
						with severall others of good repute and creditt are ready to offer their
						Oaths, that the s'd Jacobs is a Woman Craz'd, Distracted &amp; Broken in

						upwards; </p>
					<p>However for (I think) about this half Year the s'd Jacobs has lyen in
						Pris&obar; &amp; yet remaines there attended with many sore
						Difficulties: </p>
					<p>Christianity &amp; Nature do each of them oblige Your Petitioner to be
						very Solicitous in this matter, and altho many weighty cases do exercise
						Your thoughts, Yet Your Petitioner can have no rest in her mind, till such
						time as she has offer'd this her addresse on behalf of her daughter: </p>
					<p>Some have dyed already in Prison, and others have been dangerously sick,
						&amp; how soon Others, &amp; among them my Poor Child, by the
						Difficulties of this Confinem't may be sick &amp; dye, <orig reg="God"
							>G'd</orig> only knows: </p>
					<p>She is uncapable of making that shift for her self that others can do,
						&amp; such are her circumstances on other accounts that Your Petitioner
						who is her tender Mother has many great Sorrows &amp; almost
						overco&mbar;ing burthens on her mind upon her account, but in the midst
						of all her &pbar;plexities and troubles (next to supplicating to a Good

					<p>Q. <name type="person" key="fosann">Goody Foster!</name> you remember we have
						three times spoken with you, and do you now remember what you then confessed
						to us? -- You have been engaged in very great wickedness, and some have been
						left to hardness of heart to deny; but it seems that God will give you more
						favour than others, inasmuch as you relent. But your daughter here hath
						confessed some things that you did not tell us of. Your daughter was with
						you and Goody Carrier,<!-- Comment: --> when you did ride upon the stick. A.
						I did not know it. Q. How long have you known your daughter to be engaged?
						A. I cannot tell, nor have I any knowledge of it at all. Q. Did you see your
						daughter at the meeting? A. No. Q. Your daughter said she was at the witches
						meeting, and that you yourself stood at a distance off and did not partake
						at that meeting; and you said so also; give us a relation from the beginning
						until now. A. I know none of their names that were there, but only Goody
						Carrier.<!--
Comment: --> Q. Would you know their faces if you saw them? A.
						I cannot tell. Q. Where there not two companies in the field at the same
						time? A. I remember no more. -- <name type="person" key="warmar">Mary
						Warren</name>, one of the afflicted, said that Goody
						Carrier's<!--
Comment: --> shape told her, that <name type="person"
							key="fosann">Goody Foster</name> had made her daughter a witch. -- Q. Do
						not you acknowledge that you did so about 13 years ago? A. No, and I know no
						more of my daughter's being a witch than what day I shall die upon. Q. Are
						you willing your daughter should make a full and free confession? A. Yes. Q.
						Are you willing to do so too? A. Yes. Q. You cannot expect peace of
						conscience without a free confession. A. If I knew any thing more, I would
						speak it to the utmost. -- Goody Lacey, the daughter, called in, began thus;
						Oh! mother! how do you do? We have left Christ, and the devil hath gat hold
						of us. How shall I get rid of this evil one? I desire God to break my rocky
						heart that I may get the victory this time. Q. <name type="person"
							key="fosann">Goody Foster!</name> you cannot get rid of this snare, your
						heart and mouth is not open. A. I did not see the devil, I was praying to
						the Lord. Q. What Lord? A. To God. Q. What God do witches pray to? A. I
						cannot tell, the Lord help me. Q. Goody Lacey!<!-- Comment: --> had you no
						discourse with your mother when riding? A. No, I think I had not a word. Q.
						Who rid foremost on that stick to the village? A. I suppose <pb n="532"/> my
						mother. -- <name type="person" key="fosann">Goody Foster</name> said, that
						Goody Carrier was foremost -- Q. Goody Lacey! <!-- Comment:
--> how many
						years ago since they were baptized? A. Three or four years ago, I suppose.
						Q. Who baptized them? A. The old serpent. Q. How did he do it? A. He dipped
						their heads in the water, saying, they were his and that he had power over
						them. Q. Where was this? A. At Fall's river. Q. How many were baptized that
						day? A. Some of the chief; I think they were six baptized. Q. Name them. A.
						I think they were of the higher powers. -- <name type="person" key="lacmar2"
							>Mary Lacey</name> , the grand-daughter, was brought in, and <name
							type="person" key="warmar">Mary Warren</name> fell into a violent fit.
						Q. How dare you come in here, and bring the devil with you to afflict these
						poor creatures? -- Lacey laid her hand on <name type="person" key="warmar"
							>Warren's</name> arm, and she recovered from her fit. -- Q. You are here
						accused of practising witchcraft upon <name type="person" key="baleli1"
							>Goody Ballard;</name> which way do you do it? A. I cannot tell. Where
						is my mother that made me a witch, and I knew it not? Q. Can you look upon
						that maid <name type="person" key="warmar">Mary Warren</name>, and not hurt
						her? Look upon her in a friendly way. -- She, trying so to do, struck her
						down with her eyes. Q. Do you acknowledge now you are a witch? A. Yes. Q.
						How long have you been a witch? A. Not above a week. Q. Did the devil appear
						to you? A. Yes. Q. In what shape? A. In the shape of a horse. Q. What did he
						say to you? A. He bid me not to be afraid of any thing, and he would not
						bring me out, but he has proved a liar from the beginning. Q. When was this?
						A. I know not; above a week. Q. Did you set your hand to the book? A. No. Q.
						Did he bid you worship him? A. Yes, he bid me also afflict persons. -- You
						are now in the way to obtain mercy if you will confess and repent. She said,
						the Lord help me. Q. Do not you desire to be saved by Christ? A. Yes. --
						Then you must confess freely what you know in this matter. She then
						proceeded. -- I was in bed and the devil came to me and bid me obey him and
						I should want for nothing, and he would not bring me out. Q. But how long
						ago? A. A Little more than a year. Q. Was that the first time? A. Yes. Q.
						How long was you gone from your father, when you ran away? A. Two days. Q.
						Where had you your food? A. At <name type="person" key="stojoh">John

						then going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the

							>(8. Sept. 92.) </date> of <name type="person" key="osgmar">Mary
						Osgood</name> , wife of <name type="person" key="osgjoh">Captain
						Osgood</name> of Andover, taken before <name type="person" key="hawjoh">John
							Hawthorne </name> and other their Majesties justices. </p>
					<p>She confesses, that about 11 years ago, when she was in a melancholy state
						and condition, she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain
						time, she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of the house, which yet
						she thought was a real cat. However, at that time, it diverted her from
						praying to God, and instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which
						time she made a covenant with the devil, who, as a black man, came to her
						and presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger and that left a red
						spot: And that upon her signing, the devil told her he was her God, and that
						she should serve and worship him, and, she believes, she consented to it.
						She says further, that about two years agone, she was carried through the
						air, in company with <name type="person" key="fryeun">deacon Frye's
						wife</name> , <name type="person" key="bakebe">Ebenezer Baker's wife</name>
						, and <name type="person" key="sprmar">Goody Tyler</name> , to five mile
						pond, where she was baptized by the devil, who dipped her face in the water
						and made her renounce her former baptism, and told her she must be his, soul
						and body, forever, and that she must serve him, which she promised to do.
						She says, the renouncing her first baptism was after her dipping, and that
						she was transported back again through the air, in company with the
						forenamed persons, in the same manner as she went, and believes they were
						carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the pole? A. As I said
						before, viz. four persons and no more but whom she had named above. -- She
						confesses she has afflicted three persons, <name type="person" key="sawjoh"
							>John Sawdy</name> , <name type="person" key="sprmar">Martha
						Sprague</name> and <name type="person" key="fosros">Rose Foster</name> , and
						that she did it by pinching her bed clothes, and giving consent the devil
						should do it in her shape, and that the devil could not do it without her
						consent. -- She confesses the afflicting persons in the court, by the glance
						of her eye. She says, as she was coming down to Salem to be <pb n="616"/>
						examined, she and the rest of the company with her, stopped at Mr.
						Phillips's <!-- Comment: --> to refresh themselves, and the afflicted
						persons, being behind them upon the road, came up just as she was mounting
						again and were then afflicted, and cried out upon her, so that she was
						forced to stay until they were all past, and said she only looked that way
						towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape of an innocent
						person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this way of
						witchcraft? A. Satan, and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction and
						quietness in her future state, but never performed any thing; and that she
						has lived more miserably and more discontented since, than ever before. She
						confesses further, that she herself, in company with <name type="person"
							key="pareli">Goody Parker</name> , <name type="person" key="sprmar"
							>Goody Tyler</name> , and Goody Dean <!-- Comment: --> , had a meeting
						at <name type="person" key="tylmos">Moses Tyler's</name> house, last monday
						night, to afflict, and that she and Goody Dean <!-- Comment: --> carried the
						shape of Mr. Dean, <!-- Comment: --> the minister, between them, to make
						persons believe that Mr. Dean <!-- Comment: --> afflicted. Q. What hindered
						you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not suffer it so
						to be, that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. Have
						you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof, as I shall
						answer in the presence of God and his people; but said, that the black man
						stood before her, and told her, that what she had confessed was a lie;
						notwithstanding, she said that what she had confessed was true, and thereto
						put her hand. Her husband being present was asked, if he judged his wife to
						be any way discomposed. He answered, that having lived with her so long, he
						doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed, but has cause to believe what
						she has said is true. -- When <name type="person" key="osgmar">Mistress
							Osgood</name> was first called, she afflicted <name type="person"
							key="sprmar">Martha Sprague</name> and <name type="person" key="fosros"
							>Rose Foster</name> , by the glance of her eyes, and recovered them out

						so thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and
						accordingly did prefix the said time. Being asked about the cat, in the
						shape of which she had confessed that the Devil had appeared to her,
						&amp;c., she replied, that, being told that the Devil had appeared to
						her, and must needs appear to her, &amp;c. (she being a witch), she at
						length did own that the Devil had appeared to her; and, being pressed to say
						in what creature's shape he appeared, she at length did say that it was in
						the shape of a cat. Remembering that, some time before her being
						apprehended, as she went out at her door, she saw a cat, &amp;c.; not as

						it, but because some creature she must mention, and this came into her mind

					</opener>
					<p>We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long
						under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that
						great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it
						our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them
						will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to
						speak something at present are <name type="person" key="osgmar">Mrs. Mary
							Osgood</name> , <name type="person" key="fryeun">Eunice Frye</name> ,
							<name type="person" key="dandel">Deliverance Dane</name> , <name
							type="person" key="wilsar">Sarah Wilson</name> and <name type="person"
							key="barabi">Abigail Barker</name> , who are women of whom we can truly
						give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us
						so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to
						suspect them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary
						conversation have obtained a good report in the place, where they have been
						well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members. </p>
					<p>We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were
						accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent
						were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were
						accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and
						others, tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have
						thought any evil of them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of
						that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people, took
						great pains to persuade them to own what they were, by the afflicted,
						charged with, and, indeed, did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves
						guilty, as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good
						women did very much assert their innocency, yet some of them said they were
						not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them, because there was
						that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain
						indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they seriously professed they
						knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, by the unwearied
						sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both <pb n="619"/> at
						home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they
						were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and
						believe they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event
						might be, and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that
						confessing was the only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a
						temptation for timorous women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction
						that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves
						proceeded from conviction of the fact, we should have had nothing to have
						said for them, but we are induced to think that it did not, because they did
						soon privately retract what they had said, as we are informed, and, while
						they were in prison, they declared to such as they had confidence to speak
						freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what they had owned, and
						that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden
						they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful
						for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, considering
						the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us, and
						what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, we
						cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that
						hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under
						the like circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of
						them that while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such
						persons as, of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do
						we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of
						that evil that they are now charged with. </p>

					<p>the humble Petition of <name type="person" key="parjoh">John Parker,</name>
						&amp; <name type="person" key="parjos">Joseph Parker </name> of Andover
						sheweth, </p>
					<p>That whereas our mother <name type="person" key="parmar">mary Parker</name>
						of Andover, was apprehended upon suspition of witchcraft, and being brought
						to a tryall at Salem Court, was condemned: since her death the sherriff of
						Essex sent an officer to seise on her estate. The said officer required us
						in their majestyes name to give him an Account of our mothers estate,
						pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told him that our mother left no
						estate; (which we are able to make appear) notwithstanding which, he seised
						upon our cattell, Corn &amp; hay, to a considerable value; and ordered
						us to go down to Salem and make an agreement with the sherrife, otherwise
						the estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing what advantage the Law
						might give him against us, and fearing we should sustain greater Damage by
						the loss of our Estate, went to the sherriff accordingly, who told us he
						might take away all that was seised. if he pleased, but was willing to do us
						a kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded
						ten pounds of us, but at length was willing to take Six pounds, which he has
							<pb n="637"/> obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our
						Mother had left any Estate, we know not of any Law in force in this
						Province, by which it should be forfeited upon her condemnation; much less
						can we understand that there is any Justice or reason, for the sherriff to
						seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our own act has obliged us to pay
						him a Summ of money, yet we declare that we were drawn to it partly by the
						officers great pretences of Law for what he did, partly to prevent the loss
						of our estate which we feard would be immediately sold. </p>
					<p>How we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case, and if it be
						judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us, upon the
						forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that
						obligation, which the sherriff, taking advantage of our ignorance hath
						brough us under And yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray

						What was you to do with it? A. To touch it, and be well. -- Then she fell

							type="person" key="cormar">Goody Corey</name> , and a great many I do

							key="wilabi">Abigail Williams!</name> did you see a company at <name

						Yes Sir, that was their sacrament. Q. How many were there? A. About forty,

						fine grave man, and when he came, he made all the witches to tremble. --
							<name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail Williams</name> confirmed the

						Then <name type="person" key="closar">Sarah Cloyse</name> asked for water,
						and sat down as one seized with a dying fainting fit; and several of the
						afflicted fell into fits, and some of them cried out, Oh! her spirit is gone
						to prison to her sister <name type="person" key="nurreb">Nurse</name> . --
						Q. <name type="person" key="proeli">Elizabeth Procter</name> ! you
						understand whereof you are charged, viz. to be guilty of sundry acts of
						witchcraft; what say you to it? Speak the truth, and so you that are
						afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you will answer it before God
						another day. <name type="person" key="walmar">Mary Walcot!</name> doth this

						This is the woman that came in her shift and choaked me. Q. did she ever
						bring the book? A. Yes, Sir. Q. What to do? A. to write. Q. What, this
						woman? A. Yes, Sir. Q. Are you sure of it? A. Yes, Sir. -- Again, <name
							type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail Williams</name> and <name
							type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name> were spoke to by the
						court, but neither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or
						other fits. Q. What do you say <name type="person" key="proeli">Goody
							Procter</name> to these things? A. I take God in heaven to be my
						witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child unborn. Q. <name
							type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman!</name> doth this woman hurt you.
						A. Yes Sir, a great many times. -- Then the accused looked upon them and
						they fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A.
						Yes, Sir, often, and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it. Q.
							<name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail Williams!</name> does this
						woman hurt you? A. Yes, Sir, often. Q. Does she bring the book to you? A.
						Yes. Q. What would she have you do with it? A. To write in it and I shall be
						well. -- Did not you, said Abigal, tell me, that your maid had written?
							<name type="person" key="proeli">(Procter)</name> Dear Child, it is not
						so. There is another judgement, dear child. -- Then <name type="person"

						>Ann</name> had fits. -- By and by they cried out, look you there is <name
							type="person" key="prosar">Goody Procter</name> upon the beam. -- By and
						by, both of them cried out of <name type="person" key="projoh">Goodman
							Procter</name> himself, and said he was a wizard. -- Immediately, many,
						if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. -- Q. Ann Putman! who hurt
						you? A. <name type="person" key="projoh">Goodman Procter</name> and his wife
						too. -- Afterwards some of the afflicted cried, there is <name type="person"
							key="projoh">Procter</name> going to take up <name type="person"
							key="popmis">Mrs. Pope's</name> feet. -- And her feet were immediately
						taken up. -- Q. What do you say <name type="person" key="projoh">Goodman

							>Goodman Procter</name> going to hurt <name type="person" key="bibsar"
							>Goody Bibber</name>; and immediately<name type="person" key="bibsar"

							<name type="person" key="gouben">Benjamin Gould</name> gave in his

					<p>The foresd <name type="person" key="projoh">John Procter</name> may have
						Great Reason to Justifie the Divine Sovereigntie of God under thos Severe

						Pittie &amp; Indulgenc of Gods Providenc, that we are not Exposed to the
						utmost shame, that the <orig reg="Devil">Divell</orig> can Invent und'r the
						p'rmissions of Sovereigntie, tho not for that Sin fore Named; yet for o'r

						therby abuse Inocents, &amp; such as Do in the fear of God Defie the

						Charitie, That Teacheth us to do, as we would be done by; to offer thus much
						for the Clearing of o'r Neighb'rs Inocencie; viz: That we never had the
						Least Knowledge of such a Nefarious wickedness in o'r said Neighbours, since
						they have been w'thin our acquaintance; Neither doe we remember -- any such

					<p>The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and
						Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, having
						Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged
						against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable
						Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be
						possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will
						be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates,
						Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and
						incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no
						other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent
						Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be
						Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament,
						since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of
						the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till
						they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their
						Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of
						making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a
							<pb n="690"/> Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their
						Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son
							<name type="person" key="prowil">William Procter</name> , when he was
						examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was
						Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his
						Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the
						rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions
						are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our
						Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods.
						If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg
						that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in
						their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if
						not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of
						saving the sheeding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord
						in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants, </p>
