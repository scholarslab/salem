John Hale v. Dorcas Hoar ) 
						John Hale aged 56 yeares Testifieth
							6. 7.
							1692  That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told
						concerning Dorcas Hoar her beeing a
						fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should
						live poorely so long as her husband willm
							Hoar did live, but the said will should dye before her, &amp;
						after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of Ens: Corning &amp; his wife who should dye.first
						&amp; that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two
						yeares agoe the s'd Dorcas
						manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life &amp;
						that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, &amp; their were rules to know
						what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book &amp; evill art shee
						seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices: whereupon I had
						great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I
						discovered  an evillractice had been between a servant of mine
						&amp; some of s'd Hoars children
						in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd Hoars . and I had a daughter Rebecca then between 11 &amp; 12 years old,
						whome I asked if she knew of the Hoars stealing: she told me yea, But durst not reveale it to me,
						&amp; one reason was, she was threatened that Goody Hoar was a witch &amp; had a book by w'ch
						shee could tell what s'd Rebecca did
						tell me in my house &amp; if the s'd Rebecca told me of the stealing, the said Hoar would raise the devill
						to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that effect. (but whether she said
						that Dorcas her selfe or her
						chilldren told Rebecca those words I
						remember not) I asked Rebecca if she
						saw the book she said yea, she was shewed that book &amp; their were
						many streaks &amp; pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said
							Hoar could reveale secretes
						&amp; work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it
						was like a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you
						of the stealing Goody Hoar will
						bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of Goody Hoar . But she replyed I know
							Goody Hoar is a witch (or to the
						effect) &amp; then told storys of strange things that had been acted in
						or about my house, when I &amp; my wife were abroad to fright s'd Rebecca into silence about the theft,
						w'ch s'd Rebecca judged to be acts
						of s'd Hoars witchcraft the
						particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the s'd Hoar had told me of a book of palmstry
						she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better
						satisfyed I asked Thomas Tuck if he
						knew Goody Hoar to have a book of
						fortune telling &amp; he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he
						had seen w'th streaks &amp; pictures in it and that it was about the
						bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this
						confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after
						my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went
						in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them
						w'ch can kill the boady &amp;c. About those times other things were spoken of the s'd Hoares suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a
						frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for
						his consideration &amp; as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an
						opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had
						&amp; W'm Hoar answered the book
						was John Samsons &amp; his wife
						had returned the  book long agoe &amp; so the matter was
						left for that time. When discourses revived of Goody Hoars fortune telling of later times,
						&amp; she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may
						things that I had known &amp; heard of her. Shee told me that he owne
						fortune that she spake of, she was told by a shipmaster when she was first
						marryed. &amp; Ens: Corning
						fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to
						pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of s'd
							Corning or his wife: But as I
						take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the devill, or any spirit but ones, &amp; that was soon after
						old Thomas Tuck dyed (w'ch I take to
						be about ten yeare since) &amp; that shee took it to be the Ghost of
							Thom: tuck coming to speak w'th
						her about some land s'd Tuck had
						told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost &amp;
						got away.The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch
						agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of John Samsons w'ch he had from her as
						she said above 20 years agoe &amp; that shee had not told fortunes since
						the time I had layed before her the evill of it.
						w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th John Samson &amp; he told me that he had a book
						of Palmstry when he lived at Goody
						Hoars w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. &amp;
						he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since &amp; had not seen it
						since

								August 20, 92
							 . 
						Honoured Father, 
					After my Humble Duty Remmbered to you, hoping in the Lord of your good
						Health, as Blessed be God I enjoy, tho in abundance of Affliction, being
						close Confined here in a loathsome Dungeon, the Lord look down in mercy upon
						me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted
						Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized
						for the King. The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the
						Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed
						several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding
						of my own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded
						Conscience who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on
						in my Sins, but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in
						any longer, but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the
						Magistrates, who would not believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in
						here, and God knows how soon I shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me
						beg your Prayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy
						meeting in Heaven. My Mother poor Woman is very Crazey, and 
						remembers her kind Love to you, and to Uncle, viz. 
						D. A. So leaving you to the protection of the Lord, I rest your Dutiful
						Daughter,

						Jacobs unto the honoured court now sitting at Salem, sheweth That whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely confined here in
						Salem goal for the crime of witchcraft, which crime thanks be to the Lord I
						am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment: May
						it please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the possessed
						persons, as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination,
						which persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much startle and
						affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least measure, how
						or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else they would
						not fall down at me; they told me, if I would not confess, I should be put
						down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should
						have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart,
						to save my life; made me make the like confession I did, which confession,
						may it please the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very
						first night after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience
						that I could not sleep for fear the devil should carry me away for telling
						such horrid lies. I was, may it please the honoured court, sworn to my
						confession, as I understand since, but then, at that time, was ignorant of
						it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I trust,
						out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false forswearing
						myself. What I said, was altogether false against my grandfather, and Mr. Burroughs , which I did to save my
						life and to have my liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience,
						made me in so much horror, that I could not contain myself before I had
						denied my confession, which I did though I saw nothing but death before  me, chusing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live
						in such horror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my
						confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more
						felicity in spirit, a thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement. And now, may it please your honours, your declarant, having, in part, given
						your honours a description of my condition, do leave it to your honours
						pious and judicious discretions, to take pity and compassion on my young and
						tender years, to act and do with me, as the Lord above and your honours
						shall see good, having no friend, but the Lord, to plead my cause for me;
						not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft, nor any
						other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant
						shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for your honours happiness in
						this life and eternal felicity in the world to come. So prays your honours
						declarant.

						Distracted &amp; Broken in mind, Your Humble Petitioner does most humbly

						Oaths, that the s'd Jacobs is a Woman Craz'd, Distracted &amp; Broken in
						her mind, &amp; that She has been so these twelve Years &amp;
						upwards; However for (I think) about this half Year the s'd Jacobs has lyen in

						Juryman) 
						
							July  4, 1692.  I Thomas Fisk , the Subscriber hereof, being one of
						them that were of the Jury the last week at Salem-Court, upon the Tryal of
							Rebecka Nurse,  etc., being
						desired by some of the Relations to give a Reason why the Jury brought her
						in Guilty, after her Verdict not Guilty; I do hereby give my Reasons to be
						as follows, viz. 
					When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object
						against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which
						the Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply
						to Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter , who had been faulty in
						setting their hands to the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the
						words were “What, do these persons give in Evidence against me
						now, they used to come among us.” After the honoured Court had
						manifested their dissatisfaction of the  Verdict, several of
						the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon the
						honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the Case, I could
						not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a
						further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and
						then going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the
						Court were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar,
						but made no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to
						me a principal Evidence against her.

							Barker ) 
						
							To the honoured court of Assize held at Salem,
								The humble address of several of the inhabitants 
							of Andover. 
						
						May it please this honoured court, 
					We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long
						under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that
						great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it
						our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them
						will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to
						speak something at present are Mrs. Mary
							Osgood , Eunice Frye ,
							Deliverance Dane , Sarah Wilson and Abigail Barker , who are women of whom we can truly
						give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us
						so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to
						suspect them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary
						conversation have obtained a good report in the place, where they have been
						well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members. We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were
						accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent
						were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were
						accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and
						others, tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have
						thought any evil of them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of
						that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people, took
						great pains to persuade them to own what they were, by the afflicted,
						charged with, and, indeed, did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves
						guilty, as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good
						women did very much assert their innocency, yet some of them said they were
						not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them, because there was
						that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain
						indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they seriously professed they
						knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, by the unwearied
						sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both  at
						home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they
						were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and
						believe they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event
						might be, and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that
						confessing was the only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a
						temptation for timorous women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction
						that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves
						proceeded from conviction of the fact, we should have had nothing to have
						said for them, but we are induced to think that it did not, because they did
						soon privately retract what they had said, as we are informed, and, while
						they were in prison, they declared to such as they had confidence to speak
						freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what they had owned, and
						that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden
						they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful
						for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, considering
						the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us, and
						what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, we
						cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that
						hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under
						the like circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of
						them that while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such
						persons as, of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do
						we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of
						that evil that they are now charged with.

							To his Excellency the Governor, and Councill and
								Representatives; now sitting 
							in Boston 
						
					the humble Petition of John Parker,
						&amp; Joseph Parker  of Andover
						sheweth, That whereas our mother mary Parker
						of Andover, was apprehended upon suspition of witchcraft, and being brought
						to a tryall at Salem Court, was condemned: since her death the sherriff of
						Essex sent an officer to seise on her estate. The said officer required us
						in their majestyes name to give him an Account of our mothers estate,
						pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told him that our mother left no
						estate; (which we are able to make appear) notwithstanding which, he seised
						upon our cattell, Corn &amp; hay, to a considerable value; and ordered
						us to go down to Salem and make an agreement with the sherrife, otherwise
						the estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing what advantage the Law
						might give him against us, and fearing we should sustain greater Damage by
						the loss of our Estate, went to the sherriff accordingly, who told us he
						might take away all that was seised. if he pleased, but was willing to do us
						a kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded
						ten pounds of us, but at length was willing to take Six pounds, which he has
							 obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our
						Mother had left any Estate, we know not of any Law in force in this
						Province, by which it should be forfeited upon her condemnation; much less
						can we understand that there is any Justice or reason, for the sherriff to
						seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our own act has obliged us to pay
						him a Summ of money, yet we declare that we were drawn to it partly by the
						officers great pretences of Law for what he did, partly to prevent the loss
						of our estate which we feard would be immediately sold. How we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case, and if it be
						judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us, upon the
						forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that
						obligation, which the sherriff, taking advantage of our ignorance hath
						brough us under And yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray

						 complained of Goodm Proctor 
						&amp; cryed out w't are you come to, #[are you come to,] you can pinch
						as well as your wife &amp; more to that purpose 6. At night she complained of Goodm:
						Proctor again &amp; beat upon her breast &amp; cryed he
						pinched her. The like I hear at Tho.
							Putmans  house. 12 Day, When the Marshall was sent up to enquire of John Proctor &amp; others &amp; I was
						writing some what thereof as above I met with nothing but interruptions by
						reason of fits upon John Indian
						&amp; Abigail , &amp; Mary Walcot happening to come in just
						before, they one &amp; another cryed out there is Goodm: Proctor very often: And Abigail said there is Goodm: Proctor in the Majstrats lap, at the same
						time Mary Walcot was sitting by a
						knitting we asked her if she saw Goodm:
							Proctor (for Abigail was
						immediately seized with a fit) but she was deaf &amp; dumb, yet still a
						knitting, then Mary recovered her
						self &amp; confirmed what Abigail had said that goodm:
							proctor she saw in the Majstrats lap Then John cryed out to the Dog under the Table to come
						away for Goodm: Proctor was upon his
						back, then he cryed out of Goody
						Cloyse , O you old Witch, &amp; fell immediately into a violent
						fit that 3.men &amp; the Marshall could not without exceeding difficulty
						hold him: In which fit Mary Walcot
						that was knitting &amp; well composed said there was Goodm: Proctor &amp; his wife &amp; Goody Cloyse helping of him. But so
						great were the interruptions of John
						&amp; Abigail by fits while we
						were observing these things to notify them, that we were fain to send them
						both away that I might have liberty to write this  without
						disturbance Mary Walcot abiding
						composed &amp; knitting whilest I was writing &amp; the two other
						sent away, yet by &amp; by whilst I was writing Mary Walcot said there
							Goody Cloyse has pincht me now 
						Note. 
						Mary Walcot never saw Proctor nor his wife till last night
						coming from the examination at Salem &amp; then she saw Goody Proctor behind her brother
						 Jonathan all the way from the Widow Gidneys to Phillips where Jonathan made a
						little stay But this day &amp; time I have been writing this she saw
						them many times. 
						Note.  Just now as soon as I had made an end of
						reading this to the Marshall Mary W
						[torn] immediately cryed O yonder is Good:
							Proctor &amp; his wife &amp; Goody Nurse &amp; Goody Korey &amp; G [torn] Cloyse &amp; Goods Child &amp; then
						said O Goodm: Proctor is going to

									Mr. Mather,

										Bailey
								. 
						
						
							Reverend Gentlemen . 
					The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and
						Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, having
						Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged
						against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable
						Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be
						possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will
						be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates,
						Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and
						incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no
						other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent
						Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be
						Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament,
						since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of
						the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till
						they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their
						Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of
						making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a
							 Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their
						Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son
							William Procter , when he was
						examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was
						Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his
						Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the
						rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions
						are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our
						Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods.
						If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg
						that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in
						their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if
						not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of
						saving the sheeding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord
						in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants, 
						
							JOHN PROCTER , etc.
