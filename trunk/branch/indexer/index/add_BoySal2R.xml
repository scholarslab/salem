						2. May. 1692 . 
					Severall of the afflicted fell into fits as soon as she was brought in El iz: Hubbar
						d: said this woman hath afflicted me ever since last Sab: was
						seven night, &amp; hurt me ever since, &amp; she choakt her own
						husband. 
						Mar y Wal
						cot said she told me the same 
						Abi g: Willi
						ams saith this is the woman that she saw first before Tituba Indian or any else. 
						An n Put
						man said this is the woman that hurts her &amp; the first
						time she was hurt by her was the Sab: was seven night. Susa n: Shel
						don accused her of hurting her last moonday night. 
						Abi g: Willi
						ams &amp; An n Putm an said she told them that she
						had choakt a woman lately at Boston Eliz: Hubbard cryed why do you pinch
						me the mark was visible to the standers by. The Marshall said she pincht her
						fingers at that time. 
						Dorcas Hoar why do you hurt these? I never hurt any child in my life. It is you, or your appearance How can I help it? What is it from you that hurts these? I never saw worse than my self You need not see worse. They charge you with killing your huband I never did, nor never saw you before You sent for Goody Gale to cut your
						head off What do you say to that?  I never sent for her upon that account. What do you say about killing your husband. Susan: Sheldon also charged her that
						she came in with two cats, &amp; brought me the book, &amp; fell
						into a fit &amp; told me your name was Goody Bukly . No, I never did, I never saw thee before. What black cats were those you had? I had none. 
						Mary Walcot , Susan: Sheldon, &amp; Abigail Williams said they saw a black man
						whispering in her ears. Oh! you are liars, &amp; God will stop the mouth of liars You are not to speak after this manner in the Court I will speak the Truth as long as I live. 
						Mary Walcot &amp; Susan: Sheldon &amp; Eliz: Hubbard said again there was a
						man whispering in her ear, &amp; said she should never confess. 
						Good y Bibb
						er free from fits hitherto said there was a black man with her
						&amp; fell into a fit. What do you say to those cats that suckt your breast, what are they? I had no cats. You do not call them cats, what are they that suck you? I never suckt none, but my child. What do you say, you never saw Goody
						Bukly ? I never knew her. 
						Goodm: Bukly testifyed that she had
						been at the house often. I know you but not the woman You said you did not know the Name. Many by-standers testifyed she disowned that she knew the name I did not know the name so as to goe to the woman Susan: Sheldon &amp; Abig:
						Williams cryed there was a blew bird bird gone into her back. The Marshall struck, &amp; several of the by-standers testifyed that they
						saw a fly like a Millar. What did you see goddy Bibber. who
						was looking up Goody Bibber was
						taken dumb. What can you have no heart to confess. I have nothing to do with witchcraft They say the Devil is whispering in your ear.  I cannot help it if they do se it. cannot you confess what you think of these things? Why should I confess that I do not know. Susan: Sheldon cryed O Goody Hoar do
						not kill me, &amp; fell into a fit, &amp; when she came to her self
						she said, she saw a black man whispering in her ear, &amp; she brought
						me the book. I have no book, but the Lords book. What Lords book. The Lords book Oh said some of the afflicted there is one whispering in her ears. There is
						some body will rub your ears shortly, said the examinant Immediately they
						were afflicted, and among others Mercy
							Lewes. Why do you threaten they should be Rubb'd? I did not speak a word of Rubbing. Many testifyed she did. My meaning was God would bring things to light. Your meaning for God to bring the thing to light would be to deliver these
						poor afflicted ones, that would not Rubb them. This is unusual impudence to threaten before Authority. who hurts them now. I know not. They were rubbed after you had threatened them. 
						Mary Walcot , Abigail Williams &amp; Eliz: Hubbard were carried towards her, but they
						could not come near her What is the reason these cannot come near you I can not help it, I do them no wrong, they may come if they will Why you
						see, they cannot come near you I do them no wrong Note. The afflicted were much distressed during her examination. This is true
						account of the Examination of Dorcas
						Hoar without wrong to any party according to my original from
						characters at the moments thereof Witness my hand

John Hale v. Dorcas Hoar ) 
						John Hale aged 56 yeares Testifieth
							6. 7.
							1692  That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told
						concerning Dorcas Hoar her beeing a
						fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should
						live poorely so long as her husband willm
							Hoar did live, but the said will should dye before her, &amp;
						after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of Ens: Corning &amp; his wife who should dye.first
						&amp; that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two
						yeares agoe the s'd Dorcas
						manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life &amp;
						that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, &amp; their were rules to know
						what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book &amp; evill art shee
						seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices: whereupon I had
						great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I
						discovered  an evillractice had been between a servant of mine
						&amp; some of s'd Hoars children
						in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd Hoars . and I had a daughter Rebecca then between 11 &amp; 12 years old,
						whome I asked if she knew of the Hoars stealing: she told me yea, But durst not reveale it to me,
						&amp; one reason was, she was threatened that Goody Hoar was a witch &amp; had a book by w'ch
						shee could tell what s'd Rebecca did
						tell me in my house &amp; if the s'd Rebecca told me of the stealing, the said Hoar would raise the devill
						to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that effect. (but whether she said
						that Dorcas her selfe or her
						chilldren told Rebecca those words I
						remember not) I asked Rebecca if she
						saw the book she said yea, she was shewed that book &amp; their were
						many streaks &amp; pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said
							Hoar could reveale secretes
						&amp; work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it
						was like a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you
						of the stealing Goody Hoar will
						bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of Goody Hoar . But she replyed I know
							Goody Hoar is a witch (or to the
						effect) &amp; then told storys of strange things that had been acted in
						or about my house, when I &amp; my wife were abroad to fright s'd Rebecca into silence about the theft,
						w'ch s'd Rebecca judged to be acts
						of s'd Hoars witchcraft the
						particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the s'd Hoar had told me of a book of palmstry
						she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better
						satisfyed I asked Thomas Tuck if he
						knew Goody Hoar to have a book of
						fortune telling &amp; he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he
						had seen w'th streaks &amp; pictures in it and that it was about the
						bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this
						confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after
						my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went
						in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them
						w'ch can kill the boady &amp;c. About those times other things were spoken of the s'd Hoares suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a
						frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for
						his consideration &amp; as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an
						opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had
						&amp; W'm Hoar answered the book
						was John Samsons &amp; his wife
						had returned the  book long agoe &amp; so the matter was
						left for that time. When discourses revived of Goody Hoars fortune telling of later times,
						&amp; she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may
						things that I had known &amp; heard of her. Shee told me that he owne
						fortune that she spake of, she was told by a shipmaster when she was first
						marryed. &amp; Ens: Corning
						fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to
						pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of s'd
							Corning or his wife: But as I
						take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the devill, or any spirit but ones, &amp; that was soon after
						old Thomas Tuck dyed (w'ch I take to
						be about ten yeare since) &amp; that shee took it to be the Ghost of
							Thom: tuck coming to speak w'th
						her about some land s'd Tuck had
						told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost &amp;
						got away.The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch
						agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of John Samsons w'ch he had from her as
						she said above 20 years agoe &amp; that shee had not told fortunes since
						the time I had layed before her the evill of it.
						w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th John Samson &amp; he told me that he had a book
						of Palmstry when he lived at Goody
						Hoars w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. &amp;
						he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since &amp; had not seen it
						since

						Abig. Hobbs . you are brought before
						Authority to answere to sundry acts of witchcraft, committed by you against
						and upon the bodies of many, of which severall persons now accuse you. What
						say you? Are you guilty, or not? Speak the truth. I will speak the truth. I have seen sights and been scared. I have been very
						wicked. I hope I shall be better, if God will help me. What sights did you see? I have seen dogs and many creatures. What dogs do you mean, ordinary dogs? I mean the Devil. How often, many times? But once. Tell the truth. I do tell no lye. What appearance was he in then? Like a man. Where was it? It was at the Eastward at Casko-bay. Where, in the house, or in the woods? In the woods. In the night or in the day? In the day. How long agoe? About 3 or 4 years agoe. What did he say to you?  He said he would give me fine things, if I did what he would have me. What would he have you do? Why, he would have me be a witch. Would he have you make a covenant w'th him? Yes. And did you make a covenant with him? Yes, I did, but I hope God will forgive me. The Lord give you Repentance. You say you saw dogs, and many sorts of creatures. I saw them at that time. But have you not seen them at other times too? Yes. Wher? At our house. What were they like? Like a cat. What would the cat have you do? She had a book and would have me put my hand to it. And did you? No, I did not. Well, tell the truth, did you at any other time? Yes, I did, that time at the Eastward. What other creatures did you see? I saw things like men. What did they say to you? Why they said I had better put my hand to the Book. You did put your hand to the book you say? Yes, one time. What, would they have you put your hand to their book too? Yes. And what would they have you do then, would they have you worship them? They would have me make a bargain for so long, and do what they would have me
						do. For how long? Not for above 2 or 3 years. How long did they agree with you for? But for (2) two years.  And what would they then do for you? They would give me fine clothes. And did they? No. When you set your hand the last time to book, how long was that for? It was for (4) years. How long is that agoe? It is almost 4 years. The book was brought to me to get my hand to it for 4
						years, but I never put my hand but that once at Eastward. Are you not bid to hurt folks? Yes. Who are you bid to hurt? Mercy Lewes and Ann Putman. What did you do to them when you hurt them? I pinch't them. How did you pinch them, do you goe in your own person to them? No. Doth the Devil go for you? Yes. And what doth he take, your spirit with him? No. I am as well as at other times: but the Devil has my consent, and goes
						and hurts them. Who hurt your mother last Lord's day, was it not you? No. Who was it? I heard her say it was Goody Wilds at
						Topsfield. Have you been in company with Goody
						Wilds at any time? No, I never saw her. Well, who are your companions? Why I have seen Sarah Good once. How many did you see? I saw but two. Did you know Sarah Good was a witch,
						when you saw her? Yes. How did you know it? The Devil told me. Who was the other you saw?  I do not remember her name. Did you go and do hurt with Sarah
						Good ? No, she would have me set my hand to her book also. What mark did you make in the Devil's book
						when you set your hand to it? I made a mark. What mark? Have you not been at other great meetings? No. Did you not hear of great hurt done here in the village? Yes. And were you never with them? No, I was never with them. But you know your shape appeared and hurt the people here. Yes. How did you know? The Devil told me, if I gave consent, he would do it in my shape. How long agoe? About a fortnight agoe. What shape did the Devil appear in then? Like a black man with an hat. Do not some creatures suck your body? No. Where do they come, to what parts, when they come to your body? They do not come to my body, they come only in sight. Do they speak to you? Yes. How do they speak to you? As other folks. What do they speak to you, as other folks? Yes, almost. Then other questions were propounded to her, but she was taken D E A F: and
							Mary Walcot , Mercy Lewes, Betty Hubbard, Abig. Williams and Ann Putman
							jun'r , said they saw Sarah
						Good and Sarah Osborn run
						their fingers into the examinant's ears; by and by, she this examinant was
						blind, with her eyes quite open. A little after, she spake and said, Sarah
							Good saith I shall not speak; And so the Court ordered her, being
						seized with dumbness, to be taken away.  Note. The afflicted, i.e., the bewitched persons, were none of them tormented
						during the whole examination of this accused and confessing person, Abigail Hobbs . Note. -- After this examination, Mercy
						Lewes, Abigail Williams , and
							Ann Putman , three of the
						sufferers, said openly in Court, they were sorry for the condition this poor

						compassion they expressed over and over again. SALEM VILLAGE, April the 19th,

						31. May. 1692 
						
					Mercy Lewis &amp; Mary Walcot fell in a fit quickly
						after the examinant came in 
						Mary Walcot said that this woman the
						examinant had pincht her &amp; choakt this month. Ann Putman said she had hurt her three times. What say you to this charge? Here are them that charge you with witchcraft It it was the last moment I was to live, God knows I am innocent of any thing
						in this nature Did not you take notice that now when you lookt upon Mercy Lewis she was struck [down?] I cannot help it. You are charged here; what doe you say? I am innocent of any thing of this nature. Is this the first time that ever you were accused? Yes S'r. Do not you know that one at Ipswitch hath accused you? This is the first time that ever I heard of it You say that you never heard of these folks before Mercy Lewis at length spake &amp;
						charged this woman with hurting &amp; pinching her: And then Abigail Williams cryed she hath hurt
						me a great many times, a great while &amp; she hath brought me the book. 
						Ann Putman had a pin stuck in her
						hand What do you say to this? I cannot help it. What consent have you given? Mary Warren cryed out she was prickt 
						Abig: Williams cryed out that she
						was pincht, &amp; great printes were seen in her arm. Have not you seen some apparition -- No, never in all my life Those that have confessed, they tell us they used images &amp; pins, now
						tell us what you have used. You would not have me confess that which I know not She lookt upon Mary Warren, &amp;
						said Warren violently fell down. Look upon this maid viz: Mary Walcot
						, her back being towards the examinant Mary
							Warren &amp; Ann Putman said they saw this woman upon her.
							Susan: Sheldon saith this was
						the woman that carryed  her yesterday to the Pond Sus: Sheldon carried to the Examinant
						in a fit &amp; was well upon grasping her arm. You said you never heard before of these people Not before the warrant was served upon me last Sabbath day 
						John Indian cryed out O she bites,
						&amp; fell into a grevious fit, &amp; so carried to her in his fit
						&amp; was well upon her grasping him. What do you say to these things, they cannot come to you? S'r. I am not able to give account of it Cannot you tell what keeps them off from your body? I cannot tell, I know not what it is? That is strange that you should do these things &amp; not be able to tell
						how. This is a true account of the examination of Eliz: How taken from my characters written at the time thereof.

						10 May. 1692 
					Here are them that accuse you of acts of witchcraft Well, let us hear who are they, and what are they. 
						Abigail Williams - Jacobs laught.  Because I am falsely accused. -- Your worships all of you do you think this
						is true? Nay, what do you think? I never did it. who did it? Dont ask me. Why should we not ask you? Sarah
						Churchwell accuseth you, there she is. I am as innocent as the Child born to night, I have lived. 33. years here in
						Salem. What then? If you can prove that I am guilty, I will lye under it, Sarah Churchwell said last night I was afflicted at Deacon Ingersolls , and Mary Walcot said it was a man with 2 staves, it was
						my master. Pray do not accuse me, I am as clear as your worships; you must do right
						judgments. What book did he bring you Sarah? The same that the other woman brought. The Devill can go in any shape. Did he not [be] appear on the other side of the river and hurt you, did not
						you see him. Yes he did. Look there, she accuseth you to your face, she chargeth you that you hurt her
						twise. Is it not true? What would you have me say? I never wronged no man in word nor deed. Here are 3 evidences. You tax me for a wizard, you may as well tax me for a buzard I have done no
						harm. Is it no harm to afflict these? I never did it. But how comes it to be in your appearance? The Devil can taken any likeness. Not without their consent. Please your worship it is untrue, I never showed the book, I am as silly
						about these things as the child born last night. That is your Saying, you argue you have lived so long, but what then Cain
						might live long before he killed Abel, and you might live long before the
							Devill had so prevailed on you.  Christ hath suffered 3 times for me. What three times. He suffered the Crosse &amp; gall -- You had as good confesse (said Sarah
							Churchwell) if you are guilty. Have you heard that I have any witchcraft? I know you lived a wicked life. Let her make it out. Doth he ever pray in his family? Not unless by himself. Why do you not pray in your family? I cannot read. Well but you may pray for all that. Can you say the Lords prayer? Let us hear you? He mist in severall parts of it, and could not repeat it right after Many
						Trialls Sarah Churchwell, when you wrote in
						the book you was showed your masters name you said. Yes Sir. If she say so, if you do not know it, what will you say? But she saw you, or your likeness tempt her to write. one in my likeness, the Devil may present my likeness. Were you not frighted Sarah
						Churchwell, when the representation of your master came to you? Yes. Well: burn me, or hang me, I will stand in the truth of Christ, I know
						nothing of it. Do you know nothing of getting your son George and his daughter Margaret to signe? No nothing at all. The 2d Examination of said George
						Jacobs 11. May, 1692. The bewitched fell into most grevious fits and screhings when he came in. Is this the man that hurts you? 
						Abig Williams cryed out this is the
						man and fell into a violent fit. 
						Ann Putman said this is the man,
						and he hurts her, and brings the book to her, and would have her write in
						the book, and she should be as well as his Grand daughter. Mercy Lewis is this the man?  This is the man (after much interruption by fits) he almost kills me. Eliz: Hubbard said the man never hurt
						her till to day he came upon the Table. 
						Mary Walcot is this the man? After much interruption by fits she said this is the man, he used to come
						with two staves and beat her with one of them. What do you say, are you not a witch? No I know it not, if I were to dye presently. Mercy Lewes went to come near him but
						fell into great fits. Mercy Lewes testimony read. What do
						you say to this? Why it is false, I know not of it, any more than the child that was born to
						night. 
						Ann Putman said yes, you told me
						so, that you had been so this: 40 years. 
						Ann Putman and Abigail Williams had each of them a pin stuck in
						their hands, and they said it was this old Jacobs . 
						Abigail Williams Testimony read. Are not you the man that made disturbance at a Lecture in Salem. No great disturbance. Do you think I use witchcraft? Yes indeed No I use none of them. (Reverse) The Examination of Geo: Jacobs,

						Honoured Father, 
					After my Humble Duty Remmbered to you, hoping in the Lord of your good
						Health, as Blessed be God I enjoy, tho in abundance of Affliction, being
						close Confined here in a loathsome Dungeon, the Lord look down in mercy upon
						me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted
						Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized
						for the King. The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the
						Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed
						several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding
						of my own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded
						Conscience who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on
						in my Sins, but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in
						any longer, but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the
						Magistrates, who would not believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in
						here, and God knows how soon I shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me
						beg your Prayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy
						meeting in Heaven. My Mother poor Woman is very Crazey, and 
						remembers her kind Love to you, and to Uncle, viz. 
						D. A. So leaving you to the protection of the Lord, I rest your Dutiful
						Daughter,

						Jacobs unto the honoured court now sitting at Salem, sheweth That whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely confined here in
						Salem goal for the crime of witchcraft, which crime thanks be to the Lord I
						am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment: May
						it please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the possessed
						persons, as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination,
						which persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much startle and
						affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least measure, how
						or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else they would
						not fall down at me; they told me, if I would not confess, I should be put
						down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should
						have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart,
						to save my life; made me make the like confession I did, which confession,
						may it please the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very
						first night after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience
						that I could not sleep for fear the devil should carry me away for telling
						such horrid lies. I was, may it please the honoured court, sworn to my
						confession, as I understand since, but then, at that time, was ignorant of
						it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I trust,
						out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false forswearing
						myself. What I said, was altogether false against my grandfather, and Mr. Burroughs , which I did to save my
						life and to have my liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience,
						made me in so much horror, that I could not contain myself before I had
						denied my confession, which I did though I saw nothing but death before  me, chusing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live
						in such horror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my
						confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more
						felicity in spirit, a thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement. And now, may it please your honours, your declarant, having, in part, given
						your honours a description of my condition, do leave it to your honours
						pious and judicious discretions, to take pity and compassion on my young and
						tender years, to act and do with me, as the Lord above and your honours
						shall see good, having no friend, but the Lord, to plead my cause for me;
						not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft, nor any
						other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant
						shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for your honours happiness in
						this life and eternal felicity in the world to come. So prays your honours
						declarant.

						21st July, 1692. 
						Before Major Gidney , Mr. Hawthorne , Mr. Corwin and Capt. Higginson .Q. Goody Foster! you remember we have
						three times spoken with you, and do you now remember what you then confessed
						to us? -- You have been engaged in very great wickedness, and some have been
						left to hardness of heart to deny; but it seems that God will give you more
						favour than others, inasmuch as you relent. But your daughter here hath
						confessed some things that you did not tell us of. Your daughter was with
						you and Goody Carrier, when you did ride upon the stick. A.
						I did not know it. Q. How long have you known your daughter to be engaged?
						A. I cannot tell, nor have I any knowledge of it at all. Q. Did you see your
						daughter at the meeting? A. No. Q. Your daughter said she was at the witches
						meeting, and that you yourself stood at a distance off and did not partake
						at that meeting; and you said so also; give us a relation from the beginning
						until now. A. I know none of their names that were there, but only Goody
						Carrier. Q. Would you know their faces if you saw them? A.
						I cannot tell. Q. Where there not two companies in the field at the same
						time? A. I remember no more. -- Mary
						Warren, one of the afflicted, said that Goody
						Carrier's shape told her, that Goody Foster had made her daughter a witch. -- Q. Do
						not you acknowledge that you did so about 13 years ago? A. No, and I know no
						more of my daughter's being a witch than what day I shall die upon. Q. Are
						you willing your daughter should make a full and free confession? A. Yes. Q.
						Are you willing to do so too? A. Yes. Q. You cannot expect peace of
						conscience without a free confession. A. If I knew any thing more, I would
						speak it to the utmost. -- Goody Lacey, the daughter, called in, began thus;
						Oh! mother! how do you do? We have left Christ, and the devil hath gat hold
						of us. How shall I get rid of this evil one? I desire God to break my rocky
						heart that I may get the victory this time. Q. Goody Foster! you cannot get rid of this snare, your
						heart and mouth is not open. A. I did not see the devil, I was praying to
						the Lord. Q. What Lord? A. To God. Q. What God do witches pray to? A. I
						cannot tell, the Lord help me. Q. Goody Lacey! had you no
						discourse with your mother when riding? A. No, I think I had not a word. Q.
						Who rid foremost on that stick to the village? A. I suppose  my
						mother. -- Goody Foster said, that
						Goody Carrier was foremost -- Q. Goody Lacey!  how many
						years ago since they were baptized? A. Three or four years ago, I suppose.
						Q. Who baptized them? A. The old serpent. Q. How did he do it? A. He dipped
						their heads in the water, saying, they were his and that he had power over
						them. Q. Where was this? A. At Fall's river. Q. How many were baptized that
						day? A. Some of the chief; I think they were six baptized. Q. Name them. A.
						I think they were of the higher powers. -- Mary Lacey , the grand-daughter, was brought in, and Mary Warren fell into a violent fit.
						Q. How dare you come in here, and bring the devil with you to afflict these
						poor creatures? -- Lacey laid her hand on Warren's arm, and she recovered from her fit. -- Q. You are here
						accused of practising witchcraft upon Goody Ballard; which way do you do it? A. I cannot tell. Where
						is my mother that made me a witch, and I knew it not? Q. Can you look upon
						that maid Mary Warren, and not hurt
						her? Look upon her in a friendly way. -- She, trying so to do, struck her
						down with her eyes. Q. Do you acknowledge now you are a witch? A. Yes. Q.
						How long have you been a witch? A. Not above a week. Q. Did the devil appear
						to you? A. Yes. Q. In what shape? A. In the shape of a horse. Q. What did he
						say to you? A. He bid me not to be afraid of any thing, and he would not
						bring me out, but he has proved a liar from the beginning. Q. When was this?
						A. I know not; above a week. Q. Did you set your hand to the book? A. No. Q.
						Did he bid you worship him? A. Yes, he bid me also afflict persons. -- You
						are now in the way to obtain mercy if you will confess and repent. She said,
						the Lord help me. Q. Do not you desire to be saved by Christ? A. Yes. --
						Then you must confess freely what you know in this matter. She then
						proceeded. -- I was in bed and the devil came to me and bid me obey him and
						I should want for nothing, and he would not bring me out. Q. But how long
						ago? A. A Little more than a year. Q. Was that the first time? A. Yes. Q.
						How long was you gone from your father, when you ran away? A. Two days. Q.
						Where had you your food? A. At John
						Stone's . Q. Did the Devil appear to you then, when you was abroad?
						A. No, but he put such thoughts in my mind as not to obey my parents. Q. Who
						did the devil bid you afflict? A. Timothy
							Swan . Richard Carrier
						comes often a nights and has me to afflict persons. Q. Where do ye go? A. To
							Goody Ballard's sometimes. Q.
						How many of you were there at a time? A. Richard Carrier and his mother, and my mother and grandmother.
							 -- Uponeading over the confession so far, Goody Lacey , the mother, owned this
						last particular. Q. How many more witches are there in Andover? A. I know no
						more, but Richard Carrier .

Why it is you, or your appearance. I cannot help it. That may be your Master. I desire to lead my self according to the word of God. Is this according to Gods word? If I were such. a person I would tell you the truth. How comes your appearance just now to hurt these. How do I know? Are not you willing to tell the Truth? I cannot tell: He that appeared in sams shape a glorifyed saint can appear in

						Mr. Harthorn. What do you say
						(speaking to one afflicted) have you seen this Woman hurt you? Yes, she beat me this morning 
						Abigial . Have you been hurt by this
						Woman? Yes 
						Ann Putman in a grievous fit cryed
						out that she hurt her. 
						Goody Nurse , here are two An: Putman the child &amp; Abigail Williams complains of your
						hurting them What do you say to it N. I can say before my Eternal father I am innocent, &amp; God will clear
						my innocency Here is never a one in the Assembly but desires it, but if you be guilty Pray
						God discover you. Then Hen: Kenny rose up to speak 
						Goodm: Kenny what do you say Then he entered his complaint &amp; farther said that since this Nurse came into the house he was seizd
						twise with an amaz'd condition Here are not only these but, here is the wife of Mr Tho: Putman who accuseth you by credible
						information &amp; that both of tempting her to iniquity, &amp; of
						greatly hurting her. N. I am innocent &amp; clear &amp; have not been able to get out of
						doors these 8. or 9. dayes. 
						Mr Putman: give in what you have to
						say Then Mr Edward Putman gave in his
						relate Is this true Goody Nurse
					I never afflicted no child never in my life  You see these accuse you, is it true No. Are you an innocent person relating to this Witchcraft. Here Tho: Putmans wife cryed out, Did
						you not bring the Black man with you, did you not bid me tempt God &amp;
						dye How oft have you eat and drunk y'r own damaon What do you say to them Oh Lord help me, &amp; spread out her hands, &amp; the afflicted were
						greviously vexed Do you not see what a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are
						loose the pesons are afflicted. Then Mary Walcot (who often
						heretofore said she had seen her, but never could say or did say that she
						either bit or pincht her, or hurt her) &amp; also Eliz: Hubbard under the like circumstances both
						openly accused her of hurting them Here are these 2 grown persons now accuse you, w't say you? Do not you see
						these afflicted persons, &amp; hear them accuse you. The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am an innocent person It is very awfull to all to see these agonies &amp; you an old Professor
						thus charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it
						&amp; yet to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet -- You do not know my heart You would do well if you are guilty to confess &amp; give Glory to God I am as clear as the child unborn What uncertainty there may be in apparitions I know not, yet this with me
						strikes hard upon you that you are at this very present charged with
						familiar spirits: this is your bodily person they speak to: they say now
						they see these familiar spirits com to your bodily #[spirits com to your
						bodily] person, now what do you say to that I have none Sir: If you have confess &amp; give glory to God I pray God clear you if you
						be innocent, &amp; if you are guilty discover you And therefore give me
						an upright answer: have you any familiarity with these spirits? No, I have none but with God alone. How came you sick for there is an odd discourse of that in the mouths of many
						-- I am sick at my stumach -- Have you no wounds  I have none but old age You do Know whither you are guilty, &amp; have familiarity with the
						Devil, &amp; now when you are here present to see such a thing as these
						testify a black man whispering in your ear, &amp; birds about you what
						do you say to it It is all false I am clear Possibly you may apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led aside
						by temptations that way I have not What a sad thing it is that a church member here &amp; now an other of
						Salem, should be thus accused and charged 
						Mrs Pope fell into a grevious fit,
						&amp; cryed out a sad thing sure enough: And then many more fell into
						lamentable fits. Tell us have not you had visible appearances more than what is common in
						nature? I have noe nor never had in my life Do you think these suffer voluntary or involuntary I cannot tell That is strange every one can judge I must be silent They accuse you of hurting them, &amp; if you think it is not unwillingly
						but by designe, you must look upon them as murderers I cannot tell what to think of it Afterwards when this was som what insisted on she said I do not think so: she
						did not understand aright what was said Well then give an answer now, do you think these suffer against their wills
						or not I do not think these suffer against their wills Why did you never visit these afflicted persons Because I was afraid I should have fits too Note Upon the motion of her body fitts followed upon
						the complainants abundantly &amp; very frequently Is it not an unaccountable case that when you are examined these persons are
						afflicted? I have got no body to look to but God Again upon stirring her hands the afflicted persons were seized with violent
						fits of torture Do you beleive these afflicted persons are bewitcht
					I do think they are  When this Witchcraft came upon the stage there was no suspicion of Tituba ( Mr Paris's Indian woman) she profest much love to
						that child Betty Paris , but it was
						her apparition did the mischief, &amp; why should not you also be
						guilty, for your apparition doth hurt also. Would you have me bely my self -- she held her Neck on one side, &amp; accordingly so were the afflicted
						taken Then Authority requiring it Sam:
						Paris read what he had in characters taken from Mr Tho: Putmans wife in her fitts
					What do you think of this I cannot help it, the Devil may appear in my shape. This a true account of the sume of her examination but by reason of geat
						noyses by the afflicted &amp; many speakers, many things are
						pretermitted Memorandum Nurse held her neck on one sid &amp; Eliz: Hubbard (one of the sufferers) had her neck set in that
						posture whereupon another Patient Abigail
							Williams cryed out set up Goody
							Nurses head the maid's neck will be broke &amp; when some set
						up Nurses head Aaron Wey observed that Betty Hubbards was immediately righted

						Juryman) 
						
							July  4, 1692.  I Thomas Fisk , the Subscriber hereof, being one of
						them that were of the Jury the last week at Salem-Court, upon the Tryal of
							Rebecka Nurse,  etc., being
						desired by some of the Relations to give a Reason why the Jury brought her
						in Guilty, after her Verdict not Guilty; I do hereby give my Reasons to be
						as follows, viz. 
					When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object
						against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which
						the Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply
						to Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter , who had been faulty in
						setting their hands to the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the
						words were “What, do these persons give in Evidence against me
						now, they used to come among us.” After the honoured Court had
						manifested their dissatisfaction of the  Verdict, several of
						the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon the
						honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the Case, I could
						not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a
						further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and
						then going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the
						Court were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar,
						but made no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to
						me a principal Evidence against her.

Sept. 92.)  of Mary
						Osgood , wife of Captain
						Osgood of Andover, taken before John
							Hawthorne  and other their Majesties justices. She confesses, that about 11 years ago, when she was in a melancholy state
						and condition, she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain
						time, she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of the house, which yet
						she thought was a real cat. However, at that time, it diverted her from
						praying to God, and instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which
						time she made a covenant with the devil, who, as a black man, came to her
						and presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger and that left a red
						spot: And that upon her signing, the devil told her he was her God, and that
						she should serve and worship him, and, she believes, she consented to it.
						She says further, that about two years agone, she was carried through the
						air, in company with deacon Frye's
						wife , Ebenezer Baker's wife
						, and Goody Tyler , to five mile
						pond, where she was baptized by the devil, who dipped her face in the water
						and made her renounce her former baptism, and told her she must be his, soul
						and body, forever, and that she must serve him, which she promised to do.
						She says, the renouncing her first baptism was after her dipping, and that
						she was transported back again through the air, in company with the
						forenamed persons, in the same manner as she went, and believes they were
						carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the pole? A. As I said
						before, viz. four persons and no more but whom she had named above. -- She
						confesses she has afflicted three persons, John Sawdy , Martha
						Sprague and Rose Foster , and
						that she did it by pinching her bed clothes, and giving consent the devil
						should do it in her shape, and that the devil could not do it without her
						consent. -- She confesses the afflicting persons in the court, by the glance
						of her eye. She says, as she was coming down to Salem to be 
						examined, she and the rest of the company with her, stopped at Mr.
						Phillips's  to refresh themselves, and the afflicted
						persons, being behind them upon the road, came up just as she was mounting
						again and were then afflicted, and cried out upon her, so that she was
						forced to stay until they were all past, and said she only looked that way
						towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape of an innocent
						person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this way of
						witchcraft? A. Satan, and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction and
						quietness in her future state, but never performed any thing; and that she
						has lived more miserably and more discontented since, than ever before. She
						confesses further, that she herself, in company with Goody Parker , Goody Tyler , and Goody Dean  , had a meeting
						at Moses Tyler's house, last monday
						night, to afflict, and that she and Goody Dean  carried the
						shape of Mr. Dean,  the minister, between them, to make
						persons believe that Mr. Dean  afflicted. Q. What hindered
						you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not suffer it so
						to be, that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. Have
						you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof, as I shall
						answer in the presence of God and his people; but said, that the black man
						stood before her, and told her, that what she had confessed was a lie;
						notwithstanding, she said that what she had confessed was true, and thereto
						put her hand. Her husband being present was asked, if he judged his wife to
						be any way discomposed. He answered, that having lived with her so long, he
						doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed, but has cause to believe what
						she has said is true. -- When Mistress
							Osgood was first called, she afflicted Martha Sprague and Rose Foster , by the glance of her eyes, and recovered them out
						of their fits by the touch of her hand. Mary Lacey and Betty
						Johnson and Hannah Post saw
							Mistress Osgood afflicting Sprague and Foster . -- The said Hannah Post and Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson,
							jun. and Rose Foster and
							Mary Richardson were afflicted
						by Mistress Osgood , in the time of
						their examination, and recovered by her touching of their hands. I underwritten, being appointed by authority, to take this examination, do
						testify upon oath, taken in court, that this is a true copy of the substance
						of it, to the best of my knowledge, 
						5 Jan1692 -- 3. The
						within Mary Osgood was examined

and Abigail
							Barker ) 
						
							To the honoured court of Assize held at Salem,
								The humble address of several of the inhabitants 
							of Andover. 
						
						May it please this honoured court, 
					We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long
						under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that
						great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it
						our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them
						will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to
						speak something at present are Mrs. Mary
							Osgood , Eunice Frye ,
							Deliverance Dane , Sarah Wilson and Abigail Barker , who are women of whom we can truly
						give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us
						so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to
						suspect them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary
						conversation have obtained a good report in the place, where they have been
						well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members. We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were
						accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent
						were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were
						accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and
						others, tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have
						thought any evil of them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of
						that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people, took
						great pains to persuade them to own what they were, by the afflicted,
						charged with, and, indeed, did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves
						guilty, as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good
						women did very much assert their innocency, yet some of them said they were
						not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them, because there was
						that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain
						indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they seriously professed they
						knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, by the unwearied
						sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both  at
						home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they
						were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and
						believe they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event
						might be, and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that
						confessing was the only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a
						temptation for timorous women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction
						that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves
						proceeded from conviction of the fact, we should have had nothing to have
						said for them, but we are induced to think that it did not, because they did
						soon privately retract what they had said, as we are informed, and, while
						they were in prison, they declared to such as they had confidence to speak
						freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what they had owned, and
						that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden
						they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful
						for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, considering
						the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us, and
						what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, we
						cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that
						hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under
						the like circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of
						them that while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such
						persons as, of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do
						we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of
						that evil that they are now charged with.

							John Londer being by attested
						the same the Marshal had before. Mary

						Glance of Parkers Ey she immediately
						struck her down into a fitt. being Examined upon
						these things, she wished God would open the Earth and Swallow her up
						presently, if one word of this was true and make her an Example to Others --
						Tho att the same times she practised her Witchcrafts before upon the Body of
							Mary Warren, dreadfully
						tormenting her. Moreover Warren
						affirmed that she told her this day that she was att the Bloody Sacrament in
							Mr Parris's Pasture, and [that]
						they were about thirty of them. Mary
						Warren also affirms that She told her this day also that she Ran
						after John Londer in the Common.
							Mary Warren affirms that the
						Spectrum came direct from her Body and afflicted her dureing the whole time
						off her Examination. Mr Noise  in Time of Examination
						affirmed to her face, that he being with her in a Time of sicknes,
						discoursing with about her witchcrafts whether she were not Guilty, she
						answered If she was as free from other sins as from Witchcrafts she would
						not ask the Lord mercy. Mary. Warren
						being taken with a dreadful fit at the same time, w'rby her tongue hung out
						of her mouth until it was black, Parker being present said warrens tongue would be blacker befor she

					the humble Petition of John Parker,
						&amp; Joseph Parker  of Andover
						sheweth, That whereas our mother mary Parker
						of Andover, was apprehended upon suspition of witchcraft, and being brought
						to a tryall at Salem Court, was condemned: since her death the sherriff of
						Essex sent an officer to seise on her estate. The said officer required us
						in their majestyes name to give him an Account of our mothers estate,
						pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told him that our mother left no
						estate; (which we are able to make appear) notwithstanding which, he seised
						upon our cattell, Corn &amp; hay, to a considerable value; and ordered
						us to go down to Salem and make an agreement with the sherrife, otherwise
						the estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing what advantage the Law
						might give him against us, and fearing we should sustain greater Damage by
						the loss of our Estate, went to the sherriff accordingly, who told us he
						might take away all that was seised. if he pleased, but was willing to do us
						a kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded
						ten pounds of us, but at length was willing to take Six pounds, which he has
							 obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our
						Mother had left any Estate, we know not of any Law in force in this
						Province, by which it should be forfeited upon her condemnation; much less
						can we understand that there is any Justice or reason, for the sherriff to
						seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our own act has obliged us to pay
						him a Summ of money, yet we declare that we were drawn to it partly by the
						officers great pretences of Law for what he did, partly to prevent the loss
						of our estate which we feard would be immediately sold. How we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case, and if it be
						judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us, upon the
						forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that
						obligation, which the sherriff, taking advantage of our ignorance hath
						brough us under And yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray
						&amp;c --

						you? A. she brought the book to me. Q. John! tell the truth, who hurts you?
						have you been hurt? A. The first, was a gentlewoman I saw. Q. Who next? A.
							Goody Cloyse . Q. But who hurt
						you next? A. Goody Procter . Q. What
						did she do to you? A. She choaked me, and brought the book. Q. How oft did
						she come to torment you? A. A good many times, she and Goody Cloyse . Q. Do they come to you in the night
						as well as the day? A. They come most in the day. Q. Who? A. Goody Cloyse and Goody Procter . Q. Where did she take hold of you?
						A. Upon my throat, to stop my breath. Q. Do you know Goody Cloyse and Goody Proctor ? A. Yes, here is  Goody Cloyse . (Cloyse) when did I hurt thee? A. A great many
						times. (Cloyse) Oh! you are a grievous liar. Q. What did this  Goody Cloyse do to you? A. She
						pinched and bit me till the blood came. Q. How long since this woman came
						and hurt you? A. Yesterday at meeting. Q. At any time before? A. Yes a great
						many times. Q. Mary Walcot! who
						hurts you? A. Goody Cloyse. Q. What
						did she do to you? A. She hurt me. Q. Did she bring the book? A. Yes. Q.
						What was you to do with it? A. To touch it, and be well. -- Then she fell
						into a fit. Q. Doth she come alone? A. Sometimes alone, and sometimes in
						company with Goody Nurse and Goody Corey , and a great many I do
						not know. -- Then she fell into a fit again. -- Q. Abigail Williams! did you see a company at Mr. Parris's house eat and drink? A.
						Yes Sir, that was their sacrament. Q. How many were there? A. About forty,
						and Goody Cloyse and Goody Good were their deacons. Q. What
						was it? A. They said it was our blood, and they had it twice that day. Q.
							Mary Walcot! have you seen a
						white man? Yes, Sir, a great many times. Q. What sort of man was he? A. A
						fine grave man, and when he came, he made all the witches to tremble. --
							Abigail Williams confirmed the
						same, and that they had such a sight at Deacon Ingersoll's . Q. Who was at Deacon Ingersoll's then? A. Goody Cloyse , Goody Nurse , Goody
						Corey , and Goody Good . --
						Then Sarah Cloyse asked for water,
						and sat down as one seized with a dying fainting fit; and several of the
						afflicted fell into fits, and some of them cried out, Oh! her spirit is gone
						to prison to her sister Nurse . --
						Q. Elizabeth Procter ! you
						understand whereof you are charged, viz. to be guilty of sundry acts of
						witchcraft; what say you to it? Speak the truth, and so you that are
						afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you will answer it before God
						another day. Mary Walcot! doth this
						woman hurt you? A. I never saw her so as to be hurt by her. Q. Mary Lewis! does she hurt you? -- Her
						mouth was  stopped. -- Q. Ann
							Putman , does she hurt you? -- She could not speak. -- Q. Abigail Williams! does she hurt you?
						-- Her hand was thrust in her own mouth. -- Q. John! does she hurt you? A.
						This is the woman that came in her shift and choaked me. Q. did she ever
						bring the book? A. Yes, Sir. Q. What to do? A. to write. Q. What, this
						woman? A. Yes, Sir. Q. Are you sure of it? A. Yes, Sir. -- Again, Abigail Williams and Ann Putman were spoke to by the
						court, but neither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or
						other fits. Q. What do you say Goody
							Procter to these things? A. I take God in heaven to be my
						witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child unborn. Q. Ann Putman! doth this woman hurt you.
						A. Yes Sir, a great many times. -- Then the accused looked upon them and
						they fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A.
						Yes, Sir, often, and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it. Q.
							Abigail Williams! does this
						woman hurt you? A. Yes, Sir, often. Q. Does she bring the book to you? A.
						Yes. Q. What would she have you do with it? A. To write in it and I shall be
						well. -- Did not you, said Abigal, tell me, that your maid had written?
							(Procter) Dear Child, it is not
						so. There is another judgement, dear child. -- Then Abigail and Ann had fits. -- By and by they cried out, look you there is Goody Procter upon the beam. -- By and
						by, both of them cried out of Goodman
							Procter himself, and said he was a wizard. -- Immediately, many,
						if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. -- Q. Ann Putman! who hurt
						you? A. Goodman Procter and his wife
						too. -- Afterwards some of the afflicted cried, there is Procter going to take up Mrs. Pope's feet. -- And her feet were immediately
						taken up. -- Q. What do you say Goodman
							Proctor to these things? A. I know not, I am innocent. -- Abigail Williams cried out, there is
							Goodman Procter going to Mrs. Pope , and immediately, said
							Pope fell into a fit. -- You see
						the devil will deceive you; the children could see what you was going to do
						before the woman was hurt. I would advise you to repentance, for the devil
						is bringing you out. -- Abigail
						Williams cried out again, there is Goodman Procter going to hurt Goody Bibber; and immediatelyGoody Bibber fell into a fit. There was the like of Mary Walcot , and divers others. --
							Benjamin Gould gave in his
						testimony, that he had seen Goodman
						Corey and his wife, Procter
						and his wife, Goody Cloyse , Goody Nurse , and Goody Griggs in his chamber last thursday night. --
							Elizabeth Hubbard was in a
						trance during the whole examination. -- During the examination of Elizabeth Procter , Abigail Williams and Ann Putman ,  both made
						offer to strike at said Procter ;
						but when Abigail's hand came near,
						it opened, whereas it was made up into a fist before, and came done
						exceeding lightly, as it drew near to said Procter , and at length with open and extended fingers, touched
							Procter's hood very lightly.
						Immediately Abigail cried out, her
						fingers, her fingers, burned, and Ann
							Putman took on most greviously, of her head, and sunk down. Salem, April 11th,
						1692. Mr. Samuel Parris was
						desired by the honourable Thomas
						Danforth , deputy-governor, and the council, to take in writing the
						aforesaid examinations, and accordingly took and delivered them in; and upon
						hearing the same, and seeing what was then seen, together with the charge of
						the afflicted persons, were by the advice of the council all committed by
						us,

							Procter  &amp; his wife now in Trouble &amp; und'r
						Suspition of Witchcraft. Too the Hon'rable Court of Assistants now Sitting In Boston. -- Hon'red &amp; Right Worshipfull! The foresd John Procter may have
						Great Reason to Justifie the Divine Sovereigntie of God under thos Severe
						Remarques of Providence upon his Peac &amp; Hon'r und'r a due Reflection
						upon his Life Past: And so the Best of us have Reason to Adoar the Great
						Pittie &amp; Indulgenc of Gods Providenc, that we are not Exposed to the
						utmost shame, that the Divell can Invent und'r the
						p'rmissions of Sovereigntie, tho not for that Sin fore Named; yet for o'r
						many Transgretions; for we Do at present Suppose that it may be A Method
						w'thin the Seveerer But Just Transaction of the Infinite Majestie of God:
						that he some times may p'rmitt Sathan to p'rsonate, Dissemble, &amp;
						therby abuse Inocents, &amp; such as Do in the fear of God Defie the
							Devill and all his works. The Great Rage he is
						p'rmitted to attempt holy Job w'th The Abuse he Does the famous Samuell, in
						Disquieting his Silent Dust, by Shaddowing his venerable P'rson in Answer

						&amp; other Instances from Good hands; may be arg'd Besides the
						unsearcheable foot stepps of Gods Judgments that are brought to Light Every
						Morning that Astonish o'r weaker Reasons, To teach us Adoration, Trembling.
						&amp; Dependanc, &amp;ca but -- We must not Trouble y'r Honr's by Being Tedious, Therefore we being Smitten
						with the Notice of what hath happened, we Recoon it w'thin the Duties of o'r
						Charitie, That Teacheth us to do, as we would be done by; to offer thus much
						for the Clearing of o'r Neighb'rs Inocencie; viz: That we never had the
						Least Knowledge of such a Nefarious wickedness in o'r said Neighbours, since
						they have been w'thin our acquaintance; Neither doe we remember -- any such
						Thoughts in us Concerning them; or any Action by them or either of them
						Directly tending that way; no more than might be in the lives of any other
						p'rsons of the Clearest Reputation as to Any such Evills. What God may have Left them to, we Cannot Go into Gods
						pavillions Cloathed w'th Cloudes of Darknesse Round About. But as to what we have ever seen, or heard of them -- upon o'r Consciences we
						Judge them Innocent of the crime objected. His Breading hath been Amongst us; and was of Religious Parents in o'r place;

									Mr. Mather,

									 , and Mr.
										Bailey
								. 
						
						
							Reverend Gentlemen . 
					The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and
						Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, having
						Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged
						against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable
						Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be
						possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will
						be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates,
						Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and
						incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no
						other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent
						Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be
						Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament,
						since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of
						the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till
						they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their
						Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of
						making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a
							 Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their
						Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son
							William Procter , when he was
						examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was
						Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his
						Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the
						rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions
						are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our
						Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods.
						If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg
						that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in
						their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if
						not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of
						saving the sheeding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord
						in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants, 
						
							JOHN PROCTER , etc.
