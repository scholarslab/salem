                <p>Conco Ia} 11. Sept. 1692. After ye condemnation of 6. Witches at a Court at
                    Salem, one of the Witches viz. Martha Kory in full communion with our
                    Church.</p>

                <p>17. Rev. 14.<br/> These shall make War with the Lamb, &amp; the Lamb shall
                    overcome them: For he is the Lord of Lords, &amp; King of Kings; And they that
                    are with him, are Called, &amp; Chosen, &amp; Faithful.</p>
            
                <p>In these words 2. things are observable.<br/>
                    
                    1. A War prophesyed of.<br/> 
                    2. The Victory that this was shall issue in.</p>

                <p>1. Here is mention made of a War. These shall make War &amp;c</p>

                <p>Now in all wars are two parties. And so here</p>

                    <p>1. Here is the Offending Party. Namely These, viz: Anti-christ (the spiritual
                        whole) &amp; all her Assistants, instruments of Satan, &amp; instigated by
                        that Dragon to this War. 13. Rev. 1.2. Namely By Sorceries &amp; witchcrafts
                        (plentiful among the Papacy) doing lying Wonders whereby multitudes were
                        deluded</p>
            
                    <p>2. Here is the Offended Party viz. the Lamb and his followers. Text. With
                        these they make War.</p>

                    <p>3. Here is the Victory, &amp; the Reason of the Victory.</p>

                        <span class="pb">page: 153</span>
            <p>The Devil &amp; his Instruments will be</p>
                            
                            <p>1. The Victory. Devils, &amp; Idolaters will make War with the Lamb,
                            &amp; his followers. But wo shall have the Victory? Why the Lamb (i.c.
                            Christ) &amp; his followers. Text</p>

                        <p>2. Here is the Reason of it, &amp; that is twofold</p>

                            <p>1. And main Reason is taken from the Lamb (Christ) For he is Lord, of
                                Lords &amp;c</p>
         
                            <p>2. Reason is taken from the Saints </p>

                        <p>3. Victorial Properties</p>

                            <p>1. They are Chosen</p>
                            <p>2. They are called.</p>

                            <p>3. Last: They are Faithfull: of which hereafter.</p>


                <p>1. Doctr. The Devil &amp; his Instruments will be making war with the Lamb &amp;
                    his Followers as long as they can.</p>

                <p>2. Doctr. The Lamb &amp; his Followers</p>
            <p>When do men make</p>
            
            <p>shall overcome the Devil &amp; his
                    Instruments in this War against them.</p>

                <p>1. Doctr. The Devil, &amp; his Instruments , will be making War, as long as they
                    can, with the Lamb &amp; his Followers.</p>

                    <p>Here are. 2. things in this Doctrine. Namely.</p>

                    <p>1. The Devil &amp; his Instruments will be warring against Christ &amp; his
                        followers.</p>

                    <p>2. This War will be as long as they can. It will not be for ever. There will
                        be a time wn they shall war no longer.</p>

                        <p>1. The Devil and his Instruments will be warring against Christ &amp; his
                            followers. Text. These shall make War with the Lamb. 11. Chap. 2. The
                            Beast shall make War against them. 12. Ch. 7. 17. War in heaven: The
                            Dragon fought and his Angels. 13. Chap. 7. It was given to him to make
                            war with the Saints. &amp;c. 19. Ch. 19.</p>

                        <p>We may father confirm this point by Instances &amp; Reasons</p>

                            <p>1. For Instances. We find the Devil Assaulting the Lamb as soon as he
                                was borne to the end of his dayes. As we see in his instrument
                                Herod. 2. Matth. 7&amp;c. And afterwards by his Manifold Temptations
                                of Christ in the Wilderness 4. Matt. And afterwards by his stirring
                                up the chief of the Jewes to kill Christ. 26. Matth. 3. 4. And to
                                help forward that murder the Devil puts it into the heart of one of
                                Christs Disciples to betray him. 13. Joh. 2. And after all tho the
                                Lamb be killed, but yet liveth for ever, &amp; no advantage got by
                                the Devil by the Murder of Christ, why now he seeks to destroy his
                                Church: And for this end influenceth bloody</p> 
            
                <span class="pb">page: 154</span> 
            <p>Warning ag'st.Christ &amp; his Followers</p>
            
                                <p>Saul to lay all waste.
                                8. Acts. 3. 9. Ch. 1. 2. But now when the Lamb had conquered this
                                bloody Instrument, &amp; of a Saul, made him Paul, a Preacher of
                                Righteousness why now the Devil as much opposeth Paul. 13. Acts. 4.
                                &amp;c. Yea the scripture is full of such instances. Church History
                                abounds also with evidences of this truth. Yea &amp; in our dayes,
                                How industrious &amp; vigorous is the Bloody French Monarch, &amp;
                                his Confederates against Christ &amp; his Interest? Yea, &amp; in
                                our Land (in this, &amp; some neighboring Places) how many, what
                                Multitudes, of Witches &amp; Wizards has the Devil instigated with
                                utmost violence to attempt the overthrow of Religion?</p>

                            <p>2. The Reason, that in a word is from the enmity of the Devil &amp;
                                his Instruments to Religion. 13. Acts. 10. Thou Child of the Devil,
                                thou enemy of all Righteousness. Now the seed of the Devil will do
                                the works of the Devil. 8. Joh. 44. Ye are of your Father the Devil,
                                &amp; the lusts of your Father ye will do &amp;c. Satan (sais one.
                                Trapp in loco) is called the God of this world, because as God at
                                first did but speak the word &amp; it was done: So if the Devil do
                                but hold up his finger, give the least hint of his Mind, his
                                Servants &amp; Slaves will obey.</p>

                        <p>2. This War shall be as long as they can. It shall not be for ever, &amp;
                            alwayes. Here</p>

                            <p>1. Sometimes the Devil looseth his Volunteers in War. The Lawful
                                Captive, the Captives of the Mighty, are sometimes delivered. 49.
                                Isa. 24. 25. We have an instance in bloody Saul. 9. Acts. 3.
                                &amp;c.</p>

                            <p>2. Sometimes the Devil is chained up; s that he cannot head &amp;
                                forme an Army, as otherwise he would against the Saints. 20. Rev. 1.
                                2. 3.</p>

                            <p>3. Last: After this life the Saints shall no more be troubled with
                                War from Devils and their Instruments. The City of Heaven, provided
                                for the Saints, is well-walled, &amp; well-Gated, &amp;
                                Well-Guarded, so that no Devils nor their Instruments shall enter
                                therein. 21. Rev. 10. &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>1. Use. It may serve to Reprove such as seem to be amazed at the War the
                        Devil has raised amongst us by Wizards, &amp; Witches against the Lamb and
                        his Followers that they altogether deny it. If ever there were Wirches, Men
                        &amp; Women in Covenant with the Devil, here are Multitudes in New-England.
                        Nor is it so strange</p>
            <span class="pb">page: 155</span>
            <p>The Devil &amp; his Instruments will be</p>
            <p>a thing there should be such: no nor that some Church
                        Members should be such. The Jews after the Returne of their captivity,
                        wofully degenerated even unto the horrible sin of Sorcerie &amp; Witchcraft.
                        3. Mal. 5. Pious Bishop Hall saith, The Devils prevalency in this Age is
                        most clear in the Marvailous number of Witches abounding in all places. Now
                        hundreds (sais he) are discovered in one Shire; &amp; if Fame deceive us
                        not, in a Village of 14. Houses in the North, are found so many of this
                        Damned brood. Heretofore only Barbarous Desarts had them, but now the
                        Civilest &amp; Religious Parts are frequently pestered with them: Heretofore
                        some silly ignorant old Woman, &amp;c. &amp; but now we have known those of
                        both Sexes, who professed much Knowledge, Holiness, &amp; Devotion, drawn
                        into this damnable practise. Baxters Apparitions &amp; Witches. pag.
                        122.<br/> Also the same Mr. Baxter speaks of a Woman who pretended to have
                        the holy Ghost, &amp; had a Gift of Prayer, &amp; did many wonders, proved
                        to be a witch. p. 123.</p>

                    <p>2. Use. We may see here who they are that War against the Lamb, &amp; his
                        Followers. Why they are Devils, or Devils instruments. Here are but 2
                        parties in the World, the Lamb &amp; his Followers, &amp; the Dragon &amp;
                        his Followers: &amp; these are contrary one to to the other. Well now they
                        that are against the Lamb, against the Peace &amp; Prosperity of Zion, the
                        interest of Christ: They are for the Devil. Here are no Newters. Every one
                        is on one side or the other.</p>
         
                    <p>3. Use. It calls us all (especially those that would be accounted Followers
                        of the Lamb) to mourn that the Devil has had so many assistants from amongst
                        us, especially that he should find, or make such in our Churches. If so be
                        Churches are deeply to mourn the dishonor done to Christ &amp; Religion, by
                        Fornicators among them. 1. Cor. 5. 1. &amp;c. how much more, when Witches
                        &amp; Wizards are amongst them.</p>
                
                    <p>4. Use. It may show us the vileness of our natures, &amp; that we should be
                        ever praying that we be not left to our own lusts: for then we shall by
                        &amp; by fall in with Devils, &amp; with the Dragon make war with the Lamb
                        &amp; his followers.</p>
            
                    <span class="pb">page: 156</span>
            <p>Waring against Christ &amp; his Followers</p>
                    <p>Conco.2a} 11. Setpr. 1692</p>

                    <p>17. Rev. 14.<br/> These shall make war with the Lamb, &amp; the Lamb shall
                        overcome them. (1 Doctr.) The Devil &amp; his Instruments will be making War
                        as long as they can, with the Lamb &amp; his Followers (1. U) No marvail
                        then that the Devil &amp; his Instruments are making this War at this day in
                        our Plantations by Witchcrafts (2. U) See here wo they are that war against
                        Christ (3. U) It calls us all to mourn that the Devil has had so many
                        Assistants from amongst us (4. U) Last: It teacheth us the vileness of mans
                        nature, that if left to himself will give help &amp; assistance to the Devil
                        against Christ. To Proceed</p>
         
                    <p>5. Use. Caution, &amp; admonition to all &amp; every one of us to beware of
                        making War with the Lamb.</p>

                        <p>1. Consider so to do, is to fight for the Devil. Tis to fight for an
                            Enemy. Tis to fight for him, who will pay you no other wages, than of
                            being your Eternal Torturer. 1. Pet. 5.8.</p>

                        <p>2. Consider it is to take the weakest side. The Lamb shall most certainly
                            overcome. Text. 19. Rev. 17 18. &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>3. Consider this will aggravate thy sin above the sin of Devils. To fight
                            against the Lamb, is to fight against thy Saviour: which the Damned
                            Devils never had an offer of. 2. Heb. 16. He took not on him the Nature
                            of Angels.</p>

               
                        <p>4. Last: It is the way to utter ruine. I say it is the way, the high-way
                            to utter ruine. It is true Christ may conquer thee when thou are hot in
                            the Battle, as he did Saul, &amp; make thee throw away thy Weapons of
                            Rebellion. But wo can tell that he will do so? This is not ordinary;
                            &amp; if thou shouldst dye a Rebel in the fight then thou art damned for
                            ever. Therefore be we cautioned agst. making war with the Lamb.</p>

                        <p>Obj. But you may say, what is it to make war wth the Lamb? And when do
                            man make war wth the Lamb?</p>

                        <p>1. An. in generall all Disobedience to Christ is a making War against
                            him. As</p>

                            <p>1. Disobedience to his Laws. You know those that do not obey the
                                Kings Laws are justly called Rebels. 1. Reg. 12. 19. So here, not to
                                do what Christ comands is to Rebell against him, &amp; to make war
                                with him. 9. Deut. 22. 23. 24. 1. Isa. 19. 20.</p>

              <span class="pb">page: 157</span>
            <p>When do men make</p>
                            <p>2. Disobedience to Christs Ordinances is Rebellion against Christ,
                                &amp; making war with him. As warring agst. Magistrates, opposing
                                them in their duties. In this sense Korah &amp; his company are
                                called Rebels. 17. Num. 10. &amp; the Mutinous &amp; murmuring
                                Israelites are called Rebels. 20. Num. 10. Hince Resisters of
                                Authority are Resisters of God, because they Resist the Ordinance of
                                God. 13. Rom. 1 &amp;c. But.</p>

                            <p>3. Answ: More especially to fight against the Lamb, &amp; so to side
                                with the Devil is.</p>

                                <p>1. To fight against the Gosple, or to war against the Gosple.
                                    When men will not receive the Gosple, &amp; do what they can to
                                    hinder the course of the Gosple, this is to make war with the
                                    Lamb.</p>

                                    <p>1. When men will not receive the Gosple themselves, then they
                                        fight agst. the Lamb: as the Jews. 13. Acts. 46. Not to
                                        accept of terms of Peace, is to proclaim war &amp;c.</p>

                                    <p>2. When they will not suffer others to receive it, as those
                                        Jews. 13. Acts. 44. &amp;c. &amp; the Sorcerer. 8. V. &amp;
                                        those 2. Tim. 3. 8. And they that forbid preaching 5. Acts.
                                        28</p>

                                <p>2. They make War against the Lamb, who oppose the holy Spirit. 7.
                                    Acts. 51. Ye do alwayes Resist ye holy Ghost.</p>

                                <p>3. Last: They make war against the Lamb, who do oppose the
                                    doctrine of Christ. As</p>

                              
                                    <p>1. Either the Person of Christ his Deity, or his Humanity. He
                                        must be man that he might dye for us: He must be God, that
                                        he might conquer Death for us. Now to deny either of these
                                        is to deny the Lamb, &amp; so to make war wth the Lamb.</p>
                            
                                    <p>2. Or the offices of Christ as a saviour both Prophetical
                                        Sacerdotal, or Regal. His office of Prophet to teach; of
                                        Priest to Attone for us; of King to Governe us; as might in
                                        particular be shown.</p>

            <p> War with the Lamb?</p>
               
                    <p>6. viz.  Last: may be of encouragement to all Christians in the words of the
                        Apostle to endure hardness, as good Souldiers of Christ. 2. Tim. 2. 3. For
                        encouragement hereto Devils and instruments shall not war against us
                        alwayes. 2. Rev. 10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer:
                        behold, the Devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried;
                        &amp; ye shall have Tribulation. 10. dayes: be thou Faithful unto Death,
                        &amp; will give thee a Crown of life.</p>
