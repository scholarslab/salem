            <p>110. Ps. I.</p>
            <p>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
            <p>Doctr. Our once humbled, wounded, &amp; bruised Mediator, has long since been exaulted,<br/>
          not only by a Glorious Resurrection from the Grave, &amp; and also a Glorious Asension into<br/>
          Heaven, but also by a Glorious Session at the Right hand ofGod. Here it was enquired (1) What<br/>
          is the Session of Christ at the Right hand of God (2) When did this Session begin, &amp; <br/>
          how long shall it continue? (3) Last: What are the Fruits of this Session? (An) The fruits <br/>
          &amp; benefitys hereof belong partly to Christs Sacerdotal Office; &amp; tp Christs Kingly Office <br/>
          (1) The great benefit which ariseth from Christs Session at the Right hand of God, as to <br/>
          his Sacerdotal Office, is his</p>

            <p> Intersession for Believers 8 Rom.34.</p>
            <p>Here these things may be enquired into</p>
            <p>1. With whom Christ dos Intercede?</p>
            <p>2. After what manner dos Christ Intercede?</p>
            <p>3. Last: Whither Christ dos Intercede?</p>
      
            <h3 align="center">1. Q. With whom Christ dos Intercede?</h3>
            <p>An: For answer hereto, we must Note, that to Intercede is to have some Plea<br/>
    put in, or preferred to another by a third Person: so that here are Three Persons<br/>
    to be considered in this Intercession</p>
            <p>1. There is the Offended Person: Abd that is God. God is angry: He is displeased, <br/>
      &amp; incensed.</p>
            <p>2. There is the Offending Person: And that is Man. yea all Mankind; the whole Race<br/>
      of Apostate Adam, as such. Even the very Elect, are by nature dead in sins &amp; <br/>
      trespasses. Offending Persons, &amp; so by nature children of wrather, God is offended with<br/>
      them. 2. Eph. 1.3. 7. Ps 11</p>
    
            <p>3. Last: There is the Intercessing Persons: And that is Christ Jesus, who steps in <br/>
      between  the justly Offended Person, God, &amp;  the unjustly Offending Person, Man, to make<br/>
      peace between them both. 1. Tim. 2. 5. There is One Mediatour between God &amp;, the man<br/>
      Christ Jesus. God being now offended cannot now speak one good word to us but by Christ: <br/>
      And we being the Offending Persons, dare not look up to God for favour, but thro Christ. <br/>
      Christ Intercedes with the Father, as being the first Person in the sacred Trinity, who being<br/>
      once appeased together with him the Son, &amp; Holy Spirit also appeased: so that his Intercession<br/>
      is directed to the whole Trinity immediately to the first Person, &amp; then in him also to the<br/> 
      rest.</p>
  
            <h3 align="center">2. Q. After what manner dos Christ Intercede wth ye Father?</h3>
            <p>1. An. Negatively: Not by any external prayers, nor by prostration of himself, or falling down upon<br/>
      his knees, aswe do, &amp; he also was want to do, whilst in ye state of his humiliation, as we read.<br/>
      26. Matt. 39. 22. Luke.41 He kneeled down &amp; prayed. Not so now</p>
    
            <p>2. An.: Affirmatively.</p>
    
            <p>3. Christ appeaers before the face of his Father &amp; presents him with the inestimable worth<br/>
      &amp; value of his sufferings. </p>
    
            <span class="pb">page: 134</span>
  
            <h3 align="center">At the Right hand of God</h3>
            <p>The worth of Souls, is above all the world.Much more valluable must be that price, by which<br/>
    such precious Souls are purchased. The Sufferings of Christ are speaking Sufferings. 12. Heb. 24.<br/>
    It is called the blood of God. 20. Acts. 28. And therefore must needs be infinitely valuable. Men<br/>
    highly vallue their own blood: How much more ill he prize his own blood? As Christs was by communication<br/>
    of Properties.</p>
  
            <p>2. Christ intercedes by his expressing his will &amp; desire to the Father. He pleads as. 17. Joh. 4.<br/>
    Father, I have Glorified three on the earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. q.d. <br/>
    Father, in order to the Salvation of a certain number of poor lost <span class="del">father</span> 
               <br/>
    Mankind, thou didst require my assuming of sinful flesh, &amp; perfect obedience both active &amp; passive<br/>
    &amp;c. Father, I have done as thou didst require. Well, &amp; what then? Why then sais he I require that<br/>
    these I have suffered for have the benefit of it. 24. v. of that. 17. John. Father, I will that they also <br/>
    whom thou hast given me be w'th where I am &amp;c. Man by the Fall was mortally wounded: By the suffering of<br/>
    Christ a Restorative Plaster was made; but now Christs Intercession is as it were an application of that Plaster.</p>

            <h3 align="center">3. Q. Last: Whither Christ does Intercede alone</h3>
            <p>An: Yea, verily; for the Scripture attests not mention of any other Intecessors. As for the Holy Angels, <br/>
    the Scripture attests no such thing of them. And as for the Saints in Heaven they have no knowledge of our <br/>
    private state 63. Isa. 16. </p>
            <span class="pb">page: 135</span>

            <h3 align="center">Of Christs Glorious Session</h3>
            <p>&amp; therefore are uncapable to Intercede for us. True it is the Saints on Earth <br/>
          ought to intercede for one [an]other, but yet improperly, For he only properly can be said to intercede <br/>
          for an other</p>
        
            <p>1. Who brings forth &amp; offers somthing of his own Sufficient worth, price, &amp; vallue, as that he, <br/>
          he petitions to, or intercede with,  should an injustice answer his request for ye sake thereof.</p>
            <p>2. All this is to be done by him that would be accounted an Inercessor in his own Name.</p>
            <p>But now is this the Prerogative only of Christ Jesus, both to Intercede in his own Name, &amp; upon<br/>
          the account of his Merit.</p>
            <p>So much for the blessed fruit of Christs sitting at the Right hand of God with respect to his Priestly <br/>
          office, namely his Intercession for all his Elect.</p>
      
            <h3 align="center">Conco. 4a</h3>
        
        
            <h3 align="center">Afternoon of the same day</h3>
            <p>(2) Another great benefit which ariseth from Christs sitting at the Right hand of the Father, belongs<br/>
            to his Kingly Office, &amp; consists of two things.</p>
            <p>1. In his Government of his Church</p>
            <p>2. In his defending ofit against its enemies.</p>
            <p>I. Then Christ sits at the Right hand of God the Father, as Lord &amp; King to Govern his Church.<br/>
            Indeed he has the Rule &amp; Government of the of the whole world. 28. Matt. 18. All Power is given<br/>
            unto me in Heaven &amp; in Earth. But his special Government is exercised towards his Church. As Joseph<br/>
            when exalted from a Prison, he had the Rule of all Egypt but he took special care of his Brethern. So here.<br/>
            Now Christ governs his Church by External means, &amp; by Internal means.</p>
            <p>1. By External means, namely by his Word &amp; Rod. By the preaching of the word, whereby he gives us<br/>
            his Laws: &amp; by afflictions whereby he brings us</p>
            <span class="pb">page: 136</span>
        
        
        
            <h3 align="center">At the Right hand of God</h3>
            <p>back, when we have strayed from them. 119. Ps. 67.</p>
            <p>More, particularly the order of this Government is after this manner</p>
            <p>By the praching of the word, Christ gathers a Church by separating of the Elect from the rest of Mankind<br/>
            as his peculiar Flock. 15. Joh. 19. I have chosen you out of the world. i.e. I have separated you from the world:<br/>
            Now by what means is this separation made?Why it is by the Preaching of the word, that a Church os born &amp;<br/>
            propogated. This is the way men are born again. 3. joh. 3  2. Acts. 41.47  4. Ch. 4  &amp; 6. 7. And for this<br/>
            purpose Christ hath given Ministers extraordinary &amp; ordinary, fitted &amp; qualified for this work.<br/>
            4. Eph. 8. 4. 12. 13. By adding to the Preaching of the word the efficacy of his spirit, by which means the dark<br/>
            minds of the Elect are enlightened, &amp; their hard hearts are softened. It is said of the Apostles that they<br/>
            went forth preaching of the word, &amp; the Lord worked with them. ult. Mark. ult. i.e. both with Preachers, <br/>
            &amp; Hearers. An instance you have in Lydia. 16. Acts. 14. Hince all saving profit by the word is justly<br/>
            attributed unto God. 1. Cor. 3. 5. 6. 7. We our selves,  as the Children of Isreal of old, are abundantly<br/>
            prone to wander in the wilderness of this world, were it not for Christ as a pillar of fire, &amp; a cloud,<br/>
            by his word &amp; spirit, giving before us, as our Leader into the Heavenly Canaan. 30. Isa. 20. 21. --- Thine<br/>
            ears shall hear a word behind three saying this is the way &amp;cc.</p>
            <p>3. Last: By exercising his Church in Spiritual obedience by manifold &amp; various troubles, afflictions,<br/>
            &amp; persecutions in this world, even as Earthly good Princes chasten the transgressors of their laws<br/>
            to bring them to obsdience: Christ hath placed his Church in this world, as in a Sea, &amp; suffereth</p>
            <span class="pb">page: 137</span>
        
        
        
            <h3 align="center">Of Christs Glorious Session</h3>
          
            <p>many storms&amp; tempests to hreaten its Shipwreck, whilst in the mean time he himself seems to be<br/>
            fast asleep., as 8. Matt. 23. 24. Now this Christ doth chiefly for these three Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. R. To humble this Church of their sins. The Church of God whilst militant is not without sin: <br/>
            well now by sore afflictions, &amp; cross providences. Christ will bring her sins to remembrance of them.<br/>
            5. Lam. 16. The crown has fallen from our head: wo unto us that we have sinned. They mourn more for their<br/>
            sin, than for the loss of their crown.</p>
            <p>2. R. To make his Church more watchful against sins even as Parents, seeing their young children Over<br/>
            bold with Fire, orwater, they bring their children neaer to the fire, &amp; hold them over ye water<br/>
            , as if they would burn them, or drown them whereas they intend nothing less, only to awe them &amp;<br/>
            fright them, that they may hereafter keep father off: Why so our Lord Jesus seeing us often over bold<br/>
            &amp; venturesome upon sin, &amp; for a time seems to desert, &amp; all is out of love to prevent a<br/>
            total fall, as in David &amp; Peter.</p>
            <p>3. R. Last:To make us more watchfull to duty. Hince afflictions are compared to a hedge of thorns.<br/>
            2. Hos. 6. Now unruly creatures when they endeavour to break the bounds but meet with pricking briers<br/>
            &amp; thorns, this will cause them to decist: So hereEven famour Paul had need of such a smarting<br/>
            Providence to keep within the divine bounds of humility. 2. Cor. 12. 7.</p>
            <p>II.As Christ Governs his Church, as he sits as King, sitting at tje Right hand of the Father,<br/>
            so also He as King defends his Church against all ruining attemps and purposes. Now here a twofold<br/>
            action as of Christ</p>
            <span class="pb">page: 138</span>
        
        
        
            <h3 align="center">At the Right hand God</h3>
          
            <p>as King Falls under our considertaion. Namely</p>
            <p>1. The deportment of Christ, as King, sitting at the Right hand of the Father, with reference<br/>
            to the defense of his Church</p>
            <p>2. depoartment of Christ, as King, sitting at the Right hand of ye Father, with reference to the<br/>
            punishing of the Enimies of his Church.</p>
            <p>I. Then Christ, as King, at the Right hand of the Father for the defense of his Church, against<br/>
            all the madness, rage, &amp; fury, of their enimies. The Church is separated from the world:<br/>
            They are new-born, new creatures, have other aims, end, &amp; principles, different from, yea <br/>
            contrary to the men of the world: Hince ariset hatred &amp; persecution from those they act contrary<br/>
            to. As long as there is contrary Seed, a Seed of the Woman, &amp; a Seed of the Serpent, there will<br/>
            be opposition, more or less, open or secret. 4. Gal. 27. Hince it is that not seldom great hatred ariseth<br/>
            from the nearest Relations. 13 Mark. 12. 13. Well, but then, you may say, what will become of the Church,<br/>
            for that is but a small part of the world. 12. Luke. 32. Oh, as little part as they are, they are well enough,<br/>
            secure enough. Their King Christ takes special care of them. 27. Isa. 3. Lest any hurt it, I will keep it<br/>
            night &amp; day. Now Christ defends his Church two ways</p>
            <p>1. By supplying the, with renewed strength suitable to their trials. Christ having begun a new work,<br/>
            it is the main drift of the Devil to pull it all down, but Christ will see the promoting of it.<br/>
            1. Philip. 6. He yt hath begun good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.<br/>
            He gives renewed strength. 1. Cor. 11. As in those worthies. 11. Heb. p totum</p>
            <p>By hampering &amp; fettering their enemies &amp;c. As we see in the case of the Jews in Esthers days</p>
            <p> Christ defends his Church against three great enemies</p>
            <p>1. Against inward enemies in their own souls: their own remaining lusts. 7. Rom. 24.25.</p>
            <p>2. Against furious &amp; fiery persecutions. Hince the Church is comparedto a burning bush. 3. Ex. 2.<br/>
            And. 12. Rev. 14 ad finem</p>
            <p>Last: Against the power of Death. 1. Cor. 15. 25. 26. 5. John. 28. 29.</p>
            <p>2. Christ as King site at the Right hand of the Father for the punishment of the enemies of his Church.<br/>
            Both these are the properties of a God King &amp;c</p>
            <span class="pb">page: 139</span>
        
        
        
            <h3 align="center">Of Christs Glorious Session</h3>
            <p>1. The Devil the grand enemy of the Church, Christ afflicts him by hindering the success: as in Peters case.<br/>
            22. Luke. 31. 32. He ninds his strong man armed &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. Wicked &amp; Rebrobate men (the assistants of Satan to afflict the Church) he punisheth them by <br/>
            hardening of their proud &amp; inveterate hearts, as we see in Pharoah, so yt they run themselves<br/>
            voluntarily &amp; merrily into ye Sea of destruction.  Sometimes they fall into utter desperation<br/>
            as bloody Saul, &amp; treacherous Ahitophel &amp; Judas &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But by reason of the Cold so much shall suffice for the doctrinal handling of this point.
          hearts. i.e. with reference to the punishing of the Enemies of the Church. </p>
