					<p>WE left Mr. Parris in the early part of November, 1691, at the crisis of his
						controversy with the inhabitants of Salem Village, under circumstances which
						seemed to indicate that its termination was near at hand. The opposition to
						him had assumed a form which made it quite probable that it would succeed in
						dislodging him from his position. But the end was not yet. Events were
						ripening that were to give him a new and fearful strength, and open a scene
						in which he was to act a part destined to attract the notice of the world,
						and become a permanent portion of human history. The doctrines of demonology
						had produced their full effect upon the minds of men, and every thing was
						ready for a final display of their power. The story of the Goodwin children,
						as told by Cotton Mather; was known and read in all the dwellings of the
						land, and filled the imaginations of a credulous age. Deputy Danforth had
						begun the work of arrests; and <pb n="002" id="vII002"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2005">
							<figDesc>Page 002.</figDesc>
						</figure> persons charged with witchcraft, belonging to neighboring towns,
						were already in prison.</p>
					<p>Mr. Parris appears to have had in his family several slaves, probably brought
						by him from the West Indies. One of them, whom he calls, in his
						church-record book, “my negro lad,” had died, a year or two before, at the
						age of nineteen. Two of them were man and wife. The former was always known
						by the name of “John Indian;” the latter was called “Tituba.” These two
						persons may have originated the “Salem witchcraft.” They are spoken of as
						having come from New Spain, as it was then called, — that is, the Spanish
						West Indies, and the adjacent mainlands of Central and South America, — and,
						in all probability, contributed, from the wild and strange superstitions
						prevalent among their native tribes, materials which, added to the commonly
						received notions on such subjects, heightened the infatuation of the times,
						and inflamed still more the imaginations of the credulous. Persons
						conversant with the Indians of Mexico, and on both sides of the Isthmus,
						discern many similarities in their systems of demonology with ideas and
						practices developed here.</p>
					<p>Mr. Parris's former residence in the neighborhood of the Spanish Main, and
						the prominent part taken by his Indian slaves in originating the proceedings
						at the village, may account for some of the features of the transaction.</p>
					<p>During the winter of 1691 and 1692, a circle of young girls had been formed,
						who were in the habit of meeting at Mr. Parris's house for the purpose of
							<pb n="003" id="vII003"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2006">
							<figDesc>Page 003.</figDesc>
						</figure> practising palmistry, and other arts of fortune-telling, and of
						becoming experts in the wonders of necromancy, magic, and spiritualism. It
						consisted, besides the Indian servants, mainly of the following persons:
						—</p>
					<p>Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. Parris, was nine years of age. She seems to have
						performed a leading part in the first stages of the affair, and must have
						been a child of remarkable precocity. It is a noticeable fact, that her
						father early removed her from the scene. She was sent to the town, where she
						remained in the family of Stephen Sewall, until the proceedings at the
						village were brought to a close. Abigail Williams, a niece of Mr. Parris,
						and a member of his household, was eleven years of age. She acted
						conspicuously in the witchcraft prosecutions from beginning to end. Ann
						Putnam, daughter of Sergeant Thomas Putnam, the parish clerk or recorder,
						was twelve years of age. The character and social position of her parents
						gave her a prominence which an extraordinary development of the imaginative
						faculty, and of mental powers generally, enabled her to hold throughout.
						This young girl is perhaps entitled to be regarded as, in many respects, the
						leading agent in all the mischief that followed. Mary Walcot was seventeen
						years of age. Her father was Jonathan Walcot (vol. i. p. 225). His first
						wife, Mary Sibley, to whom he was married in 1664, had died in 1683. She was
						the mother of Mary. It is a singular fact, and indicates the estimation in
						which Captain Walcot was held, that, although not a church, he filled the
						office of deacon of the parish <pb n="004" id="vII004"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2007">
							<figDesc>Page 004.</figDesc>
						</figure> for several years before the formation of the church. Mercy Lewis
						was also seventeen years of age. When quite young, she was, for a time, in
						the family of the Rev. George Burroughs: and, in 1692, was living as a
						servant in the family of Thomas Putnam; although, occasionally, she seems to
						have lived, in the same capacity, with that of John Putnam, Jr., the
						constable of the village. He was a son of Nathaniel, and resided in the
						neighborhood of Thomas and Deacon Edward Putnam. Mercy Lewis performed a
						leading part in the proceedings, had great energy of purpose and capacity of
						management, and became responsible for much of the crime and horror
						connected with them. Elizabeth Hubbard, seventeen years of age, who also
						occupies a bad eminence in the scene, was a niece of Mrs. Dr. Griggs, and
						lived in her family. Elizabeth Booth and Susannah Sheldon, each eighteen
						years of age, belonged to families in the neighborhood. Mary Warren, twenty
						years of age, was a servant in the family of John Procter; and Sarah
						Churchill, of the same age, was a servant in that of George Jacobs, Sr.
						These two last were actuated, it is too apparent, by malicious feelings
						towards the families in which they resided, and contributed largely to the
						horrible tragedy. The facts to be exhibited will enable every one who
						carefully considers them, to form an estimate, for himself, of the
						respective character and conduct of these young persons. It is almost beyond
						belief that they were wholly actuated by deliberate and cold-blooded
						malignity. Their crime would, in that view, have been <pb n="005"
							id="vII005"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2008">
							<figDesc>Page 005.</figDesc>
						</figure> without a parallel in monstrosity of wickedness, and beyond what
						can be imagined of the guiltiest and most depraved natures. For myself, I am
						unable to determine how much may be attributed to credulity, hallucination,
						and the delirium of excitement, or to deliberate malice and falsehood. There
						is too much evidence of guile and conspiracy to attribute all their actions
						and declarations to delusion; and their conduct throughout was stamped with
						a bold assurance and audacious bearing. With one or two slight and momentary
						exceptions, there was a total absence of compunction or commiseration, and a
						reckless disregard of the agonies and destruction they were scattering
						around them. They present a subject that justly claims, and will for ever
						task, the examination of those who are most competent to fathom the
						mysteries of the human soul, sound its depths, and measure the extent to
						which it is liable to become wicked and devilish. It will be seen that other
						persons were drawn to act with these “afflicted children,” as they were
						called, some from contagious delusion, and some, as was quite well proved,
						from a false, mischievous; and malignant spirit.</p>
					<p>Besides the above-mentioned persons, there were three married women, rather
						under middle life, who acted with the afflicted children, — Mrs. Ann Putnam,
						the mother of the child of that name; Mrs. Pope; and a woman, named Bibber,
						who appears to have lived at Wenham. Another married woman, — spoken of as
						“ancient,” — named Goodell, had also been in the <pb n="006" id="vII006"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2009">
							<figDesc>Page 006.</figDesc>
						</figure> habit of attending their meetings; but she is not named in any of
						the documents on file, and was probably withdrawn, at an early period, from
						participating in the transaction.</p>
					<p>In the course of the winter, they became quite skilful and expert in the arts
						they were learning, and gradually began to display their attainments to the
						admiration and amazement of beholders. At first, they made no charges
						against any person, but confined themselves to strange actions,
						exclamations, and contortions. They would creep into holes, and under
						benches and chairs, put themselves into odd and unnatural postures, make
						wild and antic gestures, and utter incoherent and unintelligible sounds.
						They would be seized with spasms, drop insensible to the floor, or writhe in
						agony, suffering dreadful tortures, and uttering loud and piercing outcries.
						The attention of the families in which they held their meetings was called
						to their extraordinary condition and proceedings; and the whole neighborhood
						and surrounding country soon were filled with the story of the strange and
						unaccountable sufferings of the “afflicted girls.” No explanation could be
						given, and their condition became worse and worse. The physician of the
						village, Dr. Griggs, was called in, a consultation had, and the opinion
						finally and gravely given, that the afflicted children were bewitched. It
						was quite common in those days for the faculty to dispose of difficult cases
						by this resort. When their remedies were baffled, and their skill at fault,
						the patient was <pb n="007" id="vII007"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2010">
							<figDesc>Page 007.</figDesc>
						</figure> said to be “under an evil hand.” In all cases, the sage conclusion
						was received by nurses, and elderly women called in on such occasions, if
						the symptoms were out of the common course, or did not yield to the
						prescriptions these persons were in the habit of applying. Very soon, the
						whole community became excited and alarmed to the highest degree. All other
						topics were forgotten. The only thing spoken or thought of was the terrible
						condition of the afflicted children in Mr. Parris's house, or wherever, from
						time to time, the girls assembled. They were the objects of universal
						compassion and wonder. The people flocked from all quarters to witness their
						sufferings, and gaze with awe upon their convulsions. Becoming objects of
						such notice, they were stimulated to vary and expand the manifestations of
						the extraordinary influence that was upon them. They extended their
						operations beyond the houses of Mr. Parris, and the families to which they
						belonged, to public places; and their fits, exclamations, and outcries
						disturbed the exercises of prayer meetings, and the ordinary services of the
						congregation. On one occasion, on the Lord's Day, March 20th, when the
						singing of the psalm previous to the sermon was concluded, before the person
						preaching — Mr. Lawson — could come forward, Abigail Williams cried out,
						“Now stand up, and name your text.” When he had read it, in a loud and
						insolent voice she exclaimed, “It's a long text.” In the midst of the
						discourse, Mrs. Pope broke in, “Now, there is enough of that.” In the
						afternoon of the same day, while referring <pb n="008" id="vII008"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2011">
							<figDesc>Page 008.</figDesc>
						</figure> to the doctrine he had been expounding in the preceding service,
						Abigail Williams rudely ejaculated, “I know no doctrine you had. If you did
						name one, I have forgot it.” An aged member of the church was present,
						against whom a warrant on the charge of witchcraft had been procured the day
						before. Being apprised of the proceeding, Abigail Williams spoke aloud,
						during the service, calling by name the person about to be apprehended,
						“Look where she sits upon the beam, sucking her yellow-bird betwixt her
						fingers.” Ann Putnam, joining in, exclaimed, “There is a yellow-bird sitting
						on the minister's hat, as it hangs on the pin in the pulpit.” Mr. Lawson
						remarks, with much simplicity, that these things, occurring “in the time of
						public worship, did something interrupt me in my first prayer, being so
						unusual.” But he braced himself up to the emergency, and went on with the
						service. There is no intimation that Mr. Parris rebuked his niece for her
						disorderly behavior. As at several other times, the people sitting near Ann
						Putnam had to lay hold of her to prevent her proceeding to greater
						extremities, and wholly breaking up the meeting. The girls were supposed to
						be under an irresistible and supernatural impulse; and, instead of being
						severely punished, were looked upon with mingled pity, terror, and awe, and
						made objects of the greatest attention. Of course, where members of the
						minister's family were countenanced in such proceedings, during the
						exercises of public worship, on the Lord's Day, in the meeting-house, it was
						not <pb n="009" id="vII009"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2012">
							<figDesc>Page 009.</figDesc>
						</figure> strange that people in general yielded to the excitement. But all
						did not. Several members of the family of Francis Nurse, Peter Cloyse and
						wife, and Joseph Putnam, expressed their disapprobation of such doings being
						allowed, and absented themselves from meeting. Perhaps others took the same
						course; but whoever did were marked, as the sequel will show.</p>
					<p>In the mean while the excitement was worked up to the highest pitch. The
						families to which several of the “afflicted children” belonged were led to
						apply themselves to fasting and prayer, on which occasions the neighbors,
						under the guidance of the minister, would assemble, and unite in invocations
						to the Divine Being to interpose and deliver them from the snares and
						dominion of Satan. The “afflicted children” who might be present would not,
						as a general thing, interrupt the prayers while in progress, but would break
						out with their wild outcries and convulsive spasms in the intervals of the
						service. In due time, Mr. Parris sent for the neighboring ministers to
						assemble at his house, and unite with him in devoting a day to solemn
						religious services and earnest supplications to the throne of Mercy for
						rescue from the power of the great enemy of souls. The ministers spent the
						day in Mr. Parris's house, and the children performed their feats before
						their eyes. The reverend gentlemen were astounded at what they saw, fully
						corroborated the opinion of Dr. Griggs, and formally declared their belief
						that the Evil One had commenced his operations with a bolder front and <pb
							n="010" id="vII010"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2013">
							<figDesc>Page 010.</figDesc>
						</figure> on a broader scale than ever before in this or any other
						country.</p>
					<p>This judgment of the ministers was quickly made known everywhere; and, if
						doubt remained in any mind, it was suppressed by the irresistible power of
						an overwhelming public conviction. Individuals were lost in the universal
						fanaticism. Society was dissolved into a wild and excited crowd. Men and
						women left their fields, their houses, their labors and employments, to
						witness the awful unveiling of the demoniac power, and to behold the
						workings of Satan himself upon the victims of his wrath.</p>
					<p>It must be borne in mind, that it was then an established doctrine in
						theology, philosophy, and law, that the Devil could not operate upon
						mortals, or mortal affairs, except through the intermediate instrumentality
						of human beings in confederacy with him, that is, witches or wizards. The
						question, of course, in all minds and on all tongues, was, “Who are the
						agents of the Devil in afflicting these girls? There must be some among us
						thus acting, and who are they?” For some time the girls held back from
						mentioning names; or, if they did, it was prevented from being divulged to
						the public. In the mean time, the excitement spread and deepened. At length
						the people had become so thoroughly prepared for the work, that it was
						concluded to begin operations in earnest. The continued pressure upon the
						“afflicted children,” the earnest and importunate inquiry, on all sides,
						“Who is it that bewitches you?” opened their lips in response, and <pb
							n="011" id="vII011"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2014">
							<figDesc>Page 011.</figDesc>
						</figure> they began to select and bring forward their victims. One after
						another, they cried out “Good,” “Osburn,” “Tituba.” On the 29th of February,
						1692, warrants were duly issued against those persons. It is observable,
						that the complainants who procured the warrants in these cases were Joseph
						Hutchinson, Edward Putnam, Thomas Putnam, and Thomas Preston. This fact
						shows how nearly unanimous, at this time, was the conviction that the
						sufferings of the girls were the result of witchcraft. Joseph Hutchinson was
						a firm man, of strong common sense, and from his general character and ways
						of thinking and acting, one of the last persons liable to be carried away by
						a popular enthusiasm, and was found among the earliest rescued from it.
						Thomas Preston was a son-in-law of Francis Nurse.</p>
					<p>As all was ripe for the development of the plot, extraordinary means were
						taken to give publicity, notoriety, and effect to the first examinations. On
						the 1st of March the two leading magistrates of the neighborhood, men of
						great note and influence, whose fathers had been among the chief founders of
						the settlement, and who were Assistants, — that is, members of the highest
						legislative and judicial body in the colony, combining with the functions of
						a senate those of a court of last resort with most comprehensive
						jurisdiction, — John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, entered the village, in
						imposing array, escorted by the marshal, constables, and their aids, with
						all the trappings of their offices; reined up at Nathaniel Ingersoll <pb
							n="012" id="vII012"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2015">
							<figDesc>Page 012.</figDesc>
						</figure> corner, and dismounted at his door. The whole population of the
						neighborhood, apprised of the occasion, was gathered on the lawn, or came
						flocking along the roads. The crowd was so great that it was necessary to
						adjourn to the meeting-house, which was filled at once by a multitude
						excited to the highest pitch of indignation and abhorrence towards the
						prisoners, and of curiosity to witness the novel and imposing spectacle and
						proceedings. The magistrates took seats in front of the pulpit, facing the
						assembly; a long table or raised platform being placed before them; and it
						was announced, that they were ready to enter upon the examination. On
						bringing in and delivering over the accused parties, the officers who had
						executed the warrants stated that they “had made diligent search for images
						and such like, but could find none.” After prayer, Constable George Locker
						produced the body of Sarah Good; and Constable Joseph Herrick, the bodies of
						Sarah Osburn, and Tituba Mr. Parris's Indian woman. The evidence seems to
						indicate, that, on these occasions, the prisoners were placed on the
						platform, to keep them from the contact of the general crowd, and that all
						might see them.</p>
					<p>Sarah Good was first examined, the other two being removed from the house for
						the time. In complaining of her, and bringing her forward first, the
						prosecutors showed that they were well advised. There was a general
						readiness to receive the charge against her, as she was evidently the object
						of much prejudice in the neighborhood. Her husband, who was a weak, <pb
							n="013" id="vII013"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2016">
							<figDesc>Page 013.</figDesc>
						</figure> ignorant, and dependent person, had become alienated from her. The
						family were very poor; and she and her children had sometimes been without a
						house to shelter them, and left to wander from door to door for relief.
						Whether justly or not, she appears to have been subject to general obloquy.
						Probably there was no one in the country around, against whom popular
						suspicion could have been more readily directed, or in whose favor and
						defence less interest could be awakened. She was a forlorn, friendless, and
						forsaken creature, broken down by wretchedness of condition and ill-repute.
						The following are the minutes of her examination, as found among the files:

						<p>“Who do you employ then? — I employ nobody. I scorn it.</p>

					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Salem Village, March the 1st, 1692. — Sarah Good, upon examination,

						<p>“The abovenamed children, being all present, positively accused her of

					</q>
					<p>It will be noticed that the examination was conducted in the form of
						questions put by the magistrate, Hathorne, based upon a foregone conclusion
						of the prisoner's guilt, and expressive of a conviction, all along on his
						part, that the evidence of “the afflicted” against her amounted to, and was,
						absolute demonstration. It will also be noticed, that, severe as was the
						opinion of her husband in reference to her general conduct, he could not be
						made to say that he had ever noticed any thing in her of the nature of
						witchcraft. The torments the girls affected to experience in looking at her
						must have produced an overwhelming effect on the crowd, as they did on the
						magistrate, and even on the poor, amazed creature herself. She did not seem
						to doubt the reality of their sufferings. In this, and in all cases, it must
						be remembered that the account of the examination comes to us from those who
						were under the wildest excitement against the prisoners; that no counsel was
						allowed them; that, if any thing was suffered to be said in their defence by
						others, it has failed to reach us; that the accused persons were wholly
						unaccustomed to such scenes and exposures, unsuspicious of the perils of a
						cross-examination, or of an inquisition conducted with a design to entrap
						and ensnare; and that what they did say was liable to be misunderstood, as
						well as misrepresented. We cannot hear their story. All we know is from
						parties <pb n="017" id="vII017"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2020">
							<figDesc>Page 017.</figDesc>
						</figure> prejudiced, to the highest degree, against them. Sarah Good was an
						unfortunate and miserable woman in her circumstances and condition: but,
						from all that appears on the record, making due allowance for the credulity,
						extravagance, prejudice, folly, or malignity of the witnesses; giving full
						effect to every thing that can claim the character of substantial force
						alleged against her, it is undeniable, that there was not, beyond the
						afflicted girls, a particle of evidence to sustain the charge on which she
						was arraigned; and that, in the worst aspect of her case, she was an object
						for compassion, rather than punishment. Altogether, the proceedings against
						her, which terminated with her execution, were cruel and shameful to the
						highest degree.</p>
					<p>On the conclusion of her examination, she was removed from the meeting-house,
						and Sarah Osburn brought in. Her selection, as one of the persons to be
						first cried out upon, was judicious. The public mind was prepared to believe
						the charge against her. Her original name was Sarah Warren. She was married,
						April 5, 1662, to Robert Prince, who belonged to a leading family, and owned
						a valuable farm. He died early, leaving her with two young children, James
						and Joseph.</p>
					<p>In the early colonial period, it was the custom for persons who desired to
						come from the old country to America, but had not the means to defray the
						expenses of the passage, to let or sell themselves, for a greater or less
						length of time, to individuals residing here who needed their service. The
						practice continued <pb n="018" id="vII018"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2021">
							<figDesc>Page 018.</figDesc>
						</figure> down to the present century. Emigrants who thus sold themselves
						for a period of years were called “redemptioners.” Alexander Osburn came
						over from Ireland in this character. The widow of Robert Prince bought out
						the residue of his time from the person to whom he was thus under contract,
						for fifteen pounds, and employed him to carry on her farm. After a while,
						she married him. This, it is probable, gave rise to some criticism; and, as
						her boys grew up, became more and more disagreeable to them. The marriage,
						as was natural, led to unhappy results. In 1720, after Osburn had been dead
						some years, a curious case was brought into court, in which the sons of
						Robert Prince testified that Osburn treated their mother and them with great
						cruelty and barbarity. They had become of age before their mother's death,
						and had signed their names to a deed conveying away land belonging to their
						patrimony. The object of the suit was to invalidate the conveyance by
						proving that they were compelled by Osburn to sign the deed, he using
						threats and violence upon them at the time. There was an extraordinary
						conflict of testimony in the trial; some witnesses strongly corroborating
						the accusations of the Princes, and some equally strong in vindication of
						the character of Osburn. It was shown, that, in the opinion of several of
						his neighbors, he was an industrious, respectable, and worthy person. It is
						difficult to determine the precise merits of the case. After the death of
						his wife, Osburn married Ruth, a daughter of William Cantlebury, and widow
						of William Sibley. <pb n="019" id="vII019"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2022">
							<figDesc>Page 019.</figDesc>
						</figure> She was a woman of unquestioned excellence of character, and of a
						large landed estate. Osburn was her third husband, the first having been
						Thomas Small. After her marriage to Osburn, he and she joined the church,
						and were reputable persons in all respects. He was well regarded as a
						citizen, and often on the parish committee. Neither he nor the widow Sibley
						appear to have been implicated in the witchcraft proceedings in any other
						particular than that he testified that his then wife Sarah had not been for
						some time at meeting. There is no indication that this was volunteer
						testimony. He and his wife Ruth were among the firmest opponents of Mr.
						Parris. There is no mention of his having had children by either of his
						American wives. His son John, who probably came with him to the country, was
						an inhabitant of the Village; and his name is on the rate-list, for the last
						time, in 1718, his father having died some years before. The Osborne family,
						in this part of the country, does not appear to have sprung from this
						source.</p>
					<p>Without attempting to decide where, or in what proportions, the blame is to
						be laid, the fact is evident, that the marriage of the widow Sarah Prince to
						Alexander Osburn was an unhappy one. Her mind became depressed, if not
						distracted. For some time, she had been bedridden. Of course, as she had
						occupied a respectable social position, and was a woman of property, her
						case naturally gave rise to scandal. Rumor was busy and gossip rife in
						reference to her; and it was quite natural that she should have been
						suggested <pb n="020" id="vII020"/>

						</figure> for the accusing girls to pitch upon. The following is an account
						of her examination by the magistrates, in the handwriting of John Hathorne:
						—</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Sarah Osburne, upon examination, denied the matter of fact, viz., that
							she ever understood or used any witchcraft, or hurt any of the abovesaid
							children.</p>
						<p>“The children above named, being all personally present, accused her face
							to face; which, being done, they were all hurt, afflicted, and tortured
							very much; which, being over, and they out of their fits, they said that
							said Sarah Osburne did then come to them, and hurt them, Sarah Osburne
							being then kept at a distance personally from them. Sarah Osburne was
							asked why she then hurt them. She denied it. It being asked of her how
							she could so pinch and hurt them, and yet she be at that distance
							personally from them, she answered she did not then hurt them, nor ever
							did. She was asked who, then, did it, or who she employed to do it. She
							answered she did not know that the Devil goes about in her likeness to
							do any hurt. Sarah Osburne, being told that Sarah Good, one of her
							companions, had, upon examination, accused her, she, notwithstanding,
							denied the same, according to her examination, which is more at large
							given in, as therein will appear.”</p>

						<p>“What familiarity have you with Sarah Good? — None: I have not seen her
							these two years.</p>
						<p>“Where did you see her then? — One day, agoing to town.</p>
						<p>“What communications had you with her? — I had none, only `How do you
							do?' or so. I do not know her by name.</p>
						<p>“What did you call her, then?</p>

						<p>“Sarah Good saith that it was you that hurt the children. — I do not know

						<p>“Mr. Hathorne desired all the children to stand up, and look upon her,

							evidences declared that she said this morning, that she was more like to
							be bewitched than that she was a witch. Mr. Hathorne asked her what made

							and either saw, or dreamed that she saw, a thing like an Indian all
							black, which did pinch her in her neck, and pulled her by the back part
							of her head to the door of the house.</p>
						<p>“Did you never see any thing else? — No.</p>

						<p>“Were you never tempted further? — No.</p>
						<p>“Why did you yield thus far to the Devil as never to go to meeting since?

						<p>“Her husband and others said that she had not been at meeting three years

					</q>
					<p>The foregoing illustrates the unfairness practised by the examining
						magistrate. He took for granted, as we shall find to have been the case in
						all instances, the guilt of the prisoner, and endeavored to entangle her by
						leading questions, thus involving her in contradiction. By the force of his
						own assumptions, he had compelled Sarah Good to admit the reality of the
						sufferings of the girls, and that they must be caused by some one. The
						amount of what she had said was, that, if caused by one or the other of
						them, “then it must be Osburn,” for she was sure of her own innocence. This
						expression, to which she was driven in self-exculpation, was perverted by
						the reporter, Ezekiel Cheever, and by the magistrate, into an indirect
						confession and a direct accusation of Osburn. In the absence of Good, the
						magistrate told Osburn that Good had confessed and accused her. This was a
						misrepresentation of one, and a false and fraudulent trick upon the other.
						Considering the feeble condition of Sarah Osburn generally, the snares by
						which she <pb n="023" id="vII023"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2026">

						she was placed, and the infirm state of her reason, as evidenced in her
						statement of what she saw, or dreamed that she saw and heard, — not having a
						clear idea which, — her answers, as reported by the prosecutors, show that
						her broken and disordered mind was essentially truthful and innocent.</p>
					<p>Sarah Osburn was removed from the meeting-house, and Tituba brought in and
						examined, as follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Tituba, what evil spirit have you familiarity with? — None.</p>

					<p>Another report of Tituba's examination has been preserved, and may be found
						in the second volume of the collection edited by Samuel G. Drake, entitled
						the “Witchcraft Delusion in New England.” It is in the handwriting of
						Jonathan Corwin, very full and minute, and shows that the Indian woman was
						familiar with all the ridiculous and monstrous fancies then prevalent. The
						details of her statement cover nearly the whole ground of them. While
						indicating, in most respects, a mind at the lowest level of general
						intelligence, they give evidence of cunning and wariness in the highest
						degree. This document is also valuable, as it affords information about
						particulars, incidentally mentioned and thus rescued from oblivion, which
							<pb n="027" id="vII027"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2030">
							<figDesc>Page 027.</figDesc>
						</figure> serve to bring back the life of the past. Tituba describes the
						dresses of some of the witches: “A black silk hood, with a white silk hood
						under it, with topknots.” One of them wore “a serge coat, with a white cap.”
						The Devil appeared “in black clothes sometimes, sometimes serge coat of
						other color.” She speaks of the “lean-to chamber” in the parsonage, and
						describes an aërial night ride “up” to Thomas Putnam. “How did you go? What
						did you ride upon?” asked the wondering magistrate. “I ride upon a stick, or
						pole, and Good and Osburn behind me: we ride taking hold of one another;
						don't know how we go, for I saw no trees nor path, but was presently there
						when we were up.” In both reports, Tituba describes, quite graphically, the
						likenesses in which the Devil appeared to his confederates; but Corwin gives
						the details more fully than Cheever. What the latter reports of the
						appearances in which the Devil accompanied Osburn, the former amplifies.
						“The thing with two legs and wings, and a face like a woman,” “turns” into a
						full woman. The “hairy thing” becomes “a thing all over hairy, all the face
						hairy, and a long nose, and I don't know how to tell how the face looks; is
						about two or three feet high, and goeth upright like a man; and, last night,
						it stood before the fire in Mr. Parris's hall.”</p>
					<p>It is quite evident that the part played by the Indian woman on this occasion
						was pre-arranged. She had, from the first, been concerned with the circle of
						girls in their necromantic operations; and her statements <pb n="028"
							id="vII028"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2031">
							<figDesc>Page 028.</figDesc>
						</figure> show the materials out of which their ridiculous and monstrous
						stories were constructed. She said that there were four who “hurt the
						children.” Upon being pressed by the magistrate to tell who they were, she
						named Osburn and Good, but did “not know who the others were.” Two others
						were marked; but it was not thought best to bring them out until these three
						examinations had first been made to tell upon the public mind. Tituba had
						been apprised of Elizabeth Hubbard's story, that she had been “pinched” that
						morning; and, as well as “Lieutenant Fuller and others,” had heard of the
						delirious exclamation of Thomas Putnam's sick child during the night.
						“Abigail Williams, that lives with her uncle Parris,” had communicated to
						the Indian slave the story of “the woman with two legs and wings.” In fact,
						she had been fully admitted to their councils, and made acquainted with all
						the stories they were to tell. But, when it became necessary to avoid
						specifications touching parties whose names it had been decided not to
						divulge at that stage of the business, the wily old servant escapes further
						interrogation, “I am blind now: I cannot see.”</p>
					<p>Proceedings connected with these examinations were continued several days.
						The result appears, in the handwriting of John Hathorne, as follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Salem Village, March 1, 169½. — Tituba, an Indian woman, brought before
							us by Constable Jos. Herrick, of Salem, upon suspicion of witchcraft by
							her committed, according to the complaint of Jos. Hutchinson and Thomas

						<p>“Salem Village, March the 1st, 169½. — Sarah Good, Sarah Osburn, and

							of them committed; Tituba, an Indian woman, acknowledging the matter of
							fact, and Sarah Osburn and Sarah Good denying the same before us; but
							there appearing, in all their examinations, sufficient ground to secure
							them all. And, in order to further examination, they were all <hi
								rend="italics">per mittimus</hi> sent to the jails in the county of
							Essex.</p>
						<p>“Salem, March 2. — Sarah Osburn again examined, and also Tituba, as will

							fact, and also accused the other two.</p>

							examination now given in. Tituba again said the same.</p>
						<p>“Salem, March 5. — Sarah Good and Tituba again examined; and, in their

						</p>
						<p>“Salem, March the 7th, 169½. — Sarah Good, Sarah Osburn, and Tituba, an
							Indian woman, all sent to the jail in Boston, according to their <hi
								rend="italics">mittimuses,</hi> then sent to their Majesties'
							jail-keeper.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>It will be noticed that the magistrates did not venture to put into this
						their final record, what they had unfairly tried to make Sarah Osborn
						believe, that Sarah Good had been a witness against her. The jail at Ipswich
						was at a distance of at least ten miles from the village meeting-house, by
						any road that could then have been travelled. The transferrence of the
						prisoners day after day must have been very fatiguing to a sick woman like
						Sarah Osburn. Sarah Good seems to have been able to bear it. Samuel
						Braybrook, an assistant constable, having charge of her, says, that, on the
						way to Ipswich, she “leaped off her horse three times;” that she “railed
						against the magistrates, and endeavored to kill herself.” He further
						testified, that, at the very time she was performing these feats, Thomas
						Putnam daughter, “at her father's house, declared the same.” As Braybrook
						was many miles from Thomas Putnam's house, at the moment when his wonderful
						daughter exercised this miraculous extent of vision, it would have been more
						satisfactory to have had some other testimony to the fact. I mention this to
						show of what stuff the evidence in these cases was made, and the credulity
						with which every thing was swallowed. The prisoners were put to examination
						each day.</p>
					<p>Osburn and Good steadily maintained their innocence. Tituba all along
						declared herself guilty, and <pb n="031" id="vII031"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2034">
							<figDesc>Page 031.</figDesc>
						</figure> accused the other two of having been with her in confederacy with
						the Devil. Mr. Parris made the following deposition, in relation to these
						examinations, to which he subsequently swore in Court, at the trial of Sarah
						Good: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Sam: Parris,</hi> aged about
							thirty and nine years. — Testifieth and saith, that Elizabeth Parris,
							Jr., and Abigail Williams, and Ann Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard,
							were most grievously and several times tortured during the examination
							of Sarah Good, Sarah Osburn, and Tituba, Indian, before the magistrates
							at Salem Village, 1 March, 1692. And the said Tituba being the last of
							the above said that was examined, they, the above said afflicted
							persons, were grievously distressed until the said Indian began to
							confess, and then they were immediately all quiet the rest of the said
							Indian woman's examination. Also Thomas Putnam, aged about forty years,
							and Ezekiel Cheever, aged about thirty and six years, testify to the
							whole of the above said; and all the three deponents aforesaid further
							testify, that, after the said Indian began to confess, she was herself
							very much afflicted, and in the face of authority at the same time, and
							openly charged the above Good and Osburn as the persons that afflicted
							her, the aforesaid Indian.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>By comparing these depositions with the other documents I have presented, it
						will be seen how admirably the whole affair was arranged, so far as
						concerned the part played by Tituba. She commences her testimony by
						declaring her innocence. The afflicted children are instantly thrown into
						torments, which, however, <pb n="032" id="vII032"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2035">
							<figDesc>Page 032.</figDesc>
						</figure> subside as soon as she begins to confess. Immediately after
						commencing her confession, and as she proceeds in it, she herself becomes
						tormented “in the face of authority,” before the eyes of the magistrates and
						the awestruck crowd. Her power to afflict ceases as she breaks loose from
						her compact with the Devil, who sends some unseen confederate, not then
						brought to light, to weak his vengeance upon her for having confessed.
						Tituba, as well as the girls, showed herself an adept in the arts taught in
						the circle.</p>
					<p>All we know of Sarah Osburn beyond this date are the following items in the
						Boston jailer's bill “against the country,” dated May 29, 1692: “To chains
						for Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn, 14 shillings:” “To the keeping of Sarah
						Osburn, from the 7th of March to the 10th of May, when she died, being nine
						weeks and two days, ¥1. 3<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 5<hi rend="italics"
							>d.</hi>”</p>
					<p>The only further information we have of Tituba is from Calef, who says, “The
						account she since gives of it is, that her master did beat her, and
						otherwise abuse her, to make her confess and accuse (such as he called) her
						sister-witches; and that whatsoever she said by way of confessing or
						accusing others was the effect of such usage: her master refused to pay her
						fees, unless she would stand to what she had said. Calef further states that
						she laid in jail until finally “sold for her fees.” The jailer's charge for
						her “diet in prison for a year and a month” appears in a shape that
						corroborates Calef's statements, which were prepared for publication in
						1697, and printed in London in 1700. <pb n="033" id="vII033"/>

						</figure> Although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities
						connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, there is no ground to dispute
						the veracity of Calef as to matters of fact. What he says of the
						declarations of Tituba, subsequent to her examination, is quite consistent
						with a critical analysis of the details of the record of that examination.
						It can hardly be doubted, whatever the amount of severity employed to make
						her act the part assigned her, that she was used as an instrument to give
						effect to the delusion.</p>
					<p>Now let us consider the state of things that had been brought about in the
						village, and in the surrounding country, at the close of the first week in
						March, 1692. The terrible sufferings of the girls in Mr. Parris's family and
						of their associates, for the two preceding months, had become known far and
						wide. A universal sympathy was awakened in their behalf; and a sentiment of
						horrow sunk deep into all hearts, at the dread demonstration of the
						diabolical rage in their afflicted and tortured persons. A few, very few,
						distrusted; but the great majority, ninetynine in a hundred of all the
						people, were completely swept into the torrent. Nathaniel Putnam and
						Nathaniel Ingersoll were entirely deluded, and continued so to the end. Even
						Joseph Hutchinson was, for a while, carried away. The physicians had all
						given their opinion that the girls were suffering from an “evil hand.” The
						neighboring ministers, after a day's fasting and prayer, and a scrutinizing
						inspection of the condition of the afflicted children, had given it, as <pb
							n="034" id="vII034"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2037">
							<figDesc>Page 034.</figDesc>
						</figure> the result of their most solemn judgment, that it was a case of
						witchcraft. Persons from the neighboring towns had come to the place, and
						with their own eyes received demonstration of the same fact. Mr. Parris made
						it the topic of his public prayers and preaching. The girls, Sunday after
						Sunday, were under the malign influence, to the disturbance and affrightment
						of the congregation. In all companies, in all families, all the day long,
						the sufferings and distraction occurring in the houses of Mr. Parris, Thomas
						Putnam, and others, and in the meeting-house, were topics of excited
						conversation; and every voice was loud in demanding, every mind earnest to
						ascertain, who were the persons, in confederacy with the Devil, thus
						torturing, pinching, convulsing, and bringing to the last extremities of
						mortal agony, these afflicted girls. Every one felt, that, if the guilty
						authors of the mischief could not be discovered, and put out of the way, no
						one was safe for a moment. At length, when the girls cried out upon Good,
						Osburn, and Tituba, there was a general sense of satisfaction and relief. It
						was thought that Satan's power might be checked. The selection of the first
						victims was well made. They were just the kind of persons whom the public
						prejudice and credulity were prepared to suspect and condemn. Their
						examination was looked for with the utmost interest, and all flocked to
						witness the proceedings.</p>
					<p>In considering the state of mind of the people, as they crowded into and
						around the old meeting, we can have no difficulty in realizing the <pb
							n="035" id="vII035"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2038">
							<figDesc>Page 035.</figDesc>
						</figure> tremendous effects of what there occurred. It was felt that then,
						on that spot, the most momentous crisis in the world's history had come. A
						crime, in comparison with which all other crimes sink out of notice, was
						being notoriously and defiantly committed in their midst. The great enemy of
						God and man was let loose among them. What had filled the hearts of mankind
						for ages, the world over, with dread apprehension, was come to pass; and in
						that village the great battle, on whose issue the preservation of the
						kingdom of the Lord on the earth was suspended, had begun. Indeed, no
						language, no imagery, no conception of ours, can adequately express the
						feeling of awful and terrible solemnity with which all were overwhelmed. No
						body of men ever convened in a more highly wrought state of excitement than
						pervaded that assembly, when the magistrates entered, in all their stern
						authority, and the scene opened on the 1st of March, 1692. A minister,
						probably Mr. Parris, began, according to the custom of the times, with
						prayer. From what we know of his skill and talent in meeting such occasions,
						it may well be supposed that his language and manner heightened still more
						the passions of the hour. The marshal, of tall and imposing stature and
						aspect, accompanied by his constables, brought in the prisoners. Sarah Good,
						a povertystricken, wandering, and wretched victim of ill-fortune and
						ill-usage, was put to the bar. Every effort was made by the examining
						magistrate, aided by the officious interference of the marshal, or other
						deluded or <pb n="036" id="vII036"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2039">
							<figDesc>Page 036.</figDesc>
						</figure> evil-disposed persons, — who, like him, were permitted to
						interpose with charges or abusive expressions, — to overawe and confound,
						involve in contradictions, and mislead the poor creature, and force her to
						confess herself guilty and accuse others. In due time, the “afflicted
						children” were brought in; and a scene ensued, such as no person in that
						crowd or in that generation had ever witnessed before. Immediately on being
						confronted with the prisoner, and meeting her eye, they fell, as if struck
						dead, to the floor; or screeched in agony; or went into fearful spasms or
						convulsive fits; or cried out that they were pricked with pins, pinched, or
						throttled by invisible hands. They were severally brought up to the
						prisoner, and, upon touching her person, instantly became calm, quiet, and
						fully restored to their senses. With one voice they all declared that Sarah
						Good had thus tormented them, by her power as a witch in league with the
						Devil. The truth of this charge, in the effect produced by the malign
						influence proceeding from her, was thus visible to all eyes. All saw, too,
						how instantly upon touching her the diabolical effect ceased; the malignant
						fluid passing back, like an electric stream, into the body of the witch. The
						spectacle was repeated once and again, the acting perfect, and the delusion
						consummated. The magistrates and all present considered the guilt of the
						prisoner demonstrated, and regarded her as wilfully and wickedly obstinate
						in not at once confessing what her eyes, as well as theirs, saw. Her refusal
						to confess was considered as the <pb n="037" id="vII037"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2040">
							<figDesc>Page 037.</figDesc>
						</figure> highest proof of her guilt. They passed judgment against her,
						committed her to the marshal, who hurried her to prison, bound her with
						cords, and loaded her with irons; for it was thought that no ordinary
						fastenings could hold a witch. Similar proceedings, with suitable
						variations, were had with Sarah Osburn and Tituba. The confession of the
						last-named, the immediate relief thereafter of the afflicted children, and
						the dreadful torments which Tituba herself experienced, on the spot, from
						the unseen hand of the Devil wreaking vengeance upon her, put the finishing
						touch to the delusion. The excitement was kept up, and spread far and wide,
						by the officers and magistrates riding in cavalcade, day after day, to and
						from the town and village; and by the constables, with their assistants,
						carrying their manacled prisoners from jail to jail in Ipswich, Salem, and
						Boston.</p>
					<p>The point was now reached when the accusers could safely strike at higher
						game. But time was taken to mature arrangements. Great curiosity was felt to
						know who the other two were whom Tituba saw in connection with Good and
						Osburn in their hellish operations. The girls continued to suffer torments
						and fall in fits, and were constantly urged by large numbers of people,
						going from house to house to witness their sufferings, to reveal who the
						witches were that still afflicted them. When all was prepared, they began to
						cry out, with more or less distinctness; at first, in significant but
						general descriptions, and at last calling names. The next victim was also
						well chosen. An account <pb n="038" id="vII038"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2041">
							<figDesc>Page 038.</figDesc>
						</figure> has been given, in the First Part, of the notoriety which
						circumstances had attached to Giles Corey. In 1691 he became a member of the
						church, being then (Vol. I. p. 182) eighty years of age. Four daughters, all
						probably by his first wife Margaret, the only children of whom there is any
						mention, were married to John Moulton, John Parker, and Henry Crosby, of
						Salem, and William Cleaves, of Beverly. On the 11th of April, 1664, Corey
						was married to Mary Britt, who died, as appears by the inscription on her
						gravestone in the old Salem burial-ground, Aug. 27, 1684. Martha was his
						third wife. Her age is unknown. It was entered on the record of the village
						church, at the time of her admission to it, April 27, 1690; but the figures
						are worn away from the edge of the page. She was a very intelligent and
						devout person.</p>
					<p>When the proceedings relating to witchcraft began, she did not approve of
						them, and expressed her want of faith in the “afflicted children.” She
						discountenanced the whole affair, and would not follow the multitude to the
						examinations; but was said to have spoken freely of the course of the
						magistrates, saying that their eyes were blinded, and that she could open
						them. It seemed to her clear that they were violating common sense and the
						Word of God, and she was confident that she could convince them of their
						errors. Instead of falling into the delusion, she applied herself with
						renewed earnestness to keep her own mind under the influence of prayer, and
							<pb n="039" id="vII039"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2042">
							<figDesc>Page 039.</figDesc>
						</figure> spent more time in devotion than ever before. Her husband,
						however, was completely carried away by the prevalent fanaticism, believed
						all he heard, and frequented the examinations and the exhibitions of the
						afflicted children. This disagreement became quite serious. Her preferring
						to stay at home, shunning the proceedings, and expressing her disapprobation
						of what was going on, caused an estrangement between them. Her peculiar
						course created comment, in which he and two of his sons-in-law took part.
						Some strong expressions were used by him, because she acted so strangely at
						variance with everybody else. Her spending so much time on her knees in
						devotion was looked upon as a matter of suspicion. It was said that she
						tried to prevent him from following up the examinations, and went so far as
						to remove the saddle from the horse brought up to convey him to some meeting
						at the village connected with the witchcraft excitement. Angry words,
						uttered by him, were heard and repeated. As she was a woman of notable
						piety, a professor of religion, and a member of the church, it was evident
						that her case, if she were proceeded against, would still more heighten the
						panic, and convulse the public mind. It would give ground for an idea which
						the managers of the affair desired to circulate, that the Devil had
						succeeded in making inroads into the very heart of the church, and was
						bringing into confederacy with him aged and eminent church-members, who,
						under color of their profession, threatened to extend his influence to the
						overthrow of <pb n="040" id="vII040"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2043">
							<figDesc>Page 040.</figDesc>
						</figure> all religion. It was, indeed, established in the popular
						sentiments, as a sign and mark of the Devil's coming, that many professing
						godliness would join his standard.</p>
					<p>For a day or two, it was whispered round that persons in great repute for
						piety were in the diabolical confederacy, and about to be unmasked. The name
						of Martha Corey, whose open opposition to the proceedings had become known,
						was passed among the girls in an under-breath, and caught from one to
						another among those managing the affair. On the 12th of March, Edward Putnam
						and Ezekiel Cheever, having heard Ann Putnam declare that Goody Corey did
						often appear to her, and torture her by pinching and otherwise, thought it
						their duty to go to her, and see what she would say to this complaint; “she
						being in church covenant with us.” They mounted their horses about “the
						middle of the afternoon,” and first went to the house of Thomas Putnam to
						see his daughter Ann, to learn from her what clothes Goody Corey appeared to
						her in, in order to judge whether she might not have been mistaken in the
						person. The girl told them, that Goody Corey, knowing that they contemplated
						making this visit, had just appeared in spirit to her, but had blinded her
						so that she could not tell what clothes she wore. Highly wrought upon by the
						extraordinary statement of the girl, which they received with perfect
						credulity, the two brethren remounted, and pursued their way. Goody Corey
						had heard that her name had been bandied about by the accusing girls: she
						also knew that it was one of their <pb n="041" id="vII041"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2044">
							<figDesc>Page 041.</figDesc>
						</figure> arts to pretend to see the clothes people were wearing at the time
						their spectres appeared to them. This required, indeed, no great amount of
						necromancy; as it is not probable that there was much variety in the costume
						of farmer's wives, at that time, while about their ordinary domestic
						engagements.</p>
					<p>They found her alone in her house. As soon as they commenced conversation,
						“in a smiling manner she said, `I know what you are come for; you are come
						to talk with me about being a witch, but I am none: I cannot help people's
						talking of me.”' Edward Putnam acknowledged that their visit was in
						consequence of complaints made against her by the afflicted children. She
						inquired whether they had undertaken to describe the clothes she then wore.
						They answered that they had not, and proceeded to repeat what Ann Putnam had
						said to them about her blinding her so that she could not see her clothes.
						At this she smiled, no doubt at Ann's cunning artifice to escape having to
						say what dress she then had on. She declared to the two brethren, that “she
						did not think that there were any witches.” After considerable talk, in
						which they did not get much to further their purpose, they took their leave.
						The account of this interview, given by Putnam and Cheever, indicates that
						Martha Corey was a sensible, enlightened, and sprightly woman, perfectly
						free from the delusion of the day, courteous in her manners and bearing, and
						a Christian, well grounded in Scripture.</p>
					<p>The two brethren returned forthwith to Thomas <pb n="042" id="vII042"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2045">
							<figDesc>Page 042.</figDesc>
						</figure> Putnam's house. Ann told them that Goody Corey had not troubled
						her, nor her spectre appeared, in their absence. She was not inclined to
						afford them an opportunity to apply the test of the dress. Both the women
						showed great acuteness and caution. As Corey expected the visit, and had
						heard that the girls pretended to be able to say what dress persons were
						wearing, she probably had attired herself in an unusual way on the occasion,
						to put them at fault, and expose the falseness of their claims to
						preternatural knowledge; and Ann Putnam — her sagacity suggesting the risk
						she was running in the matter of Corey's dress — took refuge in the pretence
						of blindness. The brethren were too much under delusion to see through the
						sharp practice of both of them, but considered the fact of Corey's inquiring
						of them whether Ann described her dress, as, under the circumstances, proof
						positive against the former.</p>
					<p>Wishing to make assurance doubly sure, and to fasten the charge upon Martha
						Corey, the managers of the affair sent for her to come to the house of
						Thomas Putnam two days after this conference. Edward Putnam was present, and
						testified that his niece Ann, immediately upon the entrance of Goodwife
						Corey, experienced the most dreadful convulsions and tortures and distinctly
						and positively declared that Corey was the author of her sufferings. This
						was regarded as conclusive evidence; and, on the 19th of March, a warrant
						was issued for her arrest. She was brought to the house of Nathaniel
						Ingersoll, on Monday the <pb n="043" id="vII043"/>

						</figure> 21st; and the following is the account of her examination, in the
						handwriting of Mr. Parris. The proceedings took place in the meeting-house
						at the village. They were introduced by a prayer from the Rev. Nicholas
						Noyes. On some of these occasions Mr. Hale and perhaps others, but usually
						Mr. Noyes or Mr. Parris officiated. We may suppose, from what we know of
						their general deportment in connection with these scenes, that their
						performances, under the cover of a devotional exercise, expressed and
						enforced a decided prejudgment of the case in hand against the prisoners,
						and partook of the character of indictments as much as of prayers.</p>

						<p>“Salem Village, March the 21st, 1692. — The Reverend Mr. Samuel Parris,
							being desired to take, in writing, the examination of Martha Corey, hath
							returned it, as aforesaid.</p>
						<p>“Upon hearing the aforesaid, and seeing what we did then see, together
							with the charges of the persons then present, <pb n="050" id="vII050"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2053">
								<figDesc>Page 050.</figDesc>
							</figure> we committed Martha Corey, the wife of Giles Corey, of Salem
							Farms, unto the gaol in Salem, as <hi rend="italics">per mittimus</hi>
							then given out.</p>
					</q>
					<p>The foregoing is a full copy of the original document. One of Giles Corey's
						daughters, Deliverance, had married, June 5, 1683, Henry Crosby, who lived
						on land conveyed to him by her father in the immediate neighborhood. He was
						the person whose written testimony was read by the magistrate. Its purport
						seems to have been to prove that Martha Corey had said that the accusing
						girls could not stand before her, and that the Devil could not stand before
						her. She had, undoubtedly, great confidence in her own innocence, and in the
						power of truth and prayer, to silence false accusers, and expressed herself
						in the forcible language which Parris's report of the examination shows that
						she was well able to use. It is almost amusing to see how the pride of the
						magistrates was touched, and their wrath kindled, by what she was reported
						to have said, “that the magistrates' and ministers' eyes were blinded, and
						that she would open them.” It rankled in Hathorne's breast: he returns to it
						again and again, and works himself up to a higher degree of resentment on
						each recurrence. Mr. Noyes's ire was <pb n="051" id="vII051"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2054">
							<figDesc>Page 051.</figDesc>
						</figure> roused, and he, too, put in a stroke. It will be noticed, that she
						avoided a contradiction of her husband, and could not be brought to give the
						names of persons from whom she had received information. “If you will all go
						hang me, how can I help it?” “Ye are all against me.” “What can I do, when
						many rise up against me?” “When all are against me, what can I [say to] help
						it?” Situated as she was, all that she could do was to give them no
						advantage, or opportunity to ensnare her, and to avoid compromising others;
						and it must be allowed that she showed much presence and firmness of mind.
						Her request, made at the opening of the examination, and at “sundry times,”
						to “go to prayer,” somewhat confounded them. She probably was led to make
						and urge the request particularly in consequence of the tenor of Mr. Noyes's
						prayer at the opening. She felt that it was no more than fair that there
						should be a prayer on her side, as well as on the other. It might well be
						feared, that, if allowed to offer a prayer, coming from a person in her
						situation, an aged professor, and one accustomed to express herself in
						devotional exercises, it might produce a deep impression upon the whole
						assembly. To refuse such a request had a hard look; but, as the magistrates
						saw, it never would have done to have permitted it. It would have reversed
						the position of all concerned. The latter part of the examination has the
						appearance that she was suspected to be unsound on a particular article of
						the prevalent creed. It is much to be regretted that the abrasion of the
						paper at the <pb n="052" id="vII052"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2055">
							<figDesc>Page 052.</figDesc>
						</figure> folding has obliterated her last answer to this part of the
						inquisition. It is singular that Mr. Parris has left the blank in her final
						answer. Probably she used her customary expression, “I am a gospel woman.”
						The writing, at this point, is very clear and distinct; and a vacant space
						is left, just as it is given above.</p>
					<p>The fact that Martha Corey was known to be an eminently religious person, and
						very much given to acts of devotion, constituted a serious obstacle, no
						doubt, in the way of the prosecutors. Parris's record of the examination
						shows how they managed to get over it. They gave the impression that her
						frequent and long prayers were addressed to the Devil.</p>
					<p>The disagreement between her and her husband, touching the witchcraft
						prosecutions, brought him into a very uncomfortable predicament. With his
						characteristic imprudence of speech, he had probably expressed himself
						strongly against her unbelief in the sufferings of the girls and her refusal
						to attend the exhibitions of their tortures, or the examination of persons
						accused. He was, unquestionably, highly shocked and incensed at her open
						repudiation of the whole doctrine of witchcraft. Although he had become, in
						his old age, a professor and a fervently religious man, perhaps he fell
						back, in his resentment of her course, into his life-long rough phrases, and
						said that she acted as though the Devil was in her. He might have said that
						she prayed like a witch. Being entirely carried away by the delusion, he had
						his own marvellous stories to tell about his cattle's being bewitched, <pb
							n="053" id="vII053"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2056">
							<figDesc>Page 053.</figDesc>
						</figure> &amp;c. His talk, undoubtedly, came to the ears of the
						prosecutors; and they seem to have taken steps to induce him to come forward
						as a witness against her. The following document is among the papers: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“The evidence of Giles Corey testifieth and saith, that last Saturday, in
							the evening, sitting by the fire, my wife asked me to go to bed. I told
							her I would go to prayer; and, when I went to prayer, I could not utter
							my desires with any sense, nor open my mouth to speak.</p>
						<p>“My wife did perceive it, and came towards me, and said she was coming to
							me.</p>
						<p>“After this, in a little space, I did, according to my measure, attend
							the duty.</p>
						<p>“Some time last week, I fetched an ox, well, out of the woods about noon:
							and, he laying down in the yard, I went to raise him to yoke him; but he
							could not rise, but dragged his hinder parts, as if he had been
							hip-shot. But after did rise.</p>
						<p>“I had a cat sometimes last week strangely taken on the sudden, and did
							make me think she would have died presently. My wife bid me knock her in
							the head, but I did not; and since, she is well.</p>
						<p>“Another time, going to duties, I was interrupted for a space; but
							afterward I was helped according to my poor measure. My wife hath been
							wont to sit up after I went to bed; and I have perceived her to kneel
							down on the hearth, as if she were at prayer, but heard nothing.</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="italics">At the examination of Sarah</hi> Good and others, my
							wife was willing</p>
						<p>“March 24, 1692.”</p>

						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>The foregoing document does not express the idea that he thought his wife was
						a witch. He states what he observed, and what happened to him and to his
						cattle. He evidently supposed they were bewitched, and that he was
						obstructed, in going to prayer, in a strange manner; but he does not, in
						terms, charge it upon her. It gives an interesting insight of the innermost
						domestic life of the period, in a farmhouse, and exhibits striking touches
						of the character and ways of these two old people. It illustrates the state
						of the imagination prevailing among those who were carried away by the
						delusion. If an ox had a sprained muscle, or a cat a fit of indigestion, it
						was thought to be the work of an evil hand. Poor old Giles had come late to
						a religious life, and, it is to be feared, was a novice in prayer. It is no
						wonder that he was not an adept in “uttering his desires,” and experienced
						occasionally some difficulty in arranging and expressing his devotional
						sentiments.</p>
					<p>There is something very singular in the appearance of the foregoing
						deposition. Purporting to be a piece of testimony, it was not given in the
						usual and regular way. It does not indicate before whom it was made. It is
						not attested in the ordinary manner; apparently, was not sworn to in the
						presence of persons authorized to act in such cases; was never offered in
						court or anywhere. It is a disconnected paper found among the remnants of
						the miscellaneous collection in the clerk's office, and is evidently an
						unfinished document; the words in Italics, at the close, being erased by a
						line running through them.</p>
					<pb n="055" id="vII055"/>
					<p>
						<figure id="Uphv2058">
							<figDesc>Page 055.</figDesc>
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>It is probable that the parties who tried to get the old man to testify
						against his wife discovered that they could not draw any thing from him to
						answer their designs, but that there was danger that his evidence would be
						favorable to her, and gave up the attempt to use him on the occasion. The
						fact that he would not lend himself to their purposes perhaps led to
						resentment on their part, which may explain the subsequent proceedings
						against him.</p>
					<p>The document, in its chirography, suggests the idea that it was written by
						Mr. Noyes, which is not improbable, as Corey was a member of his
						congregation and church. Noyes was deeply implicated in the prosecutions,
						and violent in driving them on. The handwriting of the original papers
						reveals the agency of those who were the most busy in procuring evidence
						against persons accused. That of Thomas Putnam occurs in very many
						instances. But Mr. Parris was, beyond all others, the busiest and most
						active prosecutor. The depositions of the child Abigail Williams, his niece
						and a member of his family, were written by him, as also a great number of
						others. He took down most of the examinations, put in a deposition of his
						own whenever he could, and was always ready to indorse those of others.</p>

					<p>It will be remembered, that, when Tituba was put through her examination, she
						said “four women sometimes hurt the children.” She named Good and Osburn,
						but pretended to have been blinded as to the others. Martha Corey was, in
						due time, as we <pb n="056" id="vII056"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2059">
							<figDesc>Page 056.</figDesc>
						</figure> have seen, brought out. The fourth was the venerable head of a
						large and prominent family, and a member of the mother-church in Salem. She
						had never transferred her relations to the village church, with which,
						however, she had generally worshipped, and probably communed. Being one of
						the chief matrons of the place, she was seated in the meeting-house with
						ladies of similar age and standing, occupying the same bench or compartment
						with the widow of Thomas Putnam, Sr. The women were seated separately from
						the men; and the only rule applied among them was eminence in years and
						respectability.</p>
					<p>It has always been considered strange and unaccountable, that a person of
						such acknowledged worth as Rebecca Nurse, of infirm health and advanced
						years, should have been selected among the early victims of the witchcraft
						prosecutions. Jealousies and prejudices, such as often infest rural
						neighborhoods, may have been engendered, in minds open to such influences,
						by the prosperity and growing influence of her family. It may be that
						animosities kindled by the long and violent land controversy, with which
						many parties had been incidentally connected, lingered in some breasts.
						There are decided indications, that the passions awakened by the angry
						contest between the village and “Topsfield men,” and which the collisions of
						a half-century had all along exasperated and hardened, may have been
						concentrated against the Nurses. Isaac Easty, whose wife was a sister of
						Rebecca Nurse, and the Townes, who were her brothers or near kinsmen, <pb
							n="057" id="vII057"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2060">
							<figDesc>Page 057.</figDesc>
						</figure> were the leaders of the Topsfield men. It is a significant
						circumstance, in this connection, that to one of the most vehement
						resolutions passed at meetings of the inhabitants of the village, against
						the claims of Topsfield, Samuel Nurse, her eldest son, and Thomas Preston,
						her eldest son-in-law, entered their protest on the record; and, on another
						similar occasion, her husband Francis Nurse, her son Samuel, and two of her
						sons-in-law, Preston and Tarbell, took the same course. So far as the family
						sided with Topsfield in that controversy, it naturally exposed them to the
						ill-will of the people of the village. An analysis of the names and
						residences of the persons proceeded against, throughout the prosecutions,
						will show to what an extent hostile motives were supplied from this quarter.
						The families of Wildes, How, Hobbs, Towne, Easty, and others who were “cried
						out” upon by the afflicted children, occupied lands claimed by parties
						adverse to the village. What, more than all these causes, was sufficient to
						create a feeling against the Nurses, is the fact that they were opposed to
						the party which had existed from the beginning in the parish composed
						originally of the friends of Bayley. To crown the whole, when the excitement
						occasioned by the extraordinary doings in Mr. Parris's family began to
						display itself, and the “afflicted children” were brought into notice, the
						members of this family, with the exception, for a time, of Thomas Preston,
						discountenanced the whole thing. They absented themselves from meeting, on
						account of the disturbances <pb n="058" id="vII058"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2061">
							<figDesc>Page 058.</figDesc>
						</figure> and disorders the girls were allowed to make during the services
						of worship, in the congregation, on the Lord's Day. Unfriendly remarks, from
						whatever cause, made in the hearing of the girls, provided subjects for them
						to act upon. Some persons behind them, suggesting names in this way, whether
						carelessly or with malicious intent, were guilty of all the misery that was
						created and blood that was shed.</p>
					<p>It became a topic of rumor, that Rebecca Nurse was soon to be brought out. It
						reached the ears of her friends, and the following document comes in at this
						point: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“We whose names are underwritten being desired to go to Goodman Nurse his
							house, to speak with his wife, and to tell her that several of the
							afflicted persons mentioned her; and accordingly we went, and we found
							her in a weak and low condition in body as she told us, and had been
							sick almost a week. And we asked how it was otherwise with her: and she
							said she blessed God for it, she had more of his presence in this
							sickness than sometime she have had, but not so much as she desired; but
							she would, with the apostle, press forward to the mark; and many other
							places of Scripture to the like purpose. And then, of her own accord,
							she began to speak of the affliction that was amongst them, and in
							particular of Mr. Parris his family, and how she was grieved for them,
							though she had not been to see them, by reason of fits that she formerly
							used to have; for people said it was awful to behold: but she pitied
							them with all her heart, and went to God for them. But she said she
							heard that there was persons spoke of that were as innocent as she was,
							she believed; and, after much to this purpose, <pb n="059" id="vII059"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2062">
								<figDesc>Page 059.</figDesc>
							</figure> we told her we heard that she was spoken of also. `Well,' she
							said, `if it be so, the will of the Lord be done:' she sat still a
							while, being as it were amazed; and then she said, `Well, as to this
							thing I am as innocent as the child unborn; but surely,' she said, `what
							sin hath God found out in me unrepented of, that he should lay such an
							affliction upon me in my old age?' and, according to our best
							observation, we could not discern that she knew what we came for before
							we told her. <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel Porter,</hi></p>

					</q>
					<p>Elizabeth Porter, who joins her husband in making this statement, was a
						sister of John Hathorne, the examining magistrate, and the mother-in-law of
						Joseph Putnam, who was among the very few that condemned the proceedings
						from the first. She stood, therefore, between the two parties. The character
						of each of the signers and indorsers of this interesting paper is sufficient
						proof that its statements are truthful. It cannot but excite the most
						affecting sensibilities in every breast. This venerable lady, whose
						conversation and bearing were so truly saint-like, was an invalid of
						extremely delicate condition and appearance, the mother of a large family,
						embracing sons, daughters, grandchildren, and one or more great. She was a
						woman of piety, and simplicity of heart. In all probability, she shared in
						the popular belief on the subject of witchcraft, and supposed <pb n="060"
							id="vII060"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2063">
							<figDesc>Page 060.</figDesc>
						</figure> that the sufferings of the children were real, and that they were
						afflicted by an “evil hand.” At the very time that she was sorrowfully
						sympathizing with them and Mr. Parris's family, and praying for them, they
						were circulating suspicions against her, and maturing their plans for her
						destruction.</p>
					<p>Rebecca Nurse was a daughter of William Towne, of Yarmouth, Norfolk County,
						England, where she was baptized, Feb. 21, 1621. Her sister Mary, who married
						Isaac Easty, was baptized at the same place, Aug. 24, 1634. The records of
						the First Church at Salem, Sept. 3, 1648, give the baptism of “Joseph and
						Sarah, children of Sister Towne.” Sarah was at that time seven years of age.
						She became the wife of Edmund Bridges, and afterwards of Peter Cloyse.</p>
					<p>On the 23d of March, a warrant was issued, on complaint of Edward Putnam, and
						Jonathan, son of John Putnam, for the arrest of “Rebecca, wife of Francis
						Nurse;” and the next morning, at eight o'clock, she was brought to the house
						of Nathaniel Ingersoll, in the custody of George Herrick, the marshal of
						Essex. There were several distinct indictments, four of which, for having
						practised “certain detestable arts called witchcraft” upon Ann Putnam, Mary
						Walcot, Elizabeth Hubbard, and Abigail Williams, are preserved. The
						examination took place forthwith at the meeting-house. The age, character,
						connections, and appearance of the prisoner, made the occasion one of the
						extremest interest. Hathorne, the magistrate, began the proceedings by
						addressing one of the afflicted: <pb n="061" id="vII061"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2064">
							<figDesc>Page 061.</figDesc>
						</figure> “What do you say? Have you seen this woman hurt you?” The answer
						was, “Yes, she beat me this morning.” Hathorne, addressing another of the
						afflicted, said, “Abigail, have you been hurt by this woman?” Abigail
						answered, “Yes.” At that point, Ann Putnam fell into a grievous fit, and,
						while in her spasms, cried out that it was Rebecca Nurse who was thus
						afflicting her. As soon as Ann's fit was over, and order restored, Hathorne
						said, “Goody Nurse, here are two, Ann Putnam the child, and Abigail
						Williams, complain of your hurting them. What do you say to it?” The
						prisoner replied, “I can say, before my eternal Father, I am innocent, and
						God will clear my innocency.” Hathorne, apparently touched for the moment by
						her language and bearing, said, “Here is never a one in the assembly but
						desires it; but, if you be guilty, pray God discover you.” Henry Kenney rose
						up from the body of the assembly to speak. Hathorne permitted the
						interruption, and said, “Goodman Kenney, what do you say?” Then Kenney
						complained of the prisoner, “and further said, since this Nurse came into
						the house, he was seized twice with an amazed condition.” Hathorne,
						addressing the prisoner, said, “Not only these, but the wife of Mr. Thomas
						Putnam, accuseth you by credible information, and that both of tempting her
						to iniquity and of greatly hurting her.” The prisoner again affirmed her
						innocence, and said, in answer to the charge of having hurt these persons,
						that “she had not been able to get out of doors these eight or nine days.”
							<pb n="062" id="vII062"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2065">
							<figDesc>Page 062.</figDesc>
						</figure> Hathorne then called upon Edward Putnam, who, as the record says,
						“gave in his relate,” which undoubtedly was a statement of his having seen
						the afflicted in their sufferings, and heard them accuse Rebecca Nurse as
						their tormentor. Hathorne said, “Is this true, Goody Nurse?” She denied that
						she had ever hurt them or any one else in her life. Hathorne repeated, “You
						see these accuse you: is it true?” She answered, “No.” He again put the
						question, “Are you an innocent person relating to this witchcraft?” It
						seems, from his manner, that he was beginning really to doubt whether she
						might not be innocent; and perhaps the feeling of the multitude was yielding
						in her favor.</p>
					<p>Here Thomas Putnam's wife cried out, “Did you not bring the black man with
						you? Did you not bid me tempt God, and die? How oft have you eat and drank
						your own damnation?” This sudden outbreak, from such a source, accompanied
						with the wild and apparently supernatural energy and uncontrollable
						vehemence with which the words were uttered, roused the multitude to the
						utmost pitch of horror; and the prisoner seems to have been shocked at the
						dreadful exhibition of madness in the woman and in the assembly. Releasing
						her hands from confinement, she spread them out towards heaven, and
						exclaimed, “O Lord, help me!” Instantly, the whole company of the afflicted
						children “were grievously vexed.” After a while, the tumult subsided, and
						Hathorne again addressed her, “Do you not see what a solemn condition <pb
							n="063" id="vII063"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2066">
							<figDesc>Page 063.</figDesc>
						</figure> these are in? When your hands are loosed, the persons are
						afflicted.” Then Mary Walcot and Elizabeth Hubbard came forward, and accused
						her. Hathorne again addressed her, “Here are these two grown persons now
						accuse. What say you? Do not you see these afflicted persons, and hear them
						accuse you?” She answered, “The Lord knows I have not hurt them. I am an
						innocent person.” Hathorne continued, “It is very awful to all to see these
						agonies, and you, an old professor, thus charged with contracting with the
						Devil by the effects of it, and yet to see you stand with dry eyes where
						there are so many wet.” She answered, “You do not know my heart.” Hathorne,
						“You would do well, if you are guilty, to confess, and give glory to God.” —
						“I am as clear as the child unborn.” Hathorne continued, “What uncertainty
						there may be in apparitions, I know not: yet this with me strikes hard upon
						you, that you are, at this very present, charged with familiar spirits, —
						this is your bodily person they speak to; they say now they see these
						familiar spirits come to your bodily person. Now, what do you say to that?”
						— “I have none, sir.” — “If you have, confess, and give glory to God. I pray
						God clear you, if you be innocent, and, if you are guilty, discover you; and
						therefore give me an upright answer. Have you any familiarity with these
						spirits?” — “No: I have none but with God alone.” It looks as if again the
						magistrate began to open his mind to a fair view of the case. He seems to
						have sought satisfaction in reference to all the charges <pb n="064"
							id="vII064"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2067">
							<figDesc>Page 064.</figDesc>
						</figure> that had been made against her. She was suffering from infirmities
						of body, the result not only of age, but of the burdens of life often
						pressing down the physical frame, particularly of those who have borne large
						families of children. The magistrate had heard some malignant gossip of this
						kind, and he asked, “How came you sick? for there is an odd discourse of
						that in the mouths of many.” She replied that she suffered from weakness of
						stomach. He inquired, more specifially, “Have you no wounds?” Her answer
						was, that her ailments and weaknesses, all her bodily infirmities, were the
						natural effects of what she had experienced in a long life. “I have none but
						old age.” — “You do know whether you are guilty, and have familiarity with
						the Devil; and now, when you are here present, to see such a thing as these
						testify, — a black man whispering in your ear, and birds about you, — what
						do you say to it?” — “It is all false: I am clear.” — “Possibly, you may
						apprehend you are no witch; but have you not been led aside by temptations
						that way?” — “I have not.” At this point, it almost seems that Hathorne was
						yielding to the moral effect of the evidence she bore in her deportment and
						language, the impress of conscious innocence in her countenance, and the
						manifestation of true Christian purity and integrity in her whole manner and
						bearing. Instead of pressing her with further interrogatories, he gave way
						to an expression, in the form of a soliloquy or ejaculation, “What a sad
						thing is it, that a church-member here, and now another of Salem, <pb
							n="065" id="vII065"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2068">
							<figDesc>Page 065.</figDesc>
						</figure> should thus be accused and charged!” Upon hearing this rather
						ambiguous expression of the magistrate, Mrs. Pope fell into a grievous
						fit.</p>
					<p>Mrs. Pope was the wife of Joseph Pope, living with his mother, the widow
						Gertrude Pope, on the farm shown on the map. She had followed up the
						meetings of the circle, been a constant witness of the sufferings of the
						“afflicted children,” and attended all the public examinations, until her
						nervous system was excited beyond restraint, and for a while she went into
						fits and her imagination was bewildered. She acted with the accusers, and
						participated in their sufferings. On some occasions, her conduct was wild
						and extravagant to the highest degree. At the examination of Martha Corey,
						she was conspicuous for the violence of her actions. In the midst of the
						proceedings, and in the presence of the magistrates and hundreds of people,
						she threw her muff at the prisoner; and, that missing, pulled off her shoe,
						and, more successful this time, hit her square on the head. Hers seems,
						however, to have been a case of mere delusion, amounting to temporary
						insanity. That it was not deliberate and cold-blooded imposture is rendered
						probable by the fact, that she was rescued from the hallucination, and, with
						her husband, among the foremost to deplore and denounce the whole affair.
						But, when a woman of her position acted in this manner, on such an occasion,
						and then went into convulsions, and the whole company of afflicted persons
						joined in, the confusion, tumult, and frightfulness of <pb n="066"
							id="vII066"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2069">
							<figDesc>Page 066.</figDesc>
						</figure> the scene can hardly be imagined, certainly it cannot be described
						in words.</p>
					<p>Quiet being restored, Hathorne proceeded: “Tell us, have you not had visible
						appearances, more than what is common in nature?” — “I have none, nor never
						had in my life.” — “Do you think these suffer voluntary or involuntary?” —
						“I cannot tell.” — “That is strange: every one can judge.” — “I must be
						silent.” — “They accuse you of hurting them; and, if you think it is not
						unwillingly, but by design, you must look upon them as murderers.” — “I
						cannot tell what to think of it.” This answer was considered as very
						aspersive in its bearing upon the witnesses, and she was charged with having
						called them murderers. Being hard of hearing, she did not always take in the
						whole import of questions put to her. She denied that she said she thought
						them murderers; all she said, and that she stood to to the last, was that
						she could not tell what to make of their conduct. Finally, Hathorne put this
						question, and called for an answer, “Do you think these suffer against their
						wills or not?” She answered, “I do not think these suffer against their
						wills.” To this point she was not afraid or unwilling to go, in giving an
						opinion of the conduct of the accusing girls. Infirm, half deaf,
						crossquestioned, circumvented, surrounded with folly, uproar, and outrage,
						as she was, they could not intimidate her to say less, or entrap her to say
						more.</p>
					<p>Then another line of criminating questions was started by the magistrate:
						“Why did you never visit <pb n="067" id="vII067"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2070">
							<figDesc>Page 067.</figDesc>
						</figure> these afflicted persons?” — “Because I was afraid I should have
						fits too.” On every motion of her body, “fits followed upon the
						complainants, abundantly and very frequently.” As soon as order was again
						restored, Hathorne, being, as he always was, wholly convinced of the reality
						of the sufferings of the “afflicted children,” addressed her thus, “Is it
						not an unaccountable case, that, when you are examined, these persons are
						afflicted?” Seeing that he and the whole assembly put faith in the accusers,
						her only reply was, “I have got nobody to look to but God.” As she uttered
						these words, she naturally attempted to raise her hands, whereupon “the
						afflicted persons were seized with violent fits of torture.” After silence
						was again restored, the magistrate pressed his questions still closer. “Do
						you believe these afflicted persons are bewitched?” She answered, “I do
						think they are.” It will be noticed that there was this difference between
						Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey: The latter was an utter heretic on the point
						of the popular faith respecting witchcraft; she did not believe that there
						were any witches, and she looked upon the declarations and actions of the
						“afflicted children” as the ravings of “distracted persons.” The former
						seems to have held the opinions of the day, and had no disbelief in
						witchcraft: she was willing to admit that the children were bewitched; but
						she knew her own innocence, and nothing could move her from the
						consciousness of it. Mr. Hathorne continued, “When this witchcraft came upon
						the stage, there was no suspicion <pb n="068" id="vII068"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2071">
							<figDesc>Page 068.</figDesc>
						</figure> of Tituba, Mr. Parris's Indian woman. She professed much love to
						that child, — Betty Parris; but it was her apparition did the mischief: and
						why should not you also be guilty, for your apparition doth hurt also?” Her
						answer was, “Would you have me belie myself?” Weary, probably, of the
						protracted proceedings, her head drooped on one side; and forthwith the
						necks of the afflicted children were bent in the same way. This new
						demonstration of the diabolical power that proceeded from her filled the
						house with increased awe, and spread horrible conviction of her guilt
						through all minds. Elizabeth Hubbard's neck was fixed in that direction, and
						could not be moved. Abigail Williams cried out, “Set up Goody Nurse's head,
						the maid's neck will be broke.” Whereupon, some persons held the prisoner's
						head up, and “Aaron Way observed that Betty Hubbard's was immediately
						righted.” To consummate the effect of the whole proceeding, Mr. Parris, by
						direction of the magistrates, “read what he had in characters taken from Mr.
						Thomas Putnam's wife in her fits.” We shall come to the matter thus
						introduced by Mr. Parris, at a future stage of the story. It is sufficient
						here to say, that it contained the most positive and minute declarations
						that the apparition of Rebecca Nurse had appeared to her, on several
						occasions, and horribly tortured her. After hearing Parris's statement,
						Hathorne asked the prisoner, “What do you think of this?” Her reply was, “I
						cannot help it: the Devil may appear in my shape.” It may be mentioned, that
						Mrs. Ann Putnam was present during this <pb n="069" id="vII069"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2072">
							<figDesc>Page 069.</figDesc>
						</figure> examination, and, in the course of it, went into the most dreadful
						bodily agony, charging it on Rebecca Nurse. Her sufferings were so violent,
						and held on so long, that the magistrates gave permission to her husband to
						carry her out of the meeting-house, to free her from the malignant presence
						of the prisoner. The record of the examination closes thus: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Salem Village, March 24th, 169½. — The Reverend Mr. Samuel Parris, being
							desired to take in writing the examination of Rebecca Nurse, hath
							returned it as aforesaid.</p>
						<p>“Upon hearing the aforesaid, and seeing what we then did see, together
							with the charges of the persons then present, we committed Rebecca
							Nurse, the wife of Francis Nurse of Salem Village, unto Her Majesty's
							jail in Salem, as <hi rend="italics">per mittimus</hi> then given out,
							in order to further examination.</p>
					</q>
					<p>The presence of Ann Putnam, the mother, on this occasion; the statement from
						her, read by Mr. Parris; and the terrible sufferings she exhibited,
						produced, no doubt, a deep effect upon the magistrates and all present. Her
						social position and personal appearance undoubtedly contributed to heighten
						it. For two months, her house had been the constant scene of the
						extraordinary actings of the circle of girls of which her daughter and
						maid-servant were the leading spirits. <pb n="070" id="vII070"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2073">
							<figDesc>Page 070.</figDesc>
						</figure> Her mind had been absorbed in the mysteries of spiritualism. The
						marvels of necromancy and magic had been kept perpetually before it. She had
						been living in the invisible world, with a constant sense of supernaturalism
						surrounding her. Unconsciously, perhaps, the passions, prejudices,
						irritations, and animosities, to which she had been subject, became mixed
						with the vagaries of an excited imagination; and, laid open to the inroads
						of delusion as her mind had long been by perpetual tamperings with spiritual
						ideas and phantoms, she may have lost the balance of reason and sanity.
						This, added to a morbid sensibility, probably gave a deep intensity to her
						voice, action, and countenance. The effect upon the excited multitude must
						have been very great. Although she lived to realize the utter falseness of
						all her statements, her monstrous fictions were felt by her, at the time, to
						be a reality.</p>
					<p>In concluding his report of this examination, Mr. Parris says, “By reason of
						great noises by the afflicted and many speakers, many things are
						pretermitted.” He was probably quite willing to avoid telling the whole
						story of the disgraceful and shocking scenes enacted in the meeting-house
						that day. Deodat Lawson was present during the earlier part of the
						proceedings. He says that Mr. Hale began with prayer; that the prisoner
						“pleaded her innocency with earnestness;” that, at the opening, some of the
						girls, Mary Walcot among them, declared that the prisoner had never hurt
						them. Presently, however, Mary Walcot screamed out that she was bitten, and
						charged <pb n="071" id="vII071"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2074">
							<figDesc>Page 071.</figDesc>
						</figure> it upon Rebecca Nurse. The marks of teeth were produced on her
						wrist. Lawson says, “It was so disposed that I had not leisure to attend the
						whole time of examination.” The meaning is, I suppose, that he desired to
						withdraw into the neighboring fields to con over his manuscript, and make
						himself more able to perform with effect the part he was to act that
						afternoon. “There was once,” he says, “such an hideous screech and noise
						(which I heard as I walked at a little distance from the meeting-house) as
						did amaze me; and some that were within told me the whole assembly was
						struck with consternation, and they were afraid that those that sat next to
						them were under the influence of witchcraft.” The whole congregation was in
						an uproar, every one afflicted by and affrighting every other, amid a
						universal outcry of terror and horror.</p>
					<p>As it was a part of the policy of the managers of the business to utterly
						overwhelm the influence of all natural sentiment in the community, they
						coupled with this proceeding against a venerable and infirm
						great-grandmother, another of the same kind against a little child.
						Immediately after the examination of Rebecca Nurse was concluded, Dorcas, a
						daughter of Sarah Good, was brought before the magistrates. She was between
						four and five years old. Lawson says, “The child looked hale and well as
						other children.” A warrant had been issued for her apprehension, the day
						before, on complaint of Edward and Jonathan Putnam. Herrick the marshal, who
						was a man that magnified his office, and of much personal pride, did <pb
							n="072" id="vII072"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2075">
							<figDesc>Page 072.</figDesc>
						</figure> not, perhaps, fancy the idea of bringing up such a little
						prisoner; and he deputized the operation to Samuel Braybrook, who, the next
						morning, made return, in due form, that “he had taken the body of Dorcas
						Good,” and sent her to the house of Nathaniel Ingersoll, where she was in
						custody. It seems that Braybrook did not like the job, and passed the
						handling of the child over to still another. Whoever performed the service
						probably brought her in his arms, or on a pillion. The little thing could
						not have walked the distance from Benjamin Putnam's farm. When led in to be
						examined, Ann Putnam, Mary Walcot, and Mercy Lewis, all charged her with
						biting, pinching, and almost choking them. The two former went through their
						usual evolutions in the presence of the awe and terror stricken magistrates
						and multitude. They showed the marks of her little teeth on their arms; and
						the pins with which she pricked them were found on their bodies, precisely
						where, in their shrieks, they had averred that she was piercing them. The
						evidence was considered overwhelming; and Dorcas was, <hi rend="italics">per
							mittimus,</hi> committed to the jail, where she joined her mother. By
						the bill of the Boston jailer, it appears that they both were confined
						there: as they were too poor to provide for themselves, “the country” was
						charged with ten shillings for “two blankets for Sarah Good's child.” The
						mother, we know, was kept in chains; the child was probably chained too.
						Extraordinary fastenings, as has been stated, were thought necessary to hold
						a witch.</p>
					<pb n="073" id="vII073"/>

					</p>
					<p>There was no longer any doubt, in the mass of the community, that the Devil
						had effected a lodgement at Salem Village. Church-members, persons of all
						social positions, of the highest repute and profession of piety, eminent for
						visible manifestations of devotion, and of every age, had joined his
						standard, and become his active allies and confederates.</p>
					<p>The effect of these two examinations was unquestionably very great in
						spreading consternation and bewilderment far and wide; but they were only
						the prelude to the work, to that end, arranged for the day. The public mind
						was worked to red heat, and now was the moment to strike the blow that would
						fix an impression deep and irremovable upon it. It was Thursday,
						Lecture-day; and the public services usual on the occasion were to be held
						at the meeting-house.</p>
					<p>Deodat Lawson had arrived at the village on the 19th of March, and lodged at
						Deacon Ingersoll's. The fact at once became known; and Mary Walcot
						immediately went to the deacon's to see him. She had a fit on the spot,
						which filled Lawson with amazement and horror. His turn of mind led him to
						be interested in such an excitement; and he had become additionally and
						specially exercised by learning that the afflicted persons had intimated
						that the deaths of his wife and daughter, which occurred during his ministry
						at the village, had been brought about by the diabolical agency of the
						persons then beginning to be unmasked, and brought to justice. He was
						prepared to listen to the hints thus thrown out, and was ready to push <pb
							n="074" id="vII074"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2077">
							<figDesc>Page 074.</figDesc>
						</figure> the prosecutions on with an earnestness in which resentment and
						rage were mingled with the blindest credulity. After Mary Walcot had given
						him a specimen of what the girls were suffering, he walked over, early in
						the evening, to Mr. Parris's house; and there Abigail Williams went into the
						craziest manifestations, throwing firebrands about the house in the presence
						of her uncle, rushing to the back of the chimney as though she would fly up
						through its wide flue, and performing many wonderful works. The next day
						being Sunday, he preached; and the services were interrupted, in the manner
						already described, by the outbreaks of the afflicted, under diabolic
						influence. The next day, he attended the examination of Martha Corey. On
						Wednesday, the 23d, he went up to Thomas Putnam's, as he says, “on purpose
						to see his wife.” He “found her lying on the bed, having had a sore fit a
						little before: her husband and she both desired me to pray with her while
						she was sensible, which I did, though the apparition said I should not go to
						prayer. At the first beginning, she attended; but, after a little time, was
						taken with a fit, yet continued silent, and seemed to be asleep.” She had
						represented herself as being in conflict with the shape, or spectre, of a
						witch, which, she told Lawson, said he should not pray on the occasion. But
						he courageously ventured on the work. At the conclusion of the prayer, “her
						husband, going to her, found her in a fit. He took her off the bed to sit
						her on his knees; but at first she was so stiff she could not be bended, but
						she afterwards <pb n="075" id="vII075"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2078">
							<figDesc>Page 075.</figDesc>
						</figure> sat down.” Then she went into that state of supernatural vision
						and exaltation in which she was accustomed to utter the wildest strains, in
						fervid, extravagant, but solemn and melancholy, rhapsodies: she disputed
						with the spectre about a text of Scripture, and then poured forth the most
						terrible denunciations upon it for tormenting and tempting her. She was
						evidently a very intellectual and imaginative woman, and was perfectly
						versed in all the imagery and lofty diction supplied by the prophetic and
						poetic parts of Scripture. Again she was seized with a terrible fit, that
						lasted “near half an hour.” At times, her mouth was drawn on one side and
						her body strained. At last she broke forth, and succeeded, after many
						violent struggles against the spectre and many convulsions of her frame, in
						saying what part of the Bible Lawson was to read aloud, in order to relieve
						her. “It is,” she said, “the third chapter of the Revelation.” — “I did,”
						says Lawson, “something scruple the reading it.” He was loath to be engaged
						in an affair of that kind in which the Devil was an actor. At length he
						overcame his scruples, and the effect was decisive. “Before I had near read
						through the first verse, she opened her eyes, and was well.” Bewildered and
						amazed, he went back to Parris's house, and they talked over the awful
						manifestations of Satan's power. The next morning, he attended the
						examination of Rebecca Nurse, retiring from it, at an early hour, to
						complete his preparation for the service that had been arranged for him that
						afternoon.</p>
					<pb n="076" id="vII076"/>
					<p>

						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>I say arranged, because the facts in this case prove long-concerted
						arrangement. He was to preach a sermon that day. Word must have been sent to
						him weeks before. After reaching the village, every hour had been occupied
						in exciting spectacles and engrossing experiences, filling his mind with the
						fanatical enthusiasm requisite to give force and fire to the delivery of the
						discourse. He could not possibly have written it after coming to the place.
						He must have brought it in his pocket. It is a thoroughly elaborated and
						carefully constructed performance, requiring long and patient application to
						compose it, and exhausting all the resources of theological research and
						reference, and of artistic skill and finish. It is adapted to the details of
						an occasion which was prepared to meet it. Not only the sermon but the
						audience were the result of arrangement carefully made in the stages of
						preparation and in the elements comprised in it. The preceding steps had all
						been seasonably and appositely taken, so that, when the regular lecture
						afternoon came, Lawson would have his voluminous discourse ready, and a
						congregation be in waiting to hear it, with minds suitably wrought upon by
						the preceding incidents of the day, to be thoroughly and permanently
						impressed by it. The occasion had been heralded by a train of circumstances
						drawing everybody to the spot. The magistrates were already there, some of
						them by virtue of the necessity of official presence in the earlier part of
						the day, and others came in from the neighborhood; the ministers gathered
						from <pb n="077" id="vII077"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2080">
							<figDesc>Page 077.</figDesc>
						</figure> the towns in the vicinity; men and women came from all quarters,
						flocking along the highways and the by, large numbers on horseback, and
						crowds on foot. Probably the village meeting-house, and the grounds around
						it, presented a spectacle such as never was exhibited elsewhere. Awe, dread,
						earnestness, a stern but wild fanaticism, were stamped on all countenances,
						and stirred the heaving multitude to its depths, and in all its movements
						and utterances. It is impossible to imagine a combination of circumstances
						that could give greater advantage and power to a speaker, and Lawson was
						equal to the situation. No discourse was ever more equal, or better adapted,
						to its occasion. It was irresistible in its power, and carried the public
						mind as by storm.</p>
					<p>The text is Zechariah, iii. 2: “And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke
						thee, O Satan! even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
						this a brand plucked out of the fire?” After an allusion to the rebellion of
						Satan, and his fall from heaven with his “accursed legions,” and after
						representing them as filled “with envy and malice against all mankind,”
						seeking “by all ways and means to work their ruin and destruction for ever,
						opposing to the utmost all persons and things appointed by the Lord Jesus
						Christ as means or instruments of their comfort here or salvation
						hereafter,” he proceeds, in the manner of those days, to open his text and
						spread out his subject, all along exhibiting great ability, skill, and
						power, showing learning in his illustrations, drawing <pb n="078"
							id="vII078"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2081">
							<figDesc>Page 078.</figDesc>
						</figure> aptly and abundantly from the Scriptures, and, at the right
						points, rising to high strains of eloquence in diction and imagery.</p>
					<p>He describes, at great length and with abundant instances ingeniously
						selected from sacred and profane literature, the marvellous power with which
						Satan is enabled to operate upon mankind. He says, —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“He is a spirit, and hence strikes at the spiritual part, the most
							excellent (constituent) part of man. Primarily disturbing and
							interrupting the animal and vital spirits, he maliciously operates upon
							the more common powers of the soul by strange and frightful
							representations to the fancy or imagination; and, by violent tortures of
							the body, often threatening to extinguish life, as hath been observed in
							those that are afflicted amongst us. And not only so, but he vents his
							malice in diabolical operations on the more sublime and distinguishing
							faculties of the rational soul, raising mists of darkness and ignorance
							in the understanding.... Sometimes he brings distress upon the bodies of
							men, by malignant operations in, and diabolical impressions on, the
							spirituous principle or vehicle of life and motion.... There are
							certainly some lower operations of Satan (whereof there are sundry
							examples among us), which the bodies and souls of men and women are
							liable unto. And whosoever hath carefully observed those things must
							needs be convinced, that the motions of the persons afflicted, both as
							to the manner and as to the violence of them, are the mere effects of
							diabolical malice and operations, and that it cannot rationally be
							imagined to proceed from any other cause whatever.... Satan exerts his
							malice mediately by employing some of mankind and other creatures, and
							he frequently <pb n="079" id="vII079"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2082">
								<figDesc>Page 079.</figDesc>
							</figure> useth other persons or things, that his designs may be the
							more undiscernible. Thus he used the serpent in the first temptation
							(Gen. iii. 1). Hence he contracts and indents with witches and wizards,
							that they shall be the instruments by whom he may more secretly affect
							and afflict the bodies and minds of others; and, if he can prevail upon
							those that make a visible profession, it may be the better covert unto
							his diabolical enterprise, and may the more readily pervert others to
							consenting unto his subjection. So far as we can look into those hellish
							mysteries, and guess at the administration of that kingdom of darkness,
							we may learn that witches make witches by persuading one the other to
							subscribe to a book or articles, &amp;c.; and the Devil, having them in
							his subjection, by their consent, he will use their bodies and minds,
							shapes and representations, to affright and afflict others at his
							pleasure, for the propagation of his infernal kingdom, and accomplishing
							his devised mischiefs to the souls, bodies, and lives of the children of
							men, yea, and of the children of God too, so far as permitted and is
							possible.... He insinuates into the society of the adopted children of
							God, in their most solemn approaches to him, in sacred ordinances,
							endeavoring to look so like the true saints and ministers of Christ,
							that, if it were possible, he would deceive the very elect (Matt. xxiv.
							24) by his subtilty: for it is certain he never works more like the
							Prince of darkness than when he looks most like an angel of light; and,
							when he most pretends to holiness, he then doth most secretly, and by
							consequence most surely, undermine it, and those that most excel in the
							exercise thereof.”</p>

						<p>“The application of this doctrine to ourselves remains now to be
							attended. Let it be for solemn warning and awakening to all of us that
							are before the Lord at this time, and to all others of this whole
							people, who shall come to the knowledge of these direful operations of

						<p>“The Lord doth terrible things amongst us, by lengthening the chain of

							country also, with an unusual and amazing loudness. Surely, it warns us
							to awaken out of all sleep, of security or stupidity, to arise, and take
							our Bibles, turn to, and learn that lesson, not by rote only, but by
							heart. 1 Pet. v. 8: `Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the

							permission whereof the provoked God as a lion hath roared, who can but
							fear? the Lord hath spoken, who can but prophesy? (Amos iii. 8.) The

							to be deeply humbled, and sit in the dust, considering the signal hand
							of God in singling out this place, this poor village, for the first seat
							of Satan's tyranny, and to make it (as 'twere the rendezvous of devils,

							coming armed to carry on their malicious designs against the bodies,
							and, if God in mercy prevent not, against the souls, of many in this
							place.... Be humbled also that so many members of this church of the
							Lord Jesus Christ should be under the influences of Satan's malice in
							these his operations; some as the objects of his tyranny on their bodies
							to that degree of distress which none can be sensible of but those that
							see and feel it, who are in the mean time also sorely distressed in
							their minds by frightful representations made by the devils unto them.
							Other professors and visible members of this church are under the awful
							accusations and imputations of being the instruments of Satan in his
							mischievous actings. It cannot but be matter of deep humiliation, to
							such as are innocent, that the righteous and holy God should permit them
							to be named in such pernicious and unheard-of practices, and not only
							so, but that he who cannot but do right should suffer the stain of
							suspected guilt to be, as it were, rubbed on and <pb n="082" id="vII082"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2085">
								<figDesc>Page 082.</figDesc>
							</figure> soaked in by many sore and amazing circumstances. And it is a
							matter of soul-abasement to all that are in the bond of God's holy
							covenant in this place, that Satan's seat should be amongst them, where
							he attempts to set up his kingdom in opposition to Christ's kingdom, and
							to take some of the visible subjects of our Lord Jesus, and use at least
							their shapes and appearances, instrumentally, to afflict and torture
							other visible subjects of the same kingdom. Surely his design is that
							Christ's kingdom may be divided against itself, that, being thereby
							weakened, he may the better take opportunity to set up his own accursed
							powers and dominions. It calls aloud then to all in this place in the
							name of the blessed Jesus, and words of his holy apostle (1 Peter v. 6),
							`Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.'</p>
						<p>“It is matter of terror, amazement, and astonishment, to all such
							wretched souls (if there be any here in the congregation; and God, of
							his infinite mercy, grant that none of you may ever be found such!) as
							have given up their names and souls to the Devil; who by covenant,
							explicit or implicit, have bound themselves to be his slaves and
							drudges, consenting to be instruments in whose shapes he may torment and
							afflict their fellow-creatures (even of their own kind) to the amazing
							and astonishing of the standers-by. I would hope I might have spared
							this use, but I desire (by divine assistance) to declare the whole
							counsel of God; and if it come not as conviction where it is so, it may
							serve for warning, that it may never be so. For it is a most dreadful
							thing to consider that any should change the service of God for the

								<pb n="083" id="vII083"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2086">
								<figDesc>Page 083.</figDesc>
							</figure> God should break that covenant, and make a league with Satan;
							if any that have sat down and eat at Christ's Table, should so lift up
							their heel against him as to have fellowship at the table of devils, and
							(as it hath been represented to some of the afflicted) eat of the bread
							and drink of the wine that Satan hath mingled. Surely, if this be so,
							the poet is in the right, “Audax omnia perpeti. Gens humana ruit per
							vetitum nefas:” audacious mortals are grown to a fearful height of
							impiety; and we must cry out in Scripture language, and that emphatical
							apostrophe of the Prophet Jeremy (chap. ii. 12), `Be astonished, O ye
							heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid: be ye very desolate, saith the
							Lord.' ... If you are in convenant with the Devil, the intercession of
							the blessed Jesus is against you. His prayer is for the subduing of
							Satan's power and kingdom, and the utter eonfounding of all his
							instruments. If it be so, then the great God is set against you. The
							omnipotent Jehovah, one God in three Persons; Father, Son, and Holy
							Ghost, in their several distinct operations and all their divine
							attributes, — are engaged against you. Therefore KNOW YE that are guilty
							of such monstrons iniquity, that He that made you will not save you, and
							that He that formed you will show you no favor (Isa. xxvii. 11). Be
							assured, that, although you should now evade the condemnation of man's
							judgment, and escape a violent death by the hand of justice; yet, unless
							God shall give you repentance (which we heartily pray for), there is a
							day coming when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed by Jesus
							Christ (Rom. ii. 16). Then, then, your sin will find you out; and you
							shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
							Lord, and doomed to those endless, easeless, and remediless torments
							prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. xxv. 41).... If you <pb
								n="084" id="vII084"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2087">
								<figDesc>Page 084.</figDesc>
							</figure> have been guilty of such impiety, the prayers of the people of
							God are against you on that account. It is their duty to pray daily,
							that Satan's kingdom may be suppressed, weakened, brought down, and at
							last totally destroyed; hence that all abettors, subjects, defenders,
							and promoters thereof, may be utterly crushed and confounded. They are
							constrained to suppress that kindness and compassion that in their
							sacred addresses they once bare unto you (as those of their own kind,
							and framed out of the same mould), praying with one consent, as the
							royal prophet did against his malicious enemies, the instruments of
							Satan (Ps. cix. 6), `Set thou a wicked man over him, and let Satan stand
							at his right hand' (i.e.), to withstand all that is for his good, and
							promote all that is for his hurt; and (verse 7) `When he is judged, let
							him be condemned, and let his prayer become sin.'</p>
						<p>“Be we exhorted and directed to exercise true spiritual sympathy with,
							and compassion towards, those poor, afflicted persons that are by divine
							permission under the direful influence of Satan's malice. There is a
							divine precept enjoining the practice of such duty: Heb. xiii. 3,
							`Remember them that suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the
							body.' Let us, then, be deeply sensible, and, as the elect of God, put
							on bowels of mercy towards those in misery (Col. iii. 12). Oh, pity,
							pity them! for the hand of the Lord hath touched them, and the malice of
							devils hath fallen upon them.</p>
						<p>“Let us be sure to take unto us and put on the whole armor of God, and
							every piece of it; let none be wanting. Let us labor to be in the

							alarm unto you: <hi rend="smallcaps">Arm, arm, arm!</hi> handle your

							under the Captain of our salvation, that, by the shield of faith, ye and
							we all may resist the fiery darts of the wicked; and may be faithful
							unto death in our spiritual warfare; so shall we assuredly receive the
							crown of life (Rev. ii. 10). Let us admit no parley, give no quarter:
							let none of Satan's forces or furies be more vigilant to hurt us than we
							are to resist and repress them, in the name, and by the spirit, grace,
							and strength of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us play the throne of grace,
							in the name and merit of our Blessed Mediator, taking all possible
							opportunities, public, private, and secret, to pour out our
							supplications to the God of our salvation. Prayer is the most proper and
							potent antidote against the old Serpent's venomous operations. When
							legions of devils do come down among us, multitudes of prayers should go
							up to God. Satan, the worst of all our enemies, is called in Scripture a
							dragon, to note his malice; a serpent, to note his subtilty; a lion, to
							note his strength. But none of all these can stand before prayer. The
							most inveterate malice (as that of Haman) sinks under the prayer of
							Esther (chap. iv. 16). The deepest policy (the counsel of Achitophel)
							withers before the prayer of David (2 Sam. xv. 31); and the vastest army
							(an host of a thousand thousand Ethiopians) ran away, like so many
							cowards, before the prayer of Asa (2 Chron. xiv. 9 to 15).</p>

							offer one word to your consideration. Do all that in you lies to check
							and rebuke Satan; endeavoring, by all ways and means that are according
							to the rule of God, to discover his instruments in these horrid
							operations. You are concerned in the civil government of this people,
							being invested with power by their Sacred Majesties, under this glorious
							Jesus (the King and Governor of his church), for the supporting of
							Christ's kingdom against all oppositions of Satan's kingdom and his
							instruments. Being ordained of God to such a station (Rom. xiii. 1), we
							entreat you, bear not the sword in vain, as ver. 4; but approve
							yourselves a terror of and punishment to evil-doers, and a praise to
							them that do well (1 Peter ii. 14); ever remembering that ye judge not
							for men, but for the Lord (2 Chron. xix. 6); and, as his promise is, so
							our prayer shall be for you, without ceasing, that he would be with you
							in the judgment, as he that can and will direct, assist, and reward you.
							Follow the example of the upright Job (chap. xxix. 16): Be a father to
							the poor; to these poor afflicted persons, in pitiful and painful
							endeavors to help them; and the cause that seems to be so dark, as you
							know not how to determine it, do your utmost, in the use of all regular
							means, to search it out.</p>
						<p>“There is comfort in considering that the Lord Jesus, the Captain of our
							salvation, hath already overcome the Devil. Christ, that blessed seed of
							the woman, hath given this cursed old serpent called the Devil. and
							Satan a mortal and incurable bruise on the head (Gen. iii. 15). He was
							too much for him in a single conflict (Matt. iv.). He opposed his power
							and kingdom in the possessed. He suffered not the devils to speak,
							because they knew him (Mark i. 34). He completed <pb n="087" id="vII087"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2092">
								<figDesc>Page 087.</figDesc>
							</figure> his victory by his death on the cross, and destroyed his
							dominion (Heb. ii. 14), that through death he might destroy death, and
							him that had the powers of death, that is the Devil; and by and after
							his resurrection made show openly unto the world, that he had spoiled
							principalities and powers, triumphing over them (Col. ii. 15). Hence, if
							we are by faith united to him, his victory is an earnest and prelibation
							of our conquest at last. All Satan's strugglings now are but those of a
							conquered enemy. It is no small comfort to consider, that Job's exercise
							of patience had its beginning from the Devil; but we have seen the end
							to be from the Lord (James v. 11). That we also may find by experience
							the same blessed issue of our present distresses by Satan's malice, let
							us repent of every sin that hath been committed, and labor to practise
							every duty which hath been neglected. Then we shall assuredly and
							speedily find that the kingly power of our Lord and Saviour shall be
							magnified, in delivering his poor sheep and lambs out of the jaws and
							paws of the roaring lion.”</p>

					<p>These extended extracts are given from Lawson's discourse, partly to enable
						every one to estimate the effect it must have produced, under the
						circumstances of the occasion, but mainly because they present a living
						picture of the sentiments, notions, modes of thinking and reasoning, and
						convictions, then prevalent. No description given by a person looking back
						from our point of view, not having experienced the delusions of that age, no
						matter who might attempt the task, could adequately paint the scene. The
						foregoing extracts show better, I think, than any documents that have come
						down to us, how the subject lay <pb n="088" id="vII088"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2093">
							<figDesc>Page 088.</figDesc>
						</figure> in the minds of men at that time. They bring before us directly,
						without the intervention of any secondary agency, the thoughts,
						associations, sentiments, of that generation, in breathing reality. They
						carry us back to the hour and to the spot. Deodat Lawson rises from his
						unknown grave, comes forth from the impenetrable cloud which enveloped the
						closing scenes of his mortal career, and we listen to his voice, as it spoke
						to the multitudes that gathered in and around the meeting in Salem Village,
						on Lecture-day, March 24, 1692. He lays bare his whole mind to our immediate
						inspection. In and through him, we behold the mind and heart, the forms of
						language and thought, the feelings and passions, of the people of that day.
						We mingle with the crowd that hang upon his lips; we behold their
						countenances, discern the passions that glowed upon their features, and
						enter into the excitement that moved and tossed them like a tempest. We are
						thus prepared, as we could be in no other way, to comprehend our story.</p>
					<p>The sermon answered its end. It re-enforced the powers that had begun their
						work. It spread out the whole doctrine of witchcraft in a methodical,
						elaborate, and most impressive form. It justified and commended every thing
						that had been done, and every thing that remained to be done; every step in
						the proceedings; every process in the examinations; every kind of accusation
						and evidence that had been adduced; every phase of the popular belief,
						however wild and monstrous; every pretension of the afflicted children <pb
							n="089" id="vII089"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2094">
							<figDesc>Page 089.</figDesc>
						</figure> to preternatural experiences and communications, and every tale of
						apparitions of departed spirits and the ghosts of murdered men, women, and
						children, which, engendered in morbid and maniac imaginations, had been
						employed to fill him and others with horror, inspire revenge, and drive on
						the general delirium. And it fortified every point by the law and the
						testimony, by passages and scraps of Scripture, studiously and skilfully
						culled out, and ingeniously applied. It gave form to what had been vague,
						and authority to what had floated in blind and baseless dreams of fancy. It
						crystallized the disordered vagaries, that had been seething in turbulent
						confusion in the public mind, into a fixed, organized, and permanent
						shape.</p>
					<p>Its publication was forthwith called for. The manuscript was submitted to
						Increase and Cotton Mather of the North, James Allen and John Bailey of the
						First, Samuel Willard of the Old South, churches in Boston, and Charles
						Morton of the church in Charlestown. It was printed with a strong,
						unqualified indorsement of approval, signed by the names severally of these
						the most eminent divines of the country. The discourse was dedicated to the
						“worshipful and worthily honored Bartholomew Gedney, John Hathorne, Jonathan
						Corwin, Esqrs., together with the reverend Mr. John Higginson, pastor, and
						Mr. Nicholas Noyes, teacher, of the Church of Christ at Salem,” with a
						preface, addressed to all his “Christian friends and acquaintance, the
						inhabitants of Salem Village.” It was republished in London in 1704, under
						the immediate direction of its <pb n="090" id="vII090"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2095">
							<figDesc>Page 090.</figDesc>
						</figure> author. The subject is described as “Christ's Fidelity, the only
						Shield against Satan's Malignity;” and the titlepage is enforced by passages
						of Scripture (Rev. xii. 12, and Rom. xvi. 20). The interest of the volume is
						highly increased by an appendix, giving the substance of notes taken by
						Lawson on the spot, during the examinations and trials. They are invaluable,
						as proceeding from a chief actor in the scenes, who was wholly carried away
						by the delusion. They describe, in marvellous colors, the wonderful
						manifestations of diabolical agency in, upon, and through the afflicted
						children; resembling, in many respects, reports of spiritual communications
						prevalent in our day, although not quite coming up to them. These
						statements, and the preface to the discourse, are given in the Appendix to
						this volume. In a much briefer form, it was printed by Benjamin Harris, at
						Boston, in 1692; and soon after by John Dunton, in London.</p>
					<p>Before dismissing Mr. Lawson's famous sermon, our attention is demanded to a
						remarkable paragraph in it. His strong faculties could not be wholly bereft
						of reason; and he had sense enough left to see, what does not appear to have
						occurred to others, that there might be a re-action in the popular passions,
						and that some might be called to account by an indignant public, if not
						before a stern tribunal of justice, for the course of cruelty and outrage
						they were pursuing, with so high a hand, against accused persons. He was not
						entirely satisfied that the appeal he made in his discourse to <pb n="091"
							id="vII091"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2096">
							<figDesc>Page 091.</figDesc>
						</figure> the people to suppress and crush out all vestiges of human
						feeling, and to stifle compassion and pity in their breasts, would prevail.
						He foresaw that the friends and families of innocent and murdered victims
						might one day call for vengeance; and he attempts to provide, beforehand, a
						defence that is truly ingenious: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Give no place to the Devil by rash censuring of others, without
							sufficient grounds, or false accusing any willingly. This is indeed to
							be like the Devil, who hath the title, <unclear/>, in the Greek, because
							he is the calumniator or false accuser. Hence, when we read of such
							accusers in the latter days, they are, in the original, called
							<unclear/>, <hi rend="italics">calumniatores</hi> (2 Tim. iii. 3). It is
							a time of temptation amongst you, such as never was before: let me
							entreat you not to be lavish or severe in reflecting on the malice or
							envy of your neighbors, by whom any of you have been accused, lest,
							whilst you falsely charge one another, — viz., the relations of the
							afflicted and relations of the accused, — the grand accuser (who loves
							to fish in troubled waters) should take advantage upon you. Look at sin,
							the procuring cause; God in justice, the sovereign efficient; and Satan,
							the enemy, the principal instrument, both in afflicting some and
							accusing others. And, if innocent persons be suspected, it is to be
							ascribed to God's pleasure, supremely permitting, and Satan's malice
							subordinately troubling, by representation of such to the afflicting of
							others, even of such as have, all the while, we have reason to believe
							(especially some of them), no kind of ill-will or disrespect unto those
							that have been complained of by them. This giving place to the Devil
							avoid; for it will have uncomfortable <pb n="092" id="vII092"/>

							we heartily pray God, in mercy, to prevent.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>This artifice of statement, speciously covered, — while it outrages every
						sentiment of natural justice, and breaks every bond of social
						responsibility, — is found, upon close inspection, to be a shocking
						imputation against the divine administration. It represents the Deity, under
						the phrases “sovereign efficient” and “supremely permitting” in a view which
						affords equal shelter to every other class of criminals, even of the deepest
						dye, as well as those who were ready and eager to bring upon their neighbors
						the charge of confederacy with Satan.</p>
					<p>The next Sunday — March 27 — was the regular communion-day of the village
						church; and Mr. Parris prepared duly to improve the occasion to advance the
						movement then so strongly under way, and to deepen still more the impression
						made by the events of the week, especially by Mr. Lawson's sermon. He
						accordingly composed an elaborate and effective discourse of his own; and a
						scene was arranged to follow the regular service, which could not but
						produce important results. An unexpected occurrence — a part not in the
						programme — took place, which created a sensation for the moment; but it
						tended, upon the whole, to heighten the public excitement, and, without much
						disturbing the order, only precipitated a little the progress of events.</p>

						<figure id="Uphv2098">

						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>It may well be supposed, that the congregation assembled that day with minds
						awfully solemnized, and altogether in a condition to be deeply affected by
						the services. A respectable person always prominently noticeable for her
						devout participation in the worship of the sanctuary, and a member of the
						church, had, on Monday, after a public examination, been committed to
						prison, and was there in irons, waiting to be tried for her life for the
						blackest of crimes, — a confederacy with the enemy of the souls of men, the
						archtraitor and rebel against the throne of God. On Thursday, another
						venerable, and ever before considered pious, matron of a large and
						influential family, a participant in their worship, and a member of the
						mother-church, had been consigned to the same fate, to be tried for the same
						horrible crime. A little child had been proved to have also joined in the
						infernal league. No one could tell to what extent Satan had lengthened his
						chain, or who, whether old or young, were in league with him. Every soul was
						still alive to the impressions made by Mr. Lawson's great discourse, and by
						the throngs of excited people, including magistrates and ministers, that had
						been gathered in the village.</p>
					<p>The character and spirit of Mr. Parris's sermon are indicated in a prefatory
						note in the manuscript, “occasioned by dreadful witchcraft broke out here a
						few weeks past; and one member of this church, and another of Salem, upon
						public examination by civil authority, vehemently suspected for
						she-witches.” The running <pb n="094" id="vII094"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2099">
							<figDesc>Page 094.</figDesc>
						</figure> title is, “Christ knows how many devils there are in his church,
						and who they are;” and the text is John vi. 70, 71, “Jesus answered them,
						Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of Judas
						Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he it was that should betray him, being one
						of the twelve.”</p>
					<p>Peter Cloyse was born May 27, 1639. He came to Salem from York, in Maine, and
						was one of the original members of the village church. He appears to have
						been a person of the greatest respectability and strength of character. He
						married Sarah, sister of Rebecca Nurse, and widow of Edmund Bridges. She was
						admitted to the village church, Jan. 12, 1690, being then about forty-eight
						years of age. It may well be supposed that she and her family were
						overwhelmed with affliction and horror by the proceedings against her
						sister. But, as she and her husband were both communicants, and it was
						sacrament-day, it was thought best for them to summon resolution to attend
						the service. After much persuasion, she was induced to go. She was a very
						sensitive person, and it must have required a great effort of fortitude. Her
						mind was undoubtedly much harrowed by the allusions made to the events of
						the week; and, when Mr. Parris announced his text, and opened his discourse
						in the spirit his language indicates, she could bear it no longer, but rose,
						and left the meeting. A fresh wind blowing at the time caused the door to
						slam after her. The congregation was probably startled; but Parris was not
						long embarrassed by the interruption, and <pb n="095" id="vII095"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2100">
							<figDesc>Page 095.</figDesc>
						</figure> she was attended to in due season. At the close of the service,
						the following scene occurred. I give it as Parris describes it in his
						church-record book: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“After the common auditory was dismissed, and before the church's
							communion at the Lord's Table, the following testimony against the error
							of our Sister Mary Sibley, who had given direction to my Indian man in
							an unwarrantable way to find out witches, was read by the pastor: —</p>
						<p>“It is altogether undeniable that our great and blessed God, for wise and
							holy ends, hath suffered many persons, in several families, of this
							little village, to be grievously vexed and tortured in body, and to be
							deeply tempted, to the endangering of the destruction of their souls;
							and all these amazing feats (well known to many of us) to be done by
							witchcraft and diabolical operations. It is also well known, that, when
							these calamities first began, which was in my own family, the affliction
							was several weeks before such hellish operations as witchcraft were
							suspected. Nay, it was not brought forth to any considerable light,
							until diabolical means were used by the making of a cake by my Indian
							man, who had his direction from this our sister, Mary Sibley; since
							which, apparitions have been plenty, and exceeding much mischief hath
							followed. But, by these means (it seems), the Devil hath been raised
							amongst us, and his rage is vehement and terrible; and, when he shall be
							silenced, the Lord only knows. But now that this our sister should be
							instrumental to such distress is a great grief to myself, and our godly
							honored and reverend neighbors, who have had the knowledge of it.
							Nevertheless, I do truly hope and believe, that this our sister doth
							truly <pb n="096" id="vII096"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2101">
								<figDesc>Page 096.</figDesc>
							</figure> fear the Lord; and I am well satisfied from her, that, what
							she did, she did it ignorantly, from what she had heard of this nature
							from other ignorant or worse persons. Yet we are in duty bound to
							protest against such actions, as being indeed a going to the Devil for
							help against the Devil: we having no such directions from nature, or
							God's word, it must therefore be, and is, accounted, by godly
							Protestants who write or speak of such matters, as diabolical; and
							therefore calls this our sister to deep humiliation for what she has
							done, and all of us to be watchful against Satan's wiles and
							devices.</p>
						<p>“Therefore, as we, in duty as a church of Christ, are deeply bound to
							protest against it, as most directly contrary to the gospel, yet,
							inasmuch as this our sister did it in ignorance as she professeth and we
							believe, we can continue her in our holy fellowship, upon her serious
							promise of future better advisedness and caution, and acknowledging that
							she is indeed sorrowful for her rashness herein.</p>
						<p>“Brethren, if this be your mind, that this iniquity should be thus borne
							witness against, manifest it by your usual sign of lifting up your
							hands. — The brethren voted generally, or universally: none made any
							exceptions.</p>
						<p>“Sister Sibley, if you are convinced that you herein did sinfully, and
							are sorry for it, let us hear it from your own mouth. — She did manifest
							to satisfaction her error and grief for it.</p>
						<p>“Brethren, if herein you have received satisfaction, testify it by
							lifting up your hands. — A general vote passed; no exception made.</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Note.</hi> — 25th March, 1692. I discoursed said

							<figure id="Uphv2102">

							</figure> church; and said Sister Sibley assented to the same with tears
							and sorrowful confession.'</p>
					</q>
					<p>This proceeding was of more importance than appears, perhaps, at first view.
						It was one of Mr. Parris most skilful moves. The course pursued by the
						“afflicted” persons had, thus far, in reference to those engaged in the
						prosecutions, been in the right direction. But it was manifest, after the
						exhibitions they had given, that they wielded a fearful power, too fearful
						to be left without control. They could cry out upon whomsoever they pleased;
						and against their accusations, armed as they were with the power to fix the
						charge of guilt upon any one by giving ocular demonstration that he or she
						was the author of their sufferings, there could be no defence. They might
						turn, at any moment, and cry out upon Parris or Lawson, or either or both of
						the deacons. Nothing could withstand the evidence of their fits,
						convulsions, and tortures. It was necessary to have and keep them under safe
						control, and, to this end, to prevent any outsiders, or any injudicious or
						intermeddling people, from holding intimacy with them. Parris saw this, and,
						with his characteristic boldness of action and fertility of resources, at
						once put a stop to all trouble, and closed the door against danger, from
						this quarter.</p>
					<p>Samuel Sibley was a member of the church, and a near neighbor of Mr. Parris.
						He was about thirty years of age. His wife Mary was thirty-two years of age,
						and also a member of the church. They <pb n="098" id="vII098"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2103">
							<figDesc>Page 098.</figDesc>
						</figure> were persons of respectable standing and good repute. Nothing is
						known to her disadvantage, but her foolish connection with the mystical
						operations going on in Mr. Parris's family; and of this she was heartily
						ashamed. Her penitent sensibility is quite touchingly described by Mr.
						Parris. It is true that what she had done was a trifle in comparison with
						what was going on every day in the families of Mr. Parris and Thomas Putnam:
						but she had acted “rashly,” without “advisedness” from the right quarter,
						under the lead of “ignorant persons;” and therefore it was necessary to make
						a great ado about it, and hold her up as a warning to prevent other persons
						from meddling in such matters. Her husband was an uncle of Mary Walcot, one
						of the afflicted children; and it was particularly important to keep their
						relatives, and members of their immediate families, from taking any part or
						action in connection with them, except under due “advisedness,” and the
						direction of persons learned in such deep matters. The family connections of
						the Sibleys were extensive, and a blow struck at that point would be felt
						everywhere. The procedure was undoubtedly effectual. After Mary Sibley had
						been thus awfully rebuked and distressingly exposed for dealing with “John
						Indian,” it is not likely that any one else ever ventured to intermeddle
						with the “afflicted,” or have any connection, except as outside spectators,
						with the marvellous phenomena of “diabolical operations.” It will be
						noticed, that, while Mr. Parris thus waved the sword of disciplinary <pb
							n="099" id="vII099"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2104">
							<figDesc>Page 099.</figDesc>

						<p>It is to be observed, that there was, at this time, a break in the
							regular government of Massachusetts. In the spring of 1689, the people
							had risen, seized the royal governor, Sir Edmund Andros, and put him in
							prison. They summoned their old charter governor, Simon Bradstreet, then
							living in Salem, eighty-seven years of age, to the chair of state;
							called the assistants of 1686 back to their seats, who provided for an
							election of representatives by the people of the towns; and the
							government thus created conducted affairs until the arrival of Sir
							William Phipps, in May, 1692, when Massachusetts ceased to be a <pb
								n="100" id="vII100"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2105">
								<figDesc>Page 100.</figDesc>
							</figure> colony, and was thenceforth, until 1774, a royal prov
							<unclear/>. During these three years, from May, 1689, to May, 1692, the
							government was based upon an uprising of the people. It was a period of
							pure and absolute independence of the crown or parliament of England.
							Although Bradstreet's faculties were unimpaired and his spirit true and
							firm, his age prevented his doing much more than to give his loved and
							venerated name to the daring movement, and to the official service, of
							the people. The executive functions were, for the most part, exercised
							by the deputy, Thomas Danforth, who was a person of great ability and
							public spirit. Unfortunately, at this time he was zealously in favor of
							the witchcraft prosecutions. Bradstreet was throughout opposed to them.
							Had time held off its hand, and his physical energies not been impaired,
							he would undoubtedly have resisted and prevented them. Danforth, it is
							said by Brattle, came to disapprove of them finally: but he began them
							by arrests in other towns, months before any thing of the kind was
							thought of in Salem Village; and he contributed, prominently, to give
							destructive and wide-spread power, in an early stage of its development,
							to the witchcraft delusion here.</p>
						<p>After the lapse of a week, preparations were completed to renew
							operations, and a higher and more commanding character given to them. On
							Monday, April 4, Captain Jonathan Walcot and Lieutenant Nathaniel
							Ingersoll went to the town, and, “for themselves and several of their
							neighbors,” exhibited to the assistants <pb n="101" id="vII101"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2106">
								<figDesc>Page 101.</figDesc>
							</figure> residing there, John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, complaints
							against “Sarah Cloyse, the wife of Peter Cloyse of Salem Village, and
							Elizabeth Procter of Salem Farms, for high suspicion of sundry acts of
							witchcraft.” There the plan of proceedings in reference to the
							above-said parties was agreed upon. It was the result of consultation;
							communications probably passing with the deputy-governor in Boston, or
							at his residence in Cambridge. On the 8th of April, warrants were duly
							issued, ordering the marshal to bring in the prisoners “on Monday
							morning next, being the eleventh day of this instant April, about eleven
							of the clock, in the public meeting-house in the town.” It had been
							arranged, that the examination should not be, as before, in the ordinary
							way, before the two local magistrates, but, in an extraordinary way,
							before the highest tribunal in the colony, or a representation of it.
							For a preliminary hearing, with a view merely to commitment for trial,
							this surely may justly be characterized as an extraordinary, wholly
							irregular, and, in all points of view, reprehensible procedure. When the
							day came, the meeting-house, which was much more capacious than that at
							the village, was crowded; and the old town filled with excited throngs.
							Upon opening proceedings, lo and behold, instead of the two magistrates,
							the government of the colony was present, in the highest character it
							then had as “a council”! The record says, —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Salem, April 11, 1692. — At a Council held at Salem, and present
								Thomas Danforth, Esq., deputy-governor; <pb n="102" id="vII102"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2107">
									<figDesc>Page 102.</figDesc>
								</figure> James Russell, John Hathorne, Isaac Addington, Major
								Samuel Appleton, Captain Samuel Sewall, Jonathan Corwin,
								Esquires.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Russell was of Charlestown, Addington and Sewall of Boston, and Appleton
							of Ipswich. Mr. Parris, “being desired and appointed to write the
							examination, did take the same, and also read it before the council in
							public.” This document has not come down to us; but Hutchinson had
							access to it, and the substance of it is preserved in his “History of
							Massachusetts.”</p>
						<p>The marshal (Herrick) brought in Sarah Cloyse and Elizabeth Procter, and
							delivered them “before the honorable council:” and the examination was
							begun.</p>
						<p>The deputy-governor first called to the stand John Indian, and plied him,
							as was the course pursued on all these occasions, with leading
							questions: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“John, who hurt you? — Goody Procter first, and then Goody
								Cloyse.</p>
							<p>“What did she do to you? — She brought the book to me.</p>
							<p>“John, tell the truth: who hurts you? Have you been hurt? — The first
								was a gentlewoman I saw.</p>
							<p>“Who next? — Goody Cloyse.</p>
							<p>“But who hurt you next? — Goody Procter.</p>
							<p>“What did she do to you? — She choked me, and brought the book.</p>
							<p>“How oft did she come to torment you? — A good many times, she and
								Goody Cloyse.</p>
							<pb n="103" id="vII103"/>
							<p>
								<figure id="Uphv2108">
									<figDesc>Page 103.</figDesc>
								</figure>
							</p>
							<p>“Do they come to you in the night, as well as the day? — They come
								most in the day.</p>
							<p>“Who? — Goody Cloyse and Goody Procter.</p>
							<p>“Where did she take hold of you? — Upon my throat, to stop my
								breath.</p>
							<p>“Do you know Goody Cloyse and Goody Procter? — Yes: here is Goody
								Cloyse.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>We may well suppose that these two respectable women must have been
							filled with indignation, shocked, and amazed at the statements made by
							the Indian, following the leading interrogatories of the Court. Sarah
							Cloyse broke out, “When did I hurt thee?” He answered, “A great many
							times.” She exclaimed, “Oh, you are a grievous liar!” The Court
							proceeded with their questions: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“What did this Goody Cloyse do to you? — She pinched and bit me till
								the blood came.</p>
							<p>“How long since this woman came and hurt you? — Yesterday, at
								meeting.</p>
							<p>“At any time before? — Yes: a great many times.”</p>
							<p>Having drawn out John Indian, the Court turned to the other afflicted
								ones: —</p>
							<p>“Mary Walcot, who hurts you? — Goody Cloyse.</p>
							<p>“What did she do to you? — She hurt me.</p>
							<p>“Did she bring the book? — Yes.</p>
							<p>“What was you to do with it? — To touch it, and be well.</p>
							<p>“(Then she fell into a fit.)”</p>
						</q>
						<p>This put a stop to the examination for a time; but it was generally quite
							easy to bring witnesses out of a <pb n="104" id="vII104"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2109">
								<figDesc>Page 104.</figDesc>
							</figure> fit, and restore entire calmness of mind. All that was
							necessary was to lift them up, and carry them to the accused person, the
							touch of any part of whose body would, in an instant, relieve the
							sufferer. This having been done, the examination proceeded: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Doth she come alone? — Sometimes alone, and sometimes in company
								with Goody Nurse and Goody Corey, and a great many I do not
								know.</p>
							<p>“(Then she fell into a fit again.)”</p>
						</q>
						<p>She was, probably, restored in the same way as before; but, her part
							being finished for that stage of the proceeding, another of the
							afflicted children took the stand: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Abigail Williams, did you see a company at Mr. Parris house eat and
								drink? — Yes, sir: that was in the sacrament.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>I would call attention to the form of the foregoing questions. Hutchinson
							says that “Mr. Parris was over-officious: most of the examinations,
							although in the presence of one or more magistrates, were taken by him.”
							He put the questions. They show, on this occasion, a minute knowledge
							beforehand of what the witnesses are to say, which it cannot be supposed
							Danforth, Russell, Addington, Appleton, and Sewall, strangers, as they
							were, to the place and the details of the affair, could have had. The
							examination proceeded: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“How many were there? — About forty, and Goody Cloyse and Goody Good
								were their deacons.</p>
							<pb n="105" id="vII105"/>
							<p>
								<figure id="Uphv2110">
									<figDesc>Page 105.</figDesc>
								</figure>
							</p>
							<p>“What was it? — They said it was our blood, and they had it twice
								that day.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>The interrogator again turned to Mary Walcot, and inquired, —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Have you seen a white man? — Yes, sir: a great many times.</p>
							<p>“What sort of a man was he? — A fine grave man; and, when he came, he
								made all the witches to tremble.</p>
							<p>“(Abigail Williams confirmed the same, and that they had such a sight
								at Deacon Ingersoll's.)</p>
							<p>“Who was at Deacon Ingersoll's then? — Goody Cloyse, Goody Nurse,
								Goody Corey, and Goody Good.</p>
							<p>“(Then Sarah Cloyse asked for water, and sat down, as one seized with
								a dying, fainting fit; and several of the afflicted fell into fits,
								and some of them cried out, `Oh! her spirit has gone to prison to
								her sister Nurse.')”</p>
						</q>
						<p>The audacious lying of the witnesses; the horrid monstrousness of their
							charges against Sarah Cloyse, of having bitten the flesh of the Indian
							brute, and drank herself and distributed to others, as deacon, at an
							infernal sacrament, the blood of the wicked creatures making these foul
							and devilish declarations, known by her to be utterly and wickedly
							false; and the fact that they were believed by the deputy, the council,
							and the assembly, — were more than she could bear. Her soul sickened at
							such unimaginable depravity and wrong; her nervous system gave way; she
							fainted, and sunk to the floor. The manner in which the girls turned the
							incident against her shows how they were hardened to all human feeling,
							and the <pb n="106" id="vII106"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2111">
								<figDesc>Page 106.</figDesc>
							</figure> cunning art which, on all occasions, characterized their
							proceedings. That such an insolent interruption and disturbance, on
							their part, was permitted, without rebuke from the Court, is a perpetual
							dishonor to every member of it. The scene exhibited at this moment, in
							the meeting-house, is worthy of an attempt to imagine. The most terrible
							sensation was naturally produced, by the swooning of the prisoner, the
							loudly uttered and savage mockery of the girls, and their going
							simultaneously into fits, screaming at the top of their voices, twisting
							into all possible attitudes, stiffened as in death, or gasping with
							convulsive spasms of agony, and crying out, at intervals, “There is the
							black man whispering in Cloyse's ear,” “There is a yellow flying round
							her head.” John Indian, on such occasions, used to confine his
							achievements to tumbling, and rolling his ugly body about the floor. The
							deepest commiseration was felt by all for the “afflicted,” and men and
							women rushed to hold and soothe them. There was, no doubt, much loud
							screeching, and some miscellaneous faintings, through the whole crowd.
							At length, by bringing the sufferers into contact with Goody Cloyse, the
							diabolical fluid passed back into her, they were all relieved, and the
							examination was resumed. Elizabeth Procter was now brought forward.</p>
						<p>In the account given, in the First Part, of the population of Salem
							Village and the contiguous farms, her husband, John Procter, was
							introduced to our acquaintance. From what we then saw of him, we are
							well assured that he would not shrink from the protection <pb n="107"
								id="vII107"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2112">
								<figDesc>Page 107.</figDesc>
							</figure> and defence of his wife. He accompanied her from her arrest to
							her arraignment, and stood by her side, a strong, brave, and resolute
							guardian, trying to support her under the terrible trials of her
							situation, and ready to comfort and aid her to the extent of his power,
							disregardful of all consequences to himself. The examination proceeded:
							—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Elizabeth Procter, you understand whereof you are charged; viz., to
								be guilty of sundry acts of witchcraft. What say you to it? Speak
								the truth; and so you that are afflicted, you must speak the truth,
								as you will answer it before God another day. Mary Walcot, doth this
								woman hurt you? — I never saw her so as to be hurt by her.</p>
							<p>“Mercy Lewis, does she hurt you?</p>
							<p>“(Her mouth was stopped.)</p>
							<p>“Ann Putnam, does she hurt you?</p>
							<p>“(She could not speak.)</p>
							<p>“Abigail Williams, does she hurt you?</p>
							<p>“(Her hand was thrust in her own mouth.)</p>
							<p>“John, does she hurt you? — This is the woman that came in her shift,
								and choked me.</p>
							<p>“Did she ever bring the book? — Yes, sir.</p>
							<p>“What to do? — To write.</p>
							<p>“What? this woman? — Yes, sir.</p>
							<p>“Are you sure of it? — Yes, sir.</p>
							<p>“(Again Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam were spoke to by the Court;
								but neither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or
								other fits.)</p>
							<p>“What do you say, Goody Procter, to these things? — I take God in
								heaven to be my witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the
								child unborn.</p>
							<pb n="108" id="vII108"/>
							<p>
								<figure id="Uphv2113">
									<figDesc>Page 108.</figDesc>
								</figure>
							</p>
							<p>“Ann Putnam, doth this woman hurt you? — Yes, sir: a great many
								times.</p>
							<p>“(Then the accused looked upon them, and they fell into fits.)</p>
							<p>“She does not bring the book to you, does she? — Yes, sir, often; and
								saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it.</p>
							<p>“Abigail Williams, does this woman hurt you? — Yes, sir, often.</p>
							<p>“Does she bring the book to you? — Yes.</p>
							<p>“What would she have you do with it? — To write in it, and I shall be
								well.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Turning to the accused, Abigail said, “Did not you tell me that your maid
							had written?” Goody Procter seems to have been utterly amazed at the
							conduct and charges of the girls. She knew, of course, that what they
							said was false; but perhaps she thought them crazy, and therefore
							objects of pity and compassion, and felt disposed to treat them kindly,
							and see whether they could not be recalled to their senses, and restored
							to their better nature: for Parris, in his account, says that at this
							point she answered the question thus put to her by Abigail thus: “Dear
							child, it is not so. There is another judgment, dear child.” But
							kindness was thrown away upon them; for Parris says that immediately
							“Abigail and Ann had fits.” After coming out of them, “they cried out,
							`Look you! there is Goody Procter upon the beam.”' Instantly, as we may
							well suppose, the whole audience looked where they pointed. Their manner
							gave assurance that they saw her “on the beam,” among the <pb n="109"
								id="vII109"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2114">
								<figDesc>Page 109.</figDesc>
							</figure> rafters of the meeting-house; but she was invisible to all
							other eyes. The people, no doubt, were filled with amazement at such
							supernaturalism. But John Procter, her husband, did not believe a word
							of it: and it is not to be doubted that he expressed his indignation at
							the nonsense and the outrage in his usual bold, strong, and unguarded
							language, which brought down the vengeance of the girls at once on his
							own head; for Parris, in his report, goes on to say: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“(By and by, both of them cried out of Goodman Procter himself, and
								said he was a wizard. Immediately, many if not all of the bewitched
								had grievous fits.)</p>
							<p>“Ann Putnam, who hurt you? — Goodman Procter, and his wife too.</p>
							<p>“(Afterwards, some of the afflicted cried, `There is Procter going to
								take up Mrs. Pope's feet!' and her feet were immediately taken
								up.)</p>
							<p>“What do you say, Goodman Procter, to these things? — I know not. I
								am innocent.</p>
							<p>“(Abigail Williams cried out, `There is Goodman Procter going to Mrs.
								Pope!' and immediately said Pope fell into a fit.)”</p>
						</q>
						<p>At this point, the deputy, or some member of the Court interposed, if I
							interpret rightly Parris's report, which is here obscurely expressed,
							inasmuch as he does not say who spoke; but the import of the words
							indicates that they proceeded from some member of the Court, who was
							perfectly deceived: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“You see, the Devil will deceive you: the children could see what you
								was going to do before the woman was hurt. <pb n="110" id="vII110"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2115">
									<figDesc>Page 110.</figDesc>
								</figure> I would advise you to repentance, for the Devil is
								bringing you out.</p>
							<p>“(Abigail Williams cried out again, `There is Goodman Procter going
								to hurt Goody Bibber!' and immediately Goody Bibber fell into a fit.
								There was the like of Mary Walcot, and divers others. Benjamin Gould
								gave in his testimony, that he had seen Goodman Corey and his wife,
								Procter and his wife, Goody Cloyse, Goody Nurse, and Goody Griggs in
								his chamber last Thursday night. Elizabeth Hubbard was in a trance
								during the whole examination. During the examination of Elizabeth
								Procter, Abigail Williams and Ann Putnam both made offer to strike
								at said Procter; but, when Abigail's hand came near, it opened, —
								whereas it was made up into a fist before, — and came down exceeding
								lightly as it drew near to said Procter, and at length, with open
								and extended fingers, touched Procter's hood very lightly.
								Immediately, Abigail cried out, her fingers, her fingers, her
								fingers burned; and Ann Putnam took on most grievously of her head,
								and sunk down.)”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Hutchinson, after giving Parris's account of this examination, expresses
							himself thus: “No wonder the whole country was in a consternation, when
							persons of sober lives and unblemished characters were committed to
							prison upon such sort of evidence. Nobody was safe.” All things
							considered, it may perhaps be said, that, filled as the witchcraft
							proceedings were throughout with folly and outrage, there was nothing
							worse than this examination, conducted by the deputy and council, on the
							11th of April, 1692, in the great meeting-house of the First Church in
							Salem. It must have been a scene of the wildest disorder, particularly
								<pb n="111" id="vII111"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2116">
								<figDesc>Page 111.</figDesc>
							</figure> in the latter part of it. No wonder that the people in general
							were deluded, when the most learned councillors of the colony
							countenanced, participated in, and gave effect to, such disorderly
							procedures in a house of worship, in the presence of a high judicial
							tribunal, and of the then supreme government of the colony!</p>
						<p>Benjamin Gould gave his volunteer testimony without “advisedness,” and
							quite incontinently. He brought out Goodman Corey before the managers
							were quite ready to fall upon him; and he antedated, by a considerable
							length of time, any such imputation upon Goody Griggs. It was well for
							Elizabeth Hubbard to have been in a trance, so that she could not hear
							the mention of her aunt's name. The council seems to have adjourned to
							the next day, at the same place, when Mr. Parris “gave further
							information against said John Procter,” which, unfortunately, has not
							come down to us. The result was, that Sarah Cloyse, John Procter, and
							Elizabeth his wife, were all committed for trial, and, with Rebecca
							Nurse, Martha Corey, and Dorcas Good, were sent to the jail in Boston,
							in the custody of Marshal Herrick.</p>
						<p>The proceedings of the 11th and 12th of April produced a great effect in
							driving on the general infatuation. Judge Sewall, who was present as one
							of the council, in his diary at this date, says, “Went to Salem, where,
							in the meeting-house, the persons accused of witchcraft were examined;
							was a very great assembly; 'twas awful to see how the afflicted persons
								<pb n="112" id="vII112"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2117">
								<figDesc>Page 112.</figDesc>
							</figure> were agitated.” In the margin is written, apparently some time
							afterwards, the interjection “<hi rend="italics">Vœ!</hi>” thrice
							repeated, — “Alas, alas, alas!” What perfectly deluded him and Danforth,
							and everybody else, were the exhibitions made by the “afflicted
							children.” This is the grand phenomenon of the witchcraft proceedings
							here in 1692. It, and it alone, carried them through. Those girls, by
							long practice in “the circle,” and day by day, before astonished and
							wondering neighbors gathered to witness their distresses, and especially
							on the more public occasions of the examinations, had acquired
							consummate boldness and tact. In simulation of passions, sufferings, and
							physical affections; in sleight of hand, and in the management of voice
							and feature and attitude, — no necromancers have surpassed them. There
							has seldom been better acting in a theatre than they displayed in the
							presence of the astonished and horror-stricken rulers, magistrates,
							ministers, judges, jurors, spectators, and prisoners. No one seems to
							have dreamed that their actings and sufferings could have been the
							result of cunning or imposture. Deodat Lawson was a man of talents, had
							seen much of the world, and was by no means a simpleton, recluse, or
							novice; but he was wholly deluded by them. The prisoners, although
							conscious of their own innocence, were utterly confounded by the acting
							of the girls. The austere principles of that generation forbade, with
							the utmost severity, all theatrical shows and performances. But at Salem
							Village and the old town, in the respective meeting-houses, and at
							Deacon <pb n="113" id="vII113"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2118">
								<figDesc>Page 113.</figDesc>
							</figure> Nathaniel Ingersoll's, some of the best playing ever got up in
							this country was practised; and patronized, for weeks and months, at the
							very centre and heart of Puritanism, by “the most straitest sect” of
							that solemn order of men. Pastors, deacons, church, doctors of divinity,
							college professors, officers of state, crowded, day after day, to behold
							feats which have never been surpassed on the boards of any theatre;
							which rivalled the most memorable achievements of pantomimists,
							thaumaturgists, and stage-players; and made considerable approaches
							towards the best performances of ancient sorcerers and magicians, or
							modern jugglers and mesmerizers.</p>
						<p>The meeting of the council at Salem, on the 11th of April, 1692, changed
							in one sense the whole character of the transaction. Before, it had been
							a Salem affair. After this, it was a Massachusetts affair. The colonial
							government at Boston had obtruded itself upon the ground, and, of its
							own will and seeking, irregularly, and without call or justification,
							had taken the whole thing out of the hands of the local authorities into
							its own management. Neither the town nor the village of Salem is
							responsible, as a principal actor, for what subsequently took place. To
							that meeting of the deputy-governor and his associates in the colonial
							administration, at an early period of the transaction, the calamities,
							outrages, and shame that followed must in justice be ascribed. Had it
							not taken place, the delusion, as in former instances and other places
							here and in the mother-country, <pb n="114" id="vII114"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2119">
								<figDesc>Page 114.</figDesc>
							</figure> would have remained within its original local limits, and soon
							disappeared. That meeting, and the proceedings then had, gave to the
							fanaticism the momentum that drove it on, and extended its destructive
							influence far and wide.</p>
						<p>The next step in the proceedings is one of the most remarkable features
							in the case. It is, in some points of view, more suggestive of
							suspicion, that there was, behind the whole, a skilful and cunning
							management, ingeniously contriving schemes to mislead the public mind,
							than almost any other part of the transaction. Mary Warren, as has been
							said, was a servant in the family of John Procter. She was a member of
							the “circle” that had so long met at Mr. Parris's house or Thomas
							Putnam's. She was a constant attendant at its meetings, and a leading
							spirit among the girls. She did not take an open part against her master
							or mistress at their examination, although she acted with avidity and
							malignity against them as an accusing witness at their trials, two
							months afterwards. It is to be noticed, that Ann Putnam and Abigail
							Williams, at the examination of Elizabeth Procter, April 11, accused her
							of having induced or compelled “her maid to set her hand to the
							book.”</p>
						<p>On the 18th of April, warrants were got out against Giles Corey and Mary
							Warren, both of Salem Farms; Abigail Hobbs, daughter of William Hobbs,
							of Topsfield; and Bridget Bishop, wife of Edward Bishop, of Salem, — to
							be brought in the next forenoon, at about eight o'clock, at the house of
							Lieutenant Nathaniel <pb n="115" id="vII115"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2120">
								<figDesc>Page 115.</figDesc>
							</figure> Ingersoll, of Salem Village. How Mary Warren became
							transformed from an accuser to an accused, from an afflicted person to
							an afflicter, is the question. It is not easy to fathom the conduct of
							these girls. They appear to have acted upon a plan deliberately formed,
							and to have had an understanding with each other. At the same time,
							occasionally, they had or pretended to have a falling-out, and came into
							contradiction. This was perhaps a mere blind, to prevent the suspicion
							of collusion. The accounts given of Mary Warren seem to render it quite
							certain that she acted with deliberate cunning, and was a guilty
							conspirator with the other accusers in carrying on the plot from the
							beginning. No doubt, it frequently occurred to those concerned in it,
							that suspicions might possibly get into currency that they were acting a
							part in concert. It was necessary, by all means, to guard against such
							an idea. This may be the key to interpret the arrest and proceedings
							against Mary Warren. If it is, the affair, it must be confessed, was
							managed with great shrewdness and skill. She conducted the stratagem
							most dexterously. All at once she fell away from the circle, and began
							to talk against the “afflicted children,” and went so far as to say,
							that they “did but dissemble.” Immediately, they cried out upon her,
							charged her with witchcraft, and had her apprehended. After being
							carried to prison, she spoke in strong language against the proceedings.
							Four persons of unquestionable truthfulness, in prison with her, on the
							same charge, prepared a deposition <pb n="116" id="vII116"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2121">
								<figDesc>Page 116.</figDesc>
							</figure> to this effect: “We heard Mary Warren several times say that
							the magistrates might as well examine Keysar daughter that had been
							distracted many years, and take notice of what she said, as well as any
							of the afflicted persons. `For,' said Mary Warren, `when I was
							afflicted, I thought I saw the apparitions of a hundred persons;' for
							she said her head was distempered that she could not tell what she said.
							And the said Mary told us, that, when she was well again, she could not
							say that she saw any of the apparitions at the time aforesaid.” I will
							now give the substance of her examination, which commenced on the 19th
							of April. Mr. Parris was, as usual, requested to take minutes of the
							proceedings, which have been preserved: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p rend="center">“<hi rend="italics">Examination of Mary Warren, at a
									Court held at Salem Village, by John Hathorne and Jonathan
									Corwin, Esqrs.</hi></p>
							<p>“(As soon as she was coming towards the bar, the afflicted fell into
								fits.)</p>
							<p>“Mary Warren, you stand here charged with sundry acts of witchcraft.
								What do you say for yourself? Are you guilty or not? — I am
								innocent.</p>
							<p>“Hath she hurt you? (Speaking to the sufferers.)</p>
							<p>“(Some were dumb. Betty Hubbard testified against her, and then said
								Hubbard fell into a violent fit.)</p>
							<p>“You were, a little while ago, an afflicted person; now you are an
								afflicter. How comes this to pass? — I look up to God, and take it
								to be a great mercy of God.</p>
							<p>“What! do you take it to be a great mercy to afflict others?</p>
							<p>“(Now they were all but John Indian grievously afflicted, <pb n="117"
									id="vII117"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2122">
									<figDesc>Page 117.</figDesc>
								</figure> and Mrs. Pope also, who was not afflicted before hitherto
								this day; and, after a few moments, John Indian fell into a violent
								fit also.)”</p>
						</q>
						<p>“Well, here” (Mr. Parris, the reporter, goes on to say) “was one that
							just now was a tormenter in her apparition, and she owns that she had
							made a league with the Devil.” The marvel was, that, having before been
							a sufferer, as one of the afflicted accusers, she had then, at that
							moment, appeared in the opposite character, and owned herself to have
							become a confederate with the Evil One. Having established this
							conviction in the minds of the magistrates and spectators, the point was
							reached at which she completed the delusion by appearing to break away
							from her bondage to Satan, assume the functions of a confessing and
							abjuring witch, and retake her place, with tenfold effect, among the
							accusing witnesses. The manner in which she rescued herself from the
							power of Satan exhibits a specimen of acting seldom surpassed. The
							account proceeds thus: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Now Mary Warren fell into a fit, and some of the afflicted cried out
								that she was going to confess; but Goody Corey, and Procter and his
								wife, came in, <hi rend="italics">in their apparition,</hi> and
								struck her down, and said she should tell nothing.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>What is given here in <hi rend="italics">Italics,</hi> as an “<hi
								rend="italics">apparition,</hi>” was of course based upon the
							declarations of the accusing witnesses. It was an art they often
							practised in offering their testimony. They would cry out, that the
							Devil, generally in the shape of a black man, appeared to them at the
							time, whispering in the <pb n="118" id="vII118"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2123">
								<figDesc>Page 118.</figDesc>
							</figure> ear of the accused, or sitting on the beams of the
							meeting-house in which the examinations were generally conducted. On
							this occasion, they declared that three of the persons, then in jail in
							some other place, came in their apparitions, forbade Mary Warren's
							confession, and struck her down. To give full effect to their statement,
							she went through the process of tumbling down. Although nothing was seen
							by any other person present, the deception was perfect. The Rev. Mr.
							Parris wrote it all down as having actually occurred. His record of the
							transaction goes on as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Mary Warren continued a good space in a fit, that she did neither
								see nor hear nor speak.</p>
							<p>“Afterwards she started up, and said, `I will speak,' and cried out,
								`Oh, I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it!' and wringed her hands,
								and fell a little while into a fit again, and then came to speak,
								but immediately her teeth were set; and then she fell into a violent
								fit, and cried out, `O Lord, help me! O good Lord, save me!'</p>
							<p>“And then afterwards cried again, `I will tell, I will tell!' and
								then fell into a dead fit again.</p>
							<p>“And afterwards cried, `I will tell, they did, they did, they did;'
								and then fell into a violent fit again.</p>
							<p>“After a little recovery, she cried, `I will tell, I will tell. They
								brought me to it;' and then fell into a fit again, which fits
								continuing, she was ordered to be led out, and the next to be
								brought in, viz., Bridget Bishop.</p>
							<p>“Some time afterwards, she was called in again, but immediately taken
								with fits for a while.</p>
							<p>“`Have you signed the Devil's book? — No.'</p>
							<pb n="119" id="vII119"/>
							<p>
								<figure id="Uphv2124">
									<figDesc>Page 119.</figDesc>
								</figure>
							</p>
							<p>“`Have you not touched it? — No.'</p>
							<p>“Then she fell into fits again, and was sent forth for air.</p>
							<p>“After a considerable space of time, she was brought in again, but
								could not give account of things by reason of fits, and so sent
								forth.</p>
							<p>“Mary Warren called in afterwards in private, before magistrates and
								ministers.</p>
							<p>“She said, `I shall not speak a word: but I will, I will speak,
								Satan! She saith she will kill me. Oh! she saith she owes me a
								spite, and will claw me off. Avoid Satan, for the name of God,
								avoid!' and then fell into fits again, and cried, `Will ye? I will
								prevent ye, in the name of God.”'</p>
						</q>
						<p>The magistrate inquired earnestly: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“`Tell us how far have you yielded?'</p>
							<p>“A fit interrupts her again.</p>
							<p>“`What did they say you should do, and you should be well?'</p>
							<p>“Then her lips were bit, so that she could not speak: so she was sent
								away.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Mr. Parris, the reporter of the case, adds: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Note that not one of the sufferers was afflicted during her
								examination, after once she began to confess, though they were
								tormented before.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>She was subsequently examined in the prison several times, falling
							occasionally into fits, and exhibiting the appearance of a
							long-continued conflict with Satan, who was supposed to be resisting her
							inclination to confess, and holding her with violence <pb n="120"
								id="vII120"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2125">
								<figDesc>Page 120.</figDesc>
							</figure> to the contract she had made with him. The magistrates and
							ministers beheld with amazement and awe what they believed to be
							precisely a similar scene to that described by the evangelists when the
							Devil strove against the power of the Saviour and his disciples, and
							would not quit his hold upon the young man, but “threw him down, and
							tare him.” At length, as in that case, Satan was overcome. After a
							protracted, most violent, and terrible contest, Mary Warren got released
							from his clutches, and made a full and circumstantial confession.</p>
						<p>Whoever studies carefully the account of Mary Warren's successive
							examinations can hardly question, I think, that she acted a part, and
							acted it with wonderful cunning, skill, and effect.</p>
						<p>This examination, beginning on Tuesday, the 19th of April, continued
							after she was committed to prison in Salem, at the jail there, for
							several days, and was renewed at intervals until the middle of May.
							After she had thoroughly broken away from Satan, she revealed all that
							she had seen and heard while associating with him and his confederate
							subjects: her testimony was implicitly received, and it dealt death and
							destruction in all directions. It is a circumstance strongly confirming
							this view, that Mary Warren was soon released from confinement. It was
							the general practice to keep those, who confessed, in prison, to retain
							in that way power over them, and prevent their recanting their
							confessions. She is found, by the papers on file, to have acted
							afterwards, as a capital witness, <pb n="121" id="vII121"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2126">
								<figDesc>Page 121.</figDesc>
							</figure> against ten persons, all of whom were convicted, and seven
							executed. Besides these, she testified, with the appearance of animosity
							and vindictiveness, against her master John Procter, and her mistress
							his wife; thus contributing to secure the conviction of both, and the
							death of the former. In how many more cases she figured in the same
							character and to the same effect is unknown, as the papers in reference
							to only a very small proportion of them have come down to us. The
							interpretation I give to the course of Mary Warren exhibits her guilt,
							and that of those participating in the stratagem, as of the deepest and
							blackest dye. But it seems to be the only one which a scrutiny of the
							details of her examinations, and of the facts of the case, allows us to
							receive. The effect was most decisive. The course of the accusing
							children in crying out against one of their own number satisfied the
							public, and convinced still more the magistrates, that they were
							truthful, honest, and upright. They had before given evidence that they
							paid no regard to family influence or eminent reputation. They had now
							proved that they had no partiality and no favoritism, but were equally
							ready to bring to light and to justice any of their own circle who might
							fall into the snare of the Evil One, and become confederate with him. No
							dramatic artist, no cunning impostor, ever contrived a more ingenious
							plot; and no actors ever carried one out better than Mary Warren and the
							afflicted children.</p>
						<p>Giles Corey incurred hostility, perhaps, because his <pb n="122"
								id="vII122"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2127">
								<figDesc>Page 122.</figDesc>
							</figure> deposition relating to his wife did not come up to the mark
							required. It is also highly probable, that, though incensed at her
							conduct at the time, reflection had brought him to his senses; and that
							the circumstances of her examination and commitment to prison produced a
							re-action in his mind. If so, he would have been apt to express himself
							very freely. His examination took place April 19th, in the meeting-house
							at the Village. The girls acted their usual part, charging him, one by
							one, with having afflicted them, and proving it on the spot by tortures
							and sufferings. After they had severally got through, they all joined at
							once in their demonstrations. The report made by Parris says, “All the
							afflicted were seized now with fits, and troubled with pinches. Then the
							Court ordered his hands to be tied.” The magistrates lost all control of
							themselves, and flew into a passion, exclaiming, “What! is it not enough
							to act witchcraft at other times, but must you do it now, in face of
							authority?” He seems to have been profoundly affected by the
							marvellousness of the accusations, and the exhibition of what to him was
							inexplicable in the sufferings of the girls; and all he could say was,
							“I am a poor creature, and cannot help it.” — “Upon the motion of his
							head again, they had their heads and necks afflicted.” The magistrates,
							not having recovered their composure, continued to pour their wrath upon
							him, “Why do you tell such wicked lies against witnesses?” — “One of his
							hands was let go, and several were afflicted. He held his head on one
							side, <pb n="123" id="vII123"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2128">
								<figDesc>Page 123.</figDesc>
							</figure> and then the heads of several of the afflicted were held on
							one side. He drew in his cheeks, and the cheeks of some of the afflicted
							were sucked in.” Goody Bibber was on hand, and played her accompaniment.
							She also uttered malignant charges against him, and “was suddenly seized
							with a violent fit.” One of Bibber's statements was that he had called
							her husband “damned devilish rogue.” Through all this outrage, Corey was
							firm in asserting his innocence. His language and manner were serious,
							and solemnized by a sense of the helplessness of his situation and the
							wicked falsehoods heaped upon him. His disagreement with his wife about
							the witchcraft proceedings being well known, the accusers endeavored to
							make it out that they had often quarrelled. But he insisted that the
							only difference which had before existed between them was a conflict of
							opinion on one point. In his family devotions, he used this expression,
							“living to God and dying to sin.” She “found fault” with the language,
							and criticised it. He thought it was all right! The characteristic
							spirit of the old man was roused most strikingly by one of the charges.
							Bibber and others testified that Corey had said he had seen the Devil in
							the shape of a black hog and was very much frightened. He could not
							stand under the imputation of cowardice, and lost sight of every other
							element in the accusation but that. The magistrate asked, “What did you
							see in the cow? Why do you deny it?” — “I saw nothing but my cattle.” —
							“(Divers witnessed that he told <pb n="124" id="vII124"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2129">
								<figDesc>Page 124.</figDesc>
							</figure> them he was frighted.)” — “Well, what do you say to these
							witnesses? What was it frighted you?” — “I do not know that ever I spoke
							the word in my life.”</p>
						<p>But while his character retained its manliness, and his soul was truly
							insensible to fear, he was very much oppressed and distressed by his
							situation. The share he had, with two of his sons-in-law, in bringing
							his wife into her awful condition, and in driving on the public
							infatuation at the beginning, was more than he could endure to think of,
							and he was charged with having meditated suicide. Perhaps he had already
							formed the purpose afterwards carried into effect, and may have dropped
							expressions, under that thought, which to others might appear to
							indicate a design of self. He was accused of having said that “he would
							make away with himself, and charge his death upon his son.” His
							sons-in-law, Crosby and Parker, were acting with the crowd that were
							pursuing him to his death. Little did it enter the imagination of any
							one then, that there was a method by which he could “make away with
							himself,” leaving the entire act of the destruction of his life upon his
							persecutors, and the sin to be apportioned between him and them by the
							All-wise and All-just.</p>
						<p>Abigail Hobbs had been a reckless vagrant creature, wandering through the
							woods at night like a half person; but she had wit enough to see that
							there was safety in confession. She pretended to have committed, by
							witchcraft, crimes enough to have <pb n="125" id="vII125"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2130">
								<figDesc>Page 125.</figDesc>
							</figure> hanged her a dozen times. If she had stood to her confession,
							we should have heard of her no more.</p>
						<p>Bridget Bishop's examination filled the intervals of time while Mary
							Warren was being carried out of the meeting-house to recover from her
							fits. Both Parris and Ezekiel Cheever took minutes of it, from which the
							substance is gathered as follows: —</p>
						<p>On her coming in, the afflicted persons, at the same moment, severally
							fell into fits, and were dreadfully tormented. Hathorne addressed her,
							calling upon her to give an account of the witchcrafts she was
							“conversant in.” She replied, “I take all this people to witness that I
							am clear.” He then asked the children, “Hath this woman hurt you?” They
							all cried out that she had. The magistrate continued, “You are here
							accused by four or five: what do you say to it?” — “I never saw these
							persons before, nor I never<note target="v2n1" place="unspecified"
								anchored="yes">*</note> was in this place before. I never did hurt
							them in my life.”</p>
						<p>At a meeting of the afflicted children and others, some one declared that
							Bridget Bishop was present “in her shape” or apparition, and, pointing
							to a particular spot, said, “There, there she is!” Young Jonathan
							Walcot, exasperated by his sister's sufferings, struck at the spot with
							his sword; whereupon Mary cried out, “You have hit her, you have torn
							her coat, and I heard it tear.” This story had been brought to
							Hathorne's ears; and abruptly, as if to take her off her guard, <pb
								n="126" id="vII126"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2131">
								<figDesc>Page 126.</figDesc>
							</figure> he said, “Is not your coat cut?” She answered, “No.” They then
							examined the coat, and found what they regarded as having been “cut or
							torn two ways.” It was probably the fashion in which the garment was
							made; for she was in the habit of dressing more artistically than the
							women of the Village. At any rate, it did not appear like a direct cut
							of a sword; but Jonathan got over the difficulty by saying that “the
							sword that he struck at Goody Bishop was not naked, but was within the
							scabbard.” This explained the whole matter, so that Cheever says, in his
							report, that “the rent may very probably be the very same that Mary
							Walcot did tell that she had in her coat, by Jonathan's striking at her
							appearance”! Parris says, with more caution, more indeed than was usual
							with him, “Upon some search in the Court, a rent, that seems to answer
							what was alleged, was found.”</p>
						<p>Hathorne, having heard the scandals they had circulated against her,
							proceeded: “They say you bewitched your first husband to death.” — “If
							it please Your Worship, I know nothing of it.” — “What do you say of
							these murders you are charged with?” — “I hope I am not guilty of
							murder.” As she said this, she turned up her eyes, probably to give
							solemnity to her declaration. At the opening of the examination, she
							looked round upon the people, and called them to witness her innocence.
							She had found out by this time, that no justice could be expected from
							them; and feeling, with Rebecca Nurse on a recent similar occasion, “I
							have got nobody to look to but <pb n="127" id="vII127"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2132">
								<figDesc>Page 127.</figDesc>
							</figure> God,” she turned her eyes heavenward. Instantly, the eyeballs
							of all the girls were rolled up in their sockets, and fixed. The effect
							was awful, and still more increased as they went, after a moment or two,
							into dreadful torments. Hathorne could no longer contain himself, but
							broke out, “Do you not see how they are tormented? You are acting
							witchcraft before us! What do you say to this? Why have you not a heart
							to confess the truth?” She calmly replied, “I am innocent. I know
							nothing of it. I am no witch. I know not what a witch is.” The
							“afflicted children” charged her with having tried to persuade them to
							sign the Devil's book. As she had never before seen one of them, she was
							indignant at this barefaced falsehood, and, as Cheever says, “shook her
							head” in her resentment; which, as he further says, put them all into
							great torments. Parris represents that in every motion of her head they
							were tortured. Marshal Herrick, as usual, put in his oar, and
							volunteered charges against her. She bore herself well through the
							shocking scene, and did not shrink, at its close, from expressing her
							unbelief of the whole thing: “I do not know whether there be any witches
							or no.” When she was removed from the place of examination, the accusers
							all had fits, and broke forth in outcries of agony. After being taken
							out, one of the constables in charge of her asked her if she was not
							troubled to see the afflicted persons so tormented; and she replied,
							“No.” In answer to further questions, she indicated that she could not
								<pb n="128" id="vII128"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2133">
								<figDesc>Page 128.</figDesc>
							</figure> tell what to think of them, and did not concern herself about
							them at all.</p>
						<p>Giles Corey, Bridget Bishop, Abigail Hobbs, together with Mary Warren,
							were duly committed to prison.</p>
						<p>Two days after, April 21, warrants were issued “against William Hobbs,
							husbandman, and Deliverance his wife; Nehemiah Abbot, Jr., weaver; Mary
							Easty, the wife of Isaac Easty; and Sarah Wilds, the wife of John Wilds,
							— all of the town of Topsfield, or Ipswich; and Edward Bishop,
							husbandman, and Sarah his wife, of Salem Village; and Mary Black, a
							negro of Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam's, of Salem Village also; and Mary
							English, the wife of Philip English, merchant in Salem.” All of them
							were to be delivered to the magistrates for examination at the house of
							Lieutenant Nathaniel Ingersoll, at about ten o'clock the next morning,
							in Salem Village; and were brought in accordingly.</p>
						<p>What the papers on file enable us to glean of these nine persons is
							substantially as follows: William Hobbs was about fifty years of age,
							and one of the earliest settlers of the Village, although his residence
							was on the territory afterwards included in Topsfield. His daughter
							Abigail, of whom I have just spoken, appears from all the accounts to
							have acted at this stage of the transaction a most wicked part, ready to
							do all the mischief in her power, and allowing herself to be used to any
							extent to fasten the imputation of witchcraft upon others. Several
							persons testified that, long before, she had boasted that <pb n="129"
								id="vII129"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2134">
								<figDesc>Page 129.</figDesc>
							</figure> she was not afraid of any thing, “for she had sold herself
							body and soul to the Old Boy;” one witness testified, that, “some time
							last winter, I was discoursing with Abigail Hobbs about her wicked
							carriages and disobedience to her father and mother, and she told me she
							did not care what anybody said to her, for she had seen the Devil, and
							had made a covenant or bargain with him;” another, Margaret Knight,
							testified, that, about a year before, “Abigail Hobbs and her mother were
							at my father's house, and Abigail Hobbs said to me, `Margaret, are you
							baptized?' And I said, `Yes.' Then said she, `My mother is not baptized,
							but I will baptize her;' and immediately took water, and sprinkled in
							her mother's face, and said she did baptize her `in the name of the
							Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.”'</p>
						<p>She was arrested, and brought to the Village, on the 19th of April. The
							next day, she began her operations by declaring that “Judah White, a
							Jersey maid” that lived with Joseph Ingersoll at Casco, “but now lives
							at Boston,” appeared to her “in apparition” the day before, and advised
							her to “fly, and not to go to be examined,” but, if she did go, “not to
							confess any thing:” she described the dress of this “apparition,” — she
							“came to her in fine clothes, in a sad-colored silk mantle, with a
							top-knot and a hood.” — “She confesseth further, that the Devil in the
							shape of a man came to her,” and charged her to afflict the girls;
							bringing images made of wood in their likeness with thorns for her to
							prick into the images, which she <pb n="130" id="vII130"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2135">
								<figDesc>Page 130.</figDesc>
							</figure> did: whereupon the girls cried out that they were hurt by her.
							She further confessed, that, “she was at the great meeting in Mr.
							Parris's pasture, when they administered the sacrament, and did eat of
							the red bread and drink of the red wine, at the same time.” This
							confession established her credibility at once; and, the next day, the
							warrants were issued for the nine persons above mentioned, against whom
							they had secured in her an effective witness. She had resided for some
							time at Casco Bay; and we shall soon see how matters began in a few days
							to work in that direction. There are two indictments against this
							Abigail Hobbs: one charging her with having made a covenant with “the
							Evil Spirit, the Devil,” at Casco Bay, in 1688; the other with having
							exercised the arts o witchcraft upon the afflicted girls, at Salem
							Village, in 1692.</p>
						<p>When her unhappy father was brought to examination, he found that his
							daughter was playing into the hands of the accusers; and that his wife,
							overwhelmed by the horrors of the situation, although for a time
							protesting her innocence and lamenting that she had been the mother of
							such a daughter, had broken down and confessed, saying whatever might be
							put in her mouth by the magistrates, the girls, or the crowd. Under
							these circumstances, he was brought forward for examination. Parris took
							minutes of it. It is to be regretted, that the paper is much
							dilapidated, and portions of the lines wholly lost. What is left shows
							that the mind of William Hobbs rose superior <pb n="131" id="vII131"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2136">
								<figDesc>Page 131.</figDesc>
							</figure> to the terrors and powers arrayed against it. The magistrate
							commenced proceedings by inquiring of the girls, pointing to the
							prisoner, “Hath this man hurt you?” Several of them answered “Yes.”
							Goody Bibber, who seems generally to have been a very zealous volunteer
							backer of the girls, on this occasion, for a wonder, answered “No.” The
							magistrate, addressing the prisoner, “What say you? Are you guilty or
							not?” — Answer: “I can speak in the presence of God safely, as I must
							look to give account another day, that I am as clear as a new-born
							babe?” — “Clear of what?” — “Of witchcraft.” — “Have you never hurt
							these?” — “No.” Abigail Williams cried out that he “was going to Mercy
							Lewis!” Whereupon Mercy was seized with a fit. Then Abigail cried out
							again, “He is coming to Mary Walcot!” and Mary went into her fit. The
							magistrate, in consternation, appealed to him: “How can you be clear,”
							when your appearance is thus seen producing such effects before our
							eyes? Then the children went into fits all together, and “hallooed” at
							the top of their voices, and “shouted greatly.” The magistrate then
							brought up the confession of his wife against him, and expostulated with
							him for not confessing; the afflicted, in the mean while, bringing the
							whole machinery of their convulsions, shrieks, and uproar to bear
							against him: but he calmly, and in brief terms, denied it.</p>
						<p>The circle of accusing girls seems to have been a receptacle, into which
							all the scandal, gossip, and <pb n="132" id="vII132"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2137">
								<figDesc>Page 132.</figDesc>
							</figure> defamation of the surrounding country was emptied. Some one
							had told them that William Hobbs was not a regular attendant at meeting.
							They passed it on to the magistrate, and he put this question to the
							accused: “When were you at any public religious meeting?” He replied,
							“Not a pretty while.” — “Why so?” — “Because I was not well: I had a
							distemper that none knows.” The magistrate said, “Can you act witchcraft
							here, and, by casting your eyes, turn folks into fits?” — “You may judge
							your pleasure. My soul is clear.” — “Do you not see you hurt these by
							your look?” — “No: I do not know it.” After another display of awful
							sufferings, caused, as they protested, by the mere look of Hobbs, the
							magistrate, with triumphant confidence, again put it home to him, “Can
							you now deny it?” He answered, “I can deny it to my dying day.” The
							magistrate inquired of him for what reason he withdrew from the room
							whenever the Scriptures were read in his family. He plumply denied it.
							Nathaniel Ingersoll and Thomas Haynes testified that his daughter had
							told them so. The confessions of his wife and daughter were over and
							over again brought up against him, but to no effect. “Who do you
							worship?” said the magistrate. “I hope I worship God only.” — “Where?” —
							“In my heart.” The examination failed to confound or embarrass him in
							the least. He could not be drawn into the expression of any of the
							feelings which the conduct of his graceless and depraved daughter or his
							weak and wretched wife must have <pb n="133" id="vII133"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2138">
								<figDesc>Page 133.</figDesc>
							</figure> excited. He quietly protested that he knew nothing about
							witchcraft; and, towards the close, with solemn earnestness of
							utterance, declared that his innocence was known to the “great God in
							heaven.”</p>
						<p>He was committed for trial. All that the documents in existence inform us
							further, in relation to William Hobbs, is that he remained in prison
							until the 14th of the next December, when two of his neighbors, John
							Nichols and Joseph Towne, in some way succeeded in getting him bailed
							out; they giving bonds in the sum of two hundred pounds for his
							appearance at the sessions of the Court the next month. But it was not,
							even then, thought wholly safe to have him come in; and the fine was
							incurred. He appeared at the term in May, the fine was remitted, and he
							discharged by proclamation. On the 26th of March, 1714, he gave evidence
							in a case of commonage rights. He was then seventy-two years of age. Of
							his wife and daughter, I shall again have occasion to speak.</p>
						<p>For all that is known of the case of Nehemiah Abbot, we are indebted to
							Hutchinson, who had Parris's minutes of the examination before him.
							Hutchinson says, that, of “near an hundred” whose examinations he had
							seen, he was the only one who, having been brought before the
							magistrates, was finally dismissed by them. Perhaps even this case was
							not an exception: for a document on file shows that a person named Abbot
							of the same locality was subsequently arrested and imprisoned; but
							unfortunately <pb n="134" id="vII134"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2139">
								<figDesc>Page 134.</figDesc>
							</figure> the Christian name has been obliterated, or from some cause is
							wanting. It seems, from Hutchinson's minutes, that he protested his
							innocence in manly and firm declarations. Mary Walcot testified that she
							had seen his shape. Ann Putnam cried out that she saw him “upon the
							beam.” The magistrates told him that his guilt was certainly proved, and
							that, if he would find mercy of God, he must confess. “I speak before
							God,” he answered, “that I am clear from this accusation.” — “What, in
							all respects?” — “Yes, in all respects.” The girls were struck with
							dumbness; and Ann Putnam, re-affirming that he was the man that hurt
							her, “was taken with a fit.” Mary Walcot began to waver in her
							confidence, and Mercy Lewis said, “It is not the man.” This
							unprecedented variance in the testimony of the girls brought matters to
							a stand; and he was sent out for a time, while others were examined:
							—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“When he was brought in again, by reason of much people, and many in
								the windows, so that the accusers could not have a clear view of
								him, he was ordered to be abroad, and the accusers to go forth to
								him, and view him in the light, which they did in the presence of
								the magistrates and many others, discoursed quietly with him, one
								and all acquitting him; but yet said he was like that man, but he
								had not the wen they saw in his apparition. Note, he was a
								hilly-faced man, and stood shaded by reason of his own hair; so that
								for a time he seemed to some bystanders and observers to be
								considerably like the person the afflicted did describe.”</p>
						</q>
						<pb n="135" id="vII135"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2140">
								<figDesc>Page 135.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>Such is Parris's statement, as quoted by Hutchinson. What was the real
							cause or motive of this discrepancy among the witnesses does not appear.
							The facts, that at first they went into fits in beholding him, were all
							struck dumb for a while, and Ann Putnam saw him on the beam, were likely
							to have an unfavorable effect upon the minds of the people, and
							threatened to explode the delusion. But Ann, with a quickness of wit
							that never failed to meet any emergency, when Mercy Lewis said it was
							not the man, cried out in a fit, “Did you put a mist before my eyes?”
							She conveyed the idea that the power of Satan blinded her, and caused
							her to mistake the man. This answered the purpose; and, although Abbot
							got clear, for the time at least, all were more than ever convinced that
							the Evil One, in misleading Ann, had shown his hand on the occasion.</p>
						<p>The examination of Sarah Wildes had no peculiar features. The afflicted
							children and Goody Bibber saw her apparition sitting on the beam while
							she was bodily present at the bar, and went through their usual fits and
							evolutions. She maintained her innocence with dignity and firmness; and
							the magistrate, prejudging the case against her, rebuked her obstinacy
							in not confessing, in his accustomed manner.</p>
						<p>No account has come down of the examinations of Edward Bishop, or Sarah
							his wife. He was the third of that name, probably the son of the
							“Sawyer.” His wife Sarah was a daughter of William Wildes of Ipswich,
							and, it would seem, a sister of John <pb n="136" id="vII136"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2141">
								<figDesc>Page 136.</figDesc>
							</figure> Wildes, the examination of whose wife has just been mentioned.
							Some of the evidence indicates that she was a niece of Rebecca Nurse.
							They all belonged to that class of persons who, under the general
							appellation of “the Topsfield men,” had been in such frequent collision
							with the people of the Village. Edward Bishop was forty-four years of
							age, and his wife forty. They had a family, at the time of their
							imprisonment, of twelve children. Sarah Bishop had been dismissed from
							the church at the Village, and recommended to that at Topsfield, May 25,
							1690. They had land in Topsfield, as well as in the Village, and were
							more intimately connected in social relations with the former than the
							latter place. They effected their escape from prison, and survived the
							storm. Mary, the wife of Philip English, was committed to prison. We
							have no record of her examination.</p>
						<p>Mary Black, the negro woman, belonged to Nathaniel Putnam, but lived in
							the family of his son Benjamin. Her examination shows that she was an
							ignorant but an innocent person. She knew nothing about the matter, and
							had no idea what it all meant. To the questions with which the
							magistrate pressed her, her answers were, “I do not know,” “I cannot
							tell.” The only fact brought out against her besides the actings of the
							girls was this: “Her master saith a man sat down upon the form with her
							about a twelvemonth ago.” Parris, in his minutes, gives this piece of
							evidence, but does not enlighten us as to its import. The magistrate
							asked her, “What did the man <pb n="137" id="vII137"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2142">
								<figDesc>Page 137.</figDesc>
							</figure> say to you?” Her answer was: “He said nothing.” This is all
							they got out of her; and it is all the light we have on the mysterious
							fact, that a man was once seated, at some time within twelve months, on
							the same form or bench with poor Mary Black. The magistrate asked the
							girls, “Doth this negro hurt you?” They said “Yes.” — “Why do you hurt
							them?” — “I did not hurt them.” This question was put to her, “Do you
							prick sticks?” perhaps the meaning was, Do you prick the afflicted
							children with sticks? The simple creature evidently did not know what
							they were driving at, and answered, “No: I pin my neckcloth.” The
							examiner asked her, “Will you take out the pin, and pin it again?” She
							did so, and several of the afflicted cried out that they were pricked.
							Mary Walcot was pricked in the arm till the blood came, Abigail Williams
							was pricked in the stomach, and Mercy Lewis was pricked in the foot. It
							is probable, that, in this case, the girls, as they often appear to have
							done, provided themselves by concert beforehand with pins ready to be
							stuck into the assigned parts of their bodies, and managed to get the
							queer and unusual question put. The whole thing has the appearance of
							being pre-arranged; and it answered the purpose, filling the crowd with
							amazement, and excluding all possible doubt from the minds of the
							magistrates. Mary was committed to prison, where she remained until
							discharged, in May, 1693, by proclamation from the governor.</p>
						<p>Mary Easty, wife of Isaac Easty, and sister of Rebecca <pb n="138"
								id="vII138"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2143">
								<figDesc>Page 138.</figDesc>
							</figure> Nurse and Sarah Cloyse, was about fifty-eight years of age,
							and the mother of seven children. Her husband owned and lived upon a
							large and valuable farm, which not many years since was the property and
							country residence of the late Hon. B. W. Crowninshield, and is now in
							the possession of Thomas Pierce, Esq. Her examination was accompanied by
							the usual circumstances. The girls had fits, and were speechless at
							times: the magistrate expostulated with her for not confessing her
							guilt, which he regarded as demonstrated, beyond a question, by the
							sufferings of the afflicted. “Would you have me accuse myself?” — “How
							far,” he continued, “have you complied with Satan?” — “Sir, I never
							complied, but prayed against him all my days. What would you have me
							do?” — “Confess, if you be guilty.” — “I will say it, if it was my last
							time, I am clear of this sin.” The magistrate, apparently affected by
							her manner and bearing, inquired of the girls, “Are you certain this is
							the woman?” They all went into fits; and presently Ann Putnam, coming to
							herself, said “that was the woman, it was like her, and she told me her
							name.” The accused clasped her hands together, and Mercy Lewis's hands
							were clenched; she separated her hands, and Mercy's were released; she
							inclined her head, and the girls screamed out, “Put up her head; for,
							while her head is bowed, the necks of these are broken.” The magistrate
							again asked, “Is this the woman?” They made signs that they could not
							speak; but afterwards Ann Putnam and others <pb n="139" id="vII139"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2144">
								<figDesc>Page 139.</figDesc>
							</figure> cried out: “O Goody Easty, Goody Easty, you are the woman, you
							are the woman!” — “What do you say to this?” — “Why, God will know.” —
							“Nay, God knows now.” — “I know he does.” — “What did you think of the
							actions of others before your sisters came out? did you think it was
							witchcraft?” — “I cannot tell.” — “Why do you not think it is
							witchcraft?” — “It is an evil spirit; but whether it be witchcraft I do
							not know.” She was committed to prison.</p>
						<p>It will be noticed that seven out of the nine examined at this time
							either lived in Topsfield or were intimately connected with the church
							and people there. The accusing girls had heard them angrily spoken of by
							the people around them, and availed themselves, as at all times, of
							existing prejudices, to guide them in the selection of their victim.</p>
						<p>The escape of Abbot, and the wavering, in his case and that of Easty,
							indicated by the magistrates on this occasion, alarmed the prosecutors;
							and they felt that something must be done to stiffen Hathorne and Corwin
							to their previous rigid method of procedure. The following letter was
							accordingly written to them that very day, immediately after the close
							of the examinations: —</p>

						<p>What was meant by the “wheel within a wheel,” the “high and dreadful”
							things which were making their ears to tingle, but had not yet been
							disclosed to the magistrates, we shall presently see. On the 30th of
							April, Captain Jonathan Walcot and Sergeant Thomas Putnam (the writer of
							the foregoing letter) got out a warrant against Philip English, of
							Salem, merchant; Sarah Morrel, of Beverly; and Dorcas Hoar, of the same
							place, widow. Morrel and Hoar were delivered by Marshal Herrick,
							according to the tenor of the warrant, at 11, A.M., May 2, at the house
							of Lieutenant Nathaniel Ingersoll, in Salem Village. The warrant has an
							indorsement in these words: “Mr. Philip English not being to be found.
							G. H.” As the records of the examinations of Philip English <pb n="141"
								id="vII141"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2146">
								<figDesc>Page 141.</figDesc>
							</figure> and his wife have not been preserved, and only a few fragments
							of the testimony relating to their case are to be found, all that can be
							said is that the girls and their accomplices made their usual charges
							against them. There are two depositions in existence, however, which
							afford some explanation of the causes that exposed Mr. English to
							hostility, and indicate the kind of evidence that was brought against
							him. Having many landed estates, in various places, and extensive
							business transactions, he was liable to frequent questions of
							litigation. He was involved, at one time, in a lawsuit about the bounds
							of a piece of land in Marblehead. A person named William Beale, of that
							town, had taken great interest in it adversely to the claims of English;
							and some harsh words passed between them. A year or two after the
							affair, Beale states, “that, as I lay in my bed, in the morning,
							presently after it was fair light abroad in the room,” “I saw a dark
							shade,” &amp;c. To his vision it soon assumed the shape of Philip
							English. On a previous occasion, when riding through Lynn to get
							testimony against English in the aforesaid boundary case, he says, “My
							nose gushed out bleeding in a most extraordinary manner, so that it
							bloodied a handkerchief of considerable bigness, and also ran down upon
							my clothes and upon my horse's mane.” He charged it upon English. These
							depositions were sworn to in Court, in August, 1692, and January, 1693.
							How they got there does not appear, as English was never brought to
							trial. All that relates to Mr. <pb n="142" id="vII142"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2147">
								<figDesc>Page 142.</figDesc>
							</figure> English and his wife may be despatched at this point. On the
							6th of May, a warrant was procured at Boston, “To the marshal-general,
							or his lawful deputy,” to apprehend Philip English wherever found within
							the jurisdiction, and convey him to the “custody of the marshal of
							Essex.” Jacob Manning, a deputy, delivered him to the marshal of Essex
							on the 30th of May; and he was brought before the magistrates on the
							next day, and, after examination, committed to prison. He and his wife
							effected their escape from jail, and found refuge in New York until the
							proceedings were terminated, when they returned to Salem, and continued
							to reside here. She survived the shock given by the accusation, the
							danger to which she had been exposed, and the sufferings of
							imprisonment, but a short time. They occupied the highest social
							position. He was a merchant, conducting an extensive business, and had a
							large estate; owning fourteen buildings in the town, a wharf, and
							twenty-one sail of vessels. His dwellinghouse, represented in the
							frontispiece of this volume, stood until a recent period, and is
							remembered by many of us. Its site was on the southern side of Essex
							Street, near its termination; comprising the area between English and
							Webb Streets. It must have been a beautiful situation; commanding at
							that time a full, unobstructed view of the Beverly and Marblehead
							shores, and all the waters and points of land between them. The mansion
							was spacious in its dimensions, and bore the marks of having been
							constructed in the <pb n="143" id="vII143"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2148">
								<figDesc>Page 143.</figDesc>
							</figure> best style of elegance, strength, and finish. It was indeed a
							curious and venerable specimen of the domestic architecture of its day.
							A first-class house then; in its proportions, arrangements, and
							attachments, it would compare well with first-class houses now. Mrs.
							English was a lady of eminent character and culture. Traditions to this
							effect have come down with singular uniformity through all the old
							families of the place. She was the only child of Richard Hollingsworth,
							and inherited his large property. The Rev. William Bentley, D.D., in his
							“Description of Salem,” and whose daily life made him conversant with
							all that relates to the locality of Mrs. English's residence, says that
							the officer came to apprehend her in the evening, after she had retired
							to rest. He was admitted by the servants, and read his warrant in her
							bedchamber. Guards were placed around the house. To be accused by the
							afflicted children was then regarded as certain death. “In the morning,”
							says Bentley, “she attended the devotions of her family, kissed her
							children with great composure, proposed her plan for their education,
							took leave of them, and then told the officer she was ready to die.” Dr.
							Bentley suggests that unfriendly feelings may have existed against Mr.
							English in consequence of some controversies he had been engaged in with
							the town about the title to lands; that the superior style in which his
							family lived had subjected them to vulgar prejudice; that the existence
							of this feeling becoming known to the “afflicted girls” led them <pb
								n="144" id="vII144"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2149">
								<figDesc>Page 144.</figDesc>
							</figure> to cry out against him and his wife. It may be so. They
							availed themselves of every such advantage; and particularly liked to
							strike high, so as the more to astound and overawe the public mind.</p>
						<p>I find no further mention of Sarah Morrel. She doubtless shared the fate
							of those escaping death, — a long imprisonment. When Dorcas Hoar was
							brought in, there was a general commotion among the afflicted, falling
							into fits all around. After coming out of them, they vied with each
							other in heaping all sorts of accusations upon the prisoner; Abigail
							Williams and Ann Putnam charging her with having choked a woman in
							Boston; Elizabeth Hubbard crying out that she was pinching her, “and
							showing the marks to the standers by. The marshal said she pinched her
							fingers at the time.” The magistrate, indignantly believing the whole,
							said, “Dorcas Hoar, why do you hurt these?” — “I never hurt any child in
							my life.” The girls then charged her with having killed her husband, and
							with various other crimes. Mary Walcot, Susanna Sheldon, and Abigail
							Williams said they saw a black man whispering in her ear. The spirit of
							the prisoner was raised; and she said, “Oh, you are liars, and God will
							stop the mouth of liars!” The anger of the magistrates was roused by
							this bold outbreak. “You are not to speak after this manner in the
							Court.” — “I will speak the truth as long as I live,” she fearlessly
							replied. Parris says, at the close of his account, “The afflicted were
							much distressed <pb n="145" id="vII145"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2150">
								<figDesc>Page 145.</figDesc>
							</figure> during her examination.” Of course, she was sent to
							prison.</p>
						<p>Susanna Martin of Amesbury, a widow, was arrested on a warrant dated
							April 30, and examined at the Village church May 2. She is described as
							a short active woman, wearing a hood and scarf, plump and well developed
							in her figure, of remarkable personal neatness. One of the items of the
							evidence against her was, that, “in an extraordinary dirty season, when
							it was not fit for any person to travel, she came on foot” to a house at
							Newbury. The woman of the house, the substance of whose testimony I am
							giving, having asked, “whether she came from Amesbury afoot,” expressed
							her surprise at her having ventured abroad in such bad walking, and bid
							her children make way for her to come to the fire to dry herself. She
							replied “she was as dry as I was,” and turned her coats aside; “and I
							could not perceive that the soles of her shoes were wet. I was startled
							at it, that she should come so dry; and told her that I should have been
							wet up to my knees, if I should have come so far on foot.” She replied
							that “she scorned to have a drabbled tail.” The good woman who treated
							Susanna Martin on this occasion with such hospitable kindness received
							the impression, as appears by the import of her deposition, that,
							because Martin came into the house so wonderfully dry, she was therefore
							a witch. The only inference we are likely to draw is, that she was a
							particularly neat person; careful to pick her <pb n="146" id="vII146"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2151">
								<figDesc>Page 146.</figDesc>
							</figure> way; and did not wear skirts of the dimensions of our
							times.</p>
						<p>The language reported by this witness to have been used by Susanna Martin
							created in her, at the time, visible mortification, as well as
							resentment. A writer at the period, not by any means inclined to give a
							representation favorable to the prisoners, reports her expression thus:
							“She scorned to be drabbled.” She was undoubtedly a woman who spoke her
							mind freely, and with strength of expression, as the magistrates found.
							From this cause, perhaps, she had shocked the prejudices and violated
							the conventional scrupulosities then prevalent, to such a degree as to
							incur much comment, if not scandal. There had been a good deal of gossip
							about her; and, some time before, she had been proceeded against as a
							witch. But there was no ground for any serious charges against her
							character. Like Mrs. Ann Hibbens, perhaps the head and front of her
							offending was that she had more wit than her neighbors. She certainly
							was a strongminded woman, as her examination shows. Two reports of it,
							each in the handwriting of Parris, have come down to us. They are almost
							identical, and in substance as follows: —</p>
						<p>On the appearance of the accused, many of the witnesses against her
							instantly fell into fits. The magistrate inquired of them, —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Hath this woman hurt you?”</p>
							<p>“(Abigail Williams declared that she had hurt her <pb n="147"
									id="vII147"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2152">
									<figDesc>Page 147.</figDesc>
								</figure> often. `Ann Putnam threw her glove at her in a fit,' and
								the rest were struck dumb at her presence.)</p>
							<p>“What! do you laugh at it? said the magistrate. — Well I may at such
								folly.</p>
							<p>“Is this folly to see these so hurt? — I never hurt man, woman, or
								child.</p>
							<p>“(Mercy Lewis cried out, `She hath hurt me a great many times, and
								plucks me down.' Then Martin laughed again. Several others cried out
								upon her, and the magistrate again addressed her.)</p>
							<p>“What do you say to this? — I have no hand in witchcraft.</p>
							<p>“What did you do? did you consent these should be hurt? — No, never
								in my life.</p>
							<p>“What ails these people? — I do not know.</p>
							<p>“But what do you think ails them? — I do not desire to spend my
								judgment upon it.</p>
							<p>“Do you think they are bewitched? — No: I do not think they are.</p>
							<p>“Well, tell us your thoughts about them. — My thoughts are mine own
								when they are in; but, when they are out, they are another's.</p>
							<p>“Who do you think is their master? — If they be dealing in the black
								art, you may know as well as I.</p>
							<p>“What have you done towards the hurt of these? — I have done
								nothing.</p>
							<p>“Why, it is you, or your appearance. — I cannot help it.</p>
							<p>“How comes your appearance just now to hurt these? — How do I
								know?</p>
							<p>“Are you not willing to tell the truth? — I cannot tell. He that
								appeared in Samuel's shape can appear in any one's shape.</p>
							<pb n="148" id="vII148"/>
							<p>
								<figure id="Uphv2153">

							</p>
							<p>“Do you believe these afflicted persons do not say true? — They may
								lie, for aught I know.</p>
							<p>“May not you lie? — I dare not tell a lie, if it would save my
								life.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>At this point, the marshal declared that “she pinched her hands, and
							Elizabeth Hubbard was immediately afflicted. Several of the afflicted
							cried out that they saw her upon the beam” of the meeting over their
							heads; and there was, no doubt, a scene of frightful excitement. The
							magistrate, in the depth of his awe and distress, earnestly appealed to
							the accused, “Pray God discover you, if you be guilty.” Nothing daunted,
							she replied, “Amen, amen. A false tongue will never make a guilty
							person.” A great uproar then arose. The accusers fell into dreadful
							convulsions, among the rest John Indian, who cried out, “She bites, she
							bites!” The magistrate, overcome by the sight of these sufferings, again
							appealed to her, “Have not you compassion for these afflicted?” She
							calmly and firmly answered, “No: I have none.” The uproar rose higher.
							The accusers all declared that they saw the “black man,” Satan himself,
							standing by her side. They pretended to try to approach her, but were
							suddenly deprived of the power of locomotion. John Indian attempted to
							rush upon her, but fell sprawling upon the floor. The magistrate again
							appealed to her: “What is the reason these cannot come near you?” — “I
							cannot tell. It may be the Devil bears me more malice than another.” —
							“Do <pb n="149" id="vII149"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2154">
								<figDesc>Page 149.</figDesc>
							</figure> you not see God evidently discovering you?” — “No, not a bit
							for that.” — “All the congregation besides think so.” — “Let them think
							what they will.” — “What is the reason these cannot come to you?” — “I
							do not know but they can, if they will; or else, if you please, I will
							come to them.” — “What was that the black man whispered to you?” —
							“There was none whispered to me.” She was committed to prison.</p>

					<p>In the mean while, preparations had been going on to bring upon the stage a
						more striking character, and give to the excited public mind a greater shock
						than had yet been experienced. Intimations had been thrown out that higher
						culprits than had been so far brought to light were in reserve, and would,
						in due time, be unmasked. It was hinted that a minister had joined the
						standard of the Arch-enemy, and was leading the devilish confederacy. In the

						hanging the regicides, at the Restoration, was looking about for a preacher
						to hang, and used Hugh Peters for the occasion; so the “afflicted children,”
						or those acting behind them, wanted a minister to complete the <hi
							rend="italics">dramatis personœ</hi> of their tragedy. His connection
						with the society and its controversies, and the animosities which had thus
						become attached to him, naturally suggested Mr. Burroughs. He was then
						pursuing, as usual, a laborious, humble, self-sacrificing ministry, in the
						midst of perils and privations, away <pb n="150" id="vII150"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2155">
							<figDesc>Page 150.</figDesc>
						</figure> down in the frontier settlements on the coast of Maine, and little
						dreamed of what was brewing, for his ruin and destruction, in his former
						parish at the village. This is what Thomas Putnam had in his mind when he
						spoke of a “wheel within a wheel,” and “the high and dreadful” things not
						then disclosed that were to make “ears tingle.”</p>
					<p>It was necessary to be at once cautious and rapid in their movements, to
						prevent the public from getting information which, by reaching the ears of
						Burroughs, might put him on his guard. It was no easy thing to secure him at
						the great distance of his place of residence. If he should become apprised
						of what was going on, his escape into remoter and inaccessible settlements
						would have baffled the whole scheme. Nothing therefore was done at the
						village, but the steps to arrest him originated at Boston. Elisha
						Hutchinson, a magistrate there, issued the proper order, addressed to John
						Partridge of Portsmouth, Field-marshal of the provinces of New Hampshire and
						Maine, dated April 30, 1692, to arrest George Burroughs, “preacher at
						Wells;” he being “suspected of a confederacy with the Devil.” Partridge was
						directed to deliver him to the custody of the marshal of Essex, or, not
						meeting him, was requested to bring him to Salem, and hand him over to the
						magistrates there. The “afflicted children” had begun, shortly before, to
						use his name. Abigail Hobbs had resided some years before at Casco; and from
						her they obtained all the scandal she had heard there, or chose to fabricate
						to suit the <pb n="151" id="vII151"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2156">
							<figDesc>Page 151.</figDesc>
						</figure> purpose of the prosecutors. The way in which the minds of the
						deluded people were worked up against Mr. Burroughs is illustrated in a
						deposition subsequently made to this effect: —</p>
					<p>Benjamin Hutchinson testified, that, on the 21st of April, 1692, about eleven
						o'clock in the forenoon, Abigail Williams told him that she saw a person
						whom she described as Mr. George Burroughs, “a little black minister that
						lived at Casco Bay.” Mr. Burroughs was of small stature and dark complexion.
						She gave an account of his wonderful feats of strength, said that he was a
						wizard; and that he “had killed three wives, two for himself and one for Mr.
						Lawson.” She affirmed that she saw him then. Mr. Burroughs, it will be borne
						in mind, was at this time a hundred miles away, at his home in Maine.
						Hutchinson asked her where she saw him. She said “There,” pointing to a rut
						in the road made by a cart-wheel. He had an iron fork in his hand, and threw
						it where she said Burroughs was standing. Instantly she fell into a fit;
						and, when she came out of it, said, “`You have torn his coat, for I heard it
						tear.' — `Whereabouts?' said I. `On one side,' said she. Then we came into
						the house of Lieutenant Ingersoll; and I went into the great room, and
						Abigail came in and said, `There he stands.' I said, `Where? where?' and
						presently drew my rapier.” Then Abigail said, he has gone, but “`there is a
						gray cat.' Then I said, `Whereabouts?' `There!' said she, `there!' Then I
						struck with my rapier, and she fell into a fit; and, when it <pb n="152"
							id="vII152"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2157">
							<figDesc>Page 152.</figDesc>
						</figure> was over, she said, `You killed her.”' Poor Hutchinson could not
						see the cat he had killed any more than Burroughs's coat he had torn.
						Abigail explained the mystery to his satisfaction, by saying that the
						spectre of Sarah Good had come in at the moment, and carried away the dead
						cat. This was all in broad daylight; it being, as Hutchinson testified,
						“about twelve o'clock.” The same day, “after lecture, in said Ingersoll's
						chamber,” Abigail Williams and Mary Walcot were present. They said that
						“Goody Hobbs, of Topsfield, had bit Mary Walcot by the foot.” Then both fell
						into a fit; and on coming out, “they saw William Hobbs and his wife go both
						of them along the table.” Hutchinson instantly stabbed, with his rapier,
						“Goody Hobbs on her side,” as the two girls declared. They further said that
						the room was “full of them,” that is of witches, in their apparitions; then
						Hutchinson and Eleazer Putnam “stabbed with their rapiers at a venture.” The
						girls cried out, that they “had killed a great black woman of Stonington,
						and an Indian who had come with her:” the girls said further, “The floor is
						all covered with blood;” and, rushing to the window, declared that they saw
						a great company of witches on a hill, and that three of them “lay dead”
						there, — “the black woman, the Indian, and one more that they knew not.”
						This was about four o'clock in the afternoon. This evidence was given and
						received in court. It shows the audacity with which the girls imposed upon
						the credulity of a people wrought up by their arts to the highest pitch of
						insane <pb n="153" id="vII153"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2158">
							<figDesc>Page 153.</figDesc>
						</figure> infatuation; and illustrates a condition of things, at that time
						and place, that is truly astonishing.</p>
					<p>On the evening before Hutchinson was imposed upon, as just described, by
						Abigail Williams and Mary Walcot, Ann Putnam had made most astonishing
						disclosures, at her father's house, in his presence and that of Peter
						Prescott, Robert Morrel, and Ezekiel Cheever. An account of the affair was
						drawn up by her father, and sworn to by her, in these words: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> who testifieth
							and saith, on the 20th of April, 1692, at evening, she saw the
							apparition of a minister, at which she was grievously affrighted, and
							cried out, `Oh, dreadful, dreadful! here is a minister come! What! are
							ministers witches too? Whence came you, and what is your name? for I
							will complain of you, though you be a minister, if you be a wizard.'
							Immediately I was tortured by him, being racked and almost choked by
							him. And he tempted me to write in his book, which I refused with loud
							outcries, and said I would not write in his book though he tore me all
							to pieces, but told him it was a dreadful thing that he, which was a
							minister, that should teach children to fear God, should come to
							persuade poor creatures to give their souls to the Devil. `Oh, dreadful,
							dreadful! Tell me your name, that I may know who you are.' Then again he
							tortured me, and urged me to write in his book, which I refused. And
							then, presently, he told me that his name was George Burroughs, and that
							he had had three wives, and that he had bewitched the two first of them
							to death; and that he killed Mrs. Lawson, because she was so unwilling
							to go from the Village, and also killed Mr. Lawson's child because he
							went <pb n="154" id="vII154"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2159">
								<figDesc>Page 154.</figDesc>
							</figure> to the eastward with Sir Edmon, and preached so to the
							soldiers; and that he had bewitched a great many soldiers to death at
							the eastward when Sir Edmon was there; and that he had made Abigail
							Hobbs a witch, and several witches more. And he has continued ever
							since, by times, tempting me to write in his book, and grievously
							torturing me by beating, pinching, and almost choking me several times a
							day. He also told me that he was above a witch. He was a conjurer.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Her father and the other persons present made oath that they saw and heard
						all this at the time; that “they beheld her tortures and perceived her
						hellish temptations by her loud outcries, `I will not, I will not write,
						though you torment me all the days of my life.”' It will be observed that
						this was the evening before Thomas Putnam wrote his letter to the
						magistrates, preparing them for something “high and dreadful” that was soon
						to be brought to light.</p>
					<p>A similar scene took place not long afterwards, in the presence of her father
						and her uncle Edward, to which they also testify. It was thus described by
						her under oath: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> who testifieth
							and saith, that, on the 8th of May, at evening, I saw the apparition of
							Mr. George Burroughs, who grievously tortured me, and urged me to write
							in his book, which I refused. He then told me that his two first wives
							would appear to me presently, and tell me a great many lies, but I
							should not believe them. Then immediately appeared to me the forms of
							two women in winding-sheets, and napkins about <pb n="155" id="vII155"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2160">
								<figDesc>Page 155.</figDesc>
							</figure> their heads, at which I was greatly affrighted; and they
							turned their faces towards Mr. Burroughs, and looked very red and angry,
							and told him that he had been a cruel man to them, and that their blood
							did cry for vengeance against him; and also told him that they should be
							clothed with white robes in heaven, when he should be cast into hell;
							and immediately he vanished away. And, as soon as he was gone, the two
							women turned their faces towards me, and looked as pale as a white wall;
							and told me that they were Mr. Burroughs's two first wives, and that he
							had murdered them. And one of them told me that she was his first wife,
							and he stabbed her under the left arm, and put a piece of sealing-wax on
							the wound. And she pulled aside the winding-sheet, and showed me the
							place; and also told me, that she was in the house where Mr. Parris now
							lives, when it was done. And the other told me, that Mr. Burroughs and
							that wife which he hath now, killed her in the vessel, as she was coming
							to see her friends, because they would have one another. And they both
							charged me that I should tell these things to the magistrates before Mr.
							Burroughs' face; and, if he did not own them, they did not know but they
							should appear there. This morning, also, Mrs. Lawson and her daughter
							Ann appeared to me, whom I knew, and told me Mr. Burroughs murdered
							them. This morning also appeared to me another woman in a winding-sheet,
							and told me that she was Goodman Fuller's first wife, and Mr. Burroughs
							killed her because there was some difference between her husband and
							him.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>This was indeed most extraordinary language and imagery to have been used by
						a child of twelve years of age. It is not strange, that, upon a community,
							<pb n="156" id="vII156"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2161">
							<figDesc>Page 156.</figDesc>
						</figure> whose fancies and fears had been so long wrought upon, holding
						their views, the effect was awfully great. The very fact that it was a child
						that spoke made her declarations seem supernatural. Then, again, they were
						accompanied with such ocular demonstration, in her terrible bodily
						sufferings, that none remained in doubt of the truthfulness and reality of
						what they listened to and beheld. It did not enter their imaginations, for a
						moment, that there was any deception or imposture, or even delusion, on her
						part. Her case is truly a problem not easily solved even now. While we are
						filled with horror and indignation at the thought that she figures as a
						capital and fatal witness in all the trials, it is impossible not to feel
						that a wisdom greater than ours is necessary to fathom the dark mystery of
						the phenomena presented by her and her mother and other accusers, in this
						monstrous and terrible affair.</p>
					<p>These occurrences, happening just before Mr. Burroughs was brought to the
						village as a prisoner, were bruited from house to house, from mouth to
						mouth, and worked the people to a state of horrified exasperation against
						him; and he was met with execration, when, on the 4th of May, Field-marshal
						Partridge appeared with him at Salem, and delivered him to the jailer there.
						When we consider the distance and the circumstances of travel at that time,
						it is evident that the officers charged with the service acted with the
						greatest promptitude, celerity, and energy. The tradition is, that they
						found Mr. Burroughs in his humble <pb n="157" id="vII157"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2162">
							<figDesc>Page 157.</figDesc>
						</figure> home, partaking of his frugal meal; that he was snatched from the
						table without a moment's opportunity to provide for his family, or prepare
						himself for the journey, and hurried on his way roughly, and without the
						least explanation of what it all meant. As soon as it was known that he was
						in jail in Salem, arrangements were commenced for his examination. The
						public mind was highly excited; and it was determined to make the occasion
						as impressive, effective, and awe-striking as possible. Another “field-day”
						was to be had. On the 9th of May, a special session of the Magistracy was
						held, — William Stoughton coming from Dorchester, and Samuel Sewall from
						Boston, to sit with Hathorne and Corwin, and give greater solemnity and
						severity to the proceedings. Stoughton presided. The first step in the
						proceedings was to have a private hearing, in the presence of the
						magistrates and ministers only; and the report of what passed there gives
						proof of what is indicated more or less clearly in several passages in the
						accounts that have come down to us in reference to Mr. Burroughs, — that he
						was regarded as not wholly sound in doctrine on points not connected with
						witchcraft, was treated with special severity on that account, and made the
						victim of bigoted prejudice among his brethren and in the churches. In this
						secret inquisition, he was called to account for not attending the communion
						service on one or two occasions; he being a member of the church at Roxbury.
						It was also brought against him, that none of his children but the eldest
						had been <pb n="158" id="vII158"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2163">
							<figDesc>Page 158.</figDesc>
						</figure> baptized. What the facts, in these respects, were, it is
						impossible to say; as we know of them only through the charges of his
						enemies. After this, he was carried to the place of public meeting; and, as
						he entered the room, “many, if not all, the bewitched were grievously
						tortured.” After the confusion had subsided, Susanna Sheldon testified that
						Burroughs' two wives had appeared to her “in their winding-sheets,” and
						said, “That man killed them.” He was ordered to look on the witness; and, as
						he turned to do so, he “knocked down,” as the reporter affirms, “all (or
						most) of the afflicted that stood behind him.” Ann Putnam, and the several
						other “afflicted children,” bore their testimony in a similar strain against
						him, interspersing at intervals, all their various convulsions, outcries,
						and tumblings. Mercy Lewis had “a dreadful and tedious fit.” Walcot,
						Hubbard, and Sheldon were cast into torments simultaneously. At length, they
						were “so tortured” that “authority ordered them” to be removed. Their
						sufferings were greater than the magistrates and people could longer endure
						to look upon. The question was put to Burroughs, “what he thought of these
						things.” He answered, “it was an amazing and humbling providence, but he
						understood nothing of it.” Throwing aside all the foolish and ridiculous
						gossip and all the monstrous fables that belong to the accusations against
						him, and looking at the only known facts in his history, it appears that Mr.
						Burroughs was a man of ingenuous nature, free from guile, unsuspicious of
						guile in <pb n="159" id="vII159"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2164">
							<figDesc>Page 159.</figDesc>
						</figure> others; a disinterested, humble, patient, and generous person. He
						had suffered much wrong, and endured great hardships in life; but they had
						not impaired his readiness to labor and suffer for others. There was no
						combativeness or vindictiveness in his disposition. Even in the midst of the
						unspeakable outrages he was experiencing on this occasion, he does not
						appear to be incensed or irritated, but simply “amazed.” To have such horrid
						crimes laid to him, instead of rousing a violent spirit within him,
						impressed him with a humbling sense of an inscrutable Providence. There is a
						remarkable similarity in the manner in which Rebecca Nurse and George
						Burroughs received the dreadful accusations brought against them. “Surely,”
						she said, “what sin hath God found out in me unrepented of that he should
						lay such an affliction upon me in my old age?” His words are, “It is an
						humbling providence of God.” The more we reflect upon this language, and go
						to the depths of the spirit that suggested it, the more we realize, that, in
						each case, it arose from a sanctified Christian heart, and is an attestation
						in vindication and in honor of the sufferers from whose lips it fell, that
						outweighs all passions and prejudices, reverses all verdicts, and commands
						the conviction of all fair and honest minds.</p>
					<p>After the “afflicted” had been sent out of the room, there was testimony to
						show that Mr. Burroughs had given proof of physical strength, which, in a
						man of his small stature, was sure evidence that he was in league with the
						Devil. Many marvellous statements <pb n="160" id="vII160"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2165">
							<figDesc>Page 160.</figDesc>
						</figure> were made to this effect, some of the most extravagant of which he
						denied. He undoubtedly was a person of great strength. He had cultivated
						muscular exercise and development while an undergraduate at Cambridge, and
						was early celebrated as a gymnast. After a while, the accusers and afflicted
						were again brought in. Abigail Hobbs testified that she was present at a
						“witch meeting, in the field near Mr. Parris's house,” in which Mr.
						Burroughs acted a conspicuous part. Mary Warren swore that “Mr. Burroughs
						had a trumpet which he blew to summon the witches to their feasts” and other
						meetings “near Mr. Parris's house.” This trumpet had a sound that reached
						over the country far and wide, sending its blasts to Andover, and wakening
						its echoes along the Merrimack, to Cape Ann, and the uttermost settlements
						everywhere; so that the witches, hearing it, would mount their brooms, and
						alight, in a moment, in Mr. Parris's orchard, just to the north and west of
						the parsonage; but its sound was not heard by any other ears than those of
						confederates with Satan. While the girls were giving their testimony, every
						once in a while they would be dreadfully choked, appearing to be in the last
						stages of suffocation and strangulation; and, coming to, at intervals, would
						charge it upon Burroughs or other witches, calling them by name; generally,
						however, confining their selection to persons already apprehended, and not
						bringing in others until measures were matured. Mr. Burroughs was committed
						for trial.</p>

						<figure id="Uphv2166">

					</p>
					<p>The examination of Mr. Burroughs presented a spectacle, all things
						considered, of rare interest and curiosity, — the grave dignity of the
						magistrates; the plain, dark figure of the prisoner; the half-crazed,
						halfdemoniac aspect of the girls; the wild, excited crowd; the horror, rage,
						and pallid exasperation of Lawson, Goodman Fuller and others, also of the
						relatives and friends of Burroughs's two former wives, as the deep damnation
						of their taking off and the secrets of their bloody graves were being
						brought to light; and the child on the stand telling her awful tale of
						ghosts in winding-sheets, with napkins round their heads, pointing to their
						death-wounds, and saying that “their blood did cry for vengeance” upon their
						murderer. The prisoner stands alone: all were raving around him, while he is
						amazed; astounded at such folly and wrong in others, and humbly sensible of
						his own unworthiness; bowed down under the mysterious Providence, that
						permitted such things for a season, yet strong and steadfast in conscious
						innocence and uprightness.</p>
					<p>To complete the proceedings against Burroughs at this time, and raise to the
						highest point the public abhorrence of him, effective use was made of
						Deliverance Hobbs, the wife of William Hobbs, of whom I have spoken before.
						She was first examined April 22. During the earlier part of the proceedings,
						she maintained her integrity and protested her innocence in a manner which
						shows that her self-possession held good. But the examination was
						protracted; her <pb n="162" id="vII162"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2167">
							<figDesc>Page 162.</figDesc>
						</figure> strength was exhausted; the declarations of the accusers, their
						dreadful sufferings, the prejudgment of the case against her by the
						magistrates, and the combined influences of all the circumstances around
						her, broke her down. Her firmness, courage, and truth fled; and she began to
						confess all that was laid to her charge. The record is interesting as
						showing how gradually she was overwhelmed and overcome. But while mentioning
						the names of others whom she pretended to have been associated with as
						witches, she did not speak of Burroughs. She referred to those who had been
						brought out before that date, but not to him. The intended movement against
						him had not then been divulged. On the 3d of May, the day before he arrived,
						after it was known that officers had been sent to arrest him, she was
						examined again. On this occasion, she charged Burroughs with having been
						present, and taken a leading part in witch-meetings, which she had described
						in detail, at her first examination, without mentioning him at all. This
						proves that the confessing prisoners were apprised of what it was desired
						they should say, and that their testimony was prepared for them by the
						managers of the affair. The following is one of the confessions made by this
						woman, subsequent to her public examination. I give it partly to show what a
						flood of falsehood was poured upon Burroughs, and partly because it will
						serve as a specimen of the stuff of which the confessions were composed:

					<p>On the next day, warrants were procured against George Jacobs, Sr., and his
						grand-daughter, Margaret Jacobs. They were forthwith seized and brought in
						by Constable Joseph Neal, of Salem, whose return is as follows: “May 10,
						1692. Then I apprehended the bodies of George Jacobs, Sr., and Margaret,
						daughter of George Jacobs, Jr., according to the tenor of the above
						warrant.” The examinations, on this occasion, were held at the house of
						Thomas Beadle, in the town of Salem. All the preliminary examinations, so
						far as existing documents show, were either in the meeting at the village or
						that of the town; or at the house of Nathaniel Ingersoll at the village, or
						Thomas Beadle in the town, — both being inns, or places of public
						entertainment. Beadle's house was on the south side of Essex Street, on land
						now occupied by Nos. 63 and 65. The eastern boundary of the lot was forty
						feet from Ingersoll's Lane, now Daniels Street. Its front on Essex Street
						was about sixty feet, and its depth about one hundred and forty-five feet.
						What is now No. 65 is on the very spot where Beadle's tavern stood; and with
						the exception of six feet built, as an addition, on the eastern side,
						subsequently to 1733, is probably the identical house. The ground now
						occupied by No. 63 was then an open space. It appears by bills of expenses
						brought “against the country,” that the inn of Samuel Beadle, a brother of
						Thomas, was also sometimes used for purposes connected with the
						prosecutions. Thomas Beadle's bill amounted to ¥58. 11<hi rend="italics"
							>s.</hi> 5<hi rend="italics">d.;</hi> that of Samuel to ¥21. The latter,
						being <pb n="165" id="vII165"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2170">
							<figDesc>Page 165.</figDesc>
						</figure> near the jail, was probably used for the entertainment of
						constables and the keeping of their horses, as well as other incidental
						purposes connected with the transportation of prisoners.</p>
					<p>A tradition has long prevailed, that the house, still standing, of Judge
						Jonathan Corwin, at the western corner of North and Essex Streets, was used
						at these examinations. One form in which this tradition has come down is
						probably correct. The grand jury was often in session while the jury for
						trials was hearing cases in the Court-house. There may not have been
						suitable accommodations for both in that building. The confused sounds and
						commotions incident to the trials would have been annoying to the grand
						jury. The tradition is, that a place was provided and used temporarily by
						that body, in the Corwin house, supposed to have been the spacious room at
						the southeastern corner. As the investigations of the grand jury were not
						open to the public, its occasional sittings would not be seriously
						incompatible with the convenience of a family, or detrimental to the grounds
						or apartments of a handsome private residence. Indeed, it would hardly have
						been allowable or practicable to have had the examinations before the
						magistrates in any other than a public house. They were always frequented by
						a promiscuous crowd, and generally scenes of tumultuary disorder.</p>
					<p>George Jacobs, Sr., was an aged man. He is represented in the evidence as
						“very gray-headed;” and he must have been quite infirm, for he walked with
						two <pb n="166" id="vII166"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2171">
							<figDesc>Page 166.</figDesc>
						</figure> staffs. His hair was in long, thin, white locks; and, as he was
						uncommonly tall of stature, he must have had a venerable aspect. Perhaps he
						was the “man in a long white hat,” referred to by Deliverance Hobbs. The
						examination shows that his faculties were vigorous, his bearing fearless,
						and his utterances strong and decided. The magistrates began: “Here are them
						that accuse you of acts of witchcraft.” — “Well, let us hear who are they
						and what are they.” When Abigail Williams testified against him, going
						through undoubtedly her usual operations, he could not refrain from
						expressing his contempt for the whole thing by a laugh; explaining it by
						saying, “Because I am falsely accused — your worships all of you, do you
						think this is true?” They answered, “Nay: what do you think?” “I never did
						it.” — “Who did it?” — “Don't ask me.” The magistrates always took it for
						granted that the pretensions and sufferings of the girls were real, and
						threw upon the accused the responsibility of explaining them. They
						continued: “Why should we not ask you? Sarah Churchill accuseth you. There
						she is.” Jacobs was of opinion that it was not for him to explain the
						actions of the girls, but for the prosecuting party to prove his guilt. “If
						you can prove that I am guilty, I will lie under it.” Then Sarah Churchill,
						who was a servant in his family, said, “Last night, I was afflicted at
						Deacon Ingersoll's; and Mary Walcot said it was a man with two staves: it
						was my master.” It seems, that, after the proceedings against Burroughs were
						over, a meeting of “the circle” took place in the <pb n="167" id="vII167"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2172">
							<figDesc>Page 167.</figDesc>
						</figure> evening, at Deacon Ingersoll's, at which there was a repetition of
						the actings of the girls; and that Mary Walcot suggested to Churchill to
						accuse her master. This shows the way in which the delusion was kept up.
						Probably, such meetings were held at one house or another in the village,
						and fresh accusations brought forward, continually. Jacobs appealed to the
						magistrates, trying to recall them to a sense of fairness. “Pray, do not
						accuse me: I am as clear as your worships. You must do right judgment.”
						Sarah Churchill charged him with having hurt her; and the magistrates,
						pushing her on to make further charges, said to her, “Did he not appear on
						the other side of the river, and hurt you? Did not you see him?” She
						answered, “Yes, he did.” Then, turning to him, the magistrates said, “There,
						she accuseth you to your face: she chargeth you that you hurt her twice.” —
						“It is not true. What would you have me say? I never wronged no man in word
						nor deed.” — “Is it no harm to afflict these?” — “I never did it.” — “But
						how comes it to be in your appearance?” — “The Devil can take any likeness.”
						— “Not without their consent.” Jacobs rejected the imputation. “You tax me
						for a wizard: you may as well tax me for a buzzard. I have done no harm.”
						Churchill said, “I know you lived a wicked life.” Jacobs, turning to the
						magistrates, said, “Let her make it out.” The magistrates asked her, “Doth
						he ever pray in his family?” She replied, “Not unless by himself.” The
						magistrates, addressing him: “Why do you not pray in your family?” — “I
						cannot <pb n="168" id="vII168"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2173">
							<figDesc>Page 168.</figDesc>
						</figure> read.” — “Well, but you may pray for all that. Can you say the
						Lord's Prayer? Let us hear you.” The reporter, Mr. Parris, says, “He missed
						in several parts of it, and could not repeat it right after many trials.”
						The magistrates, addressing her, said, “Were you not frighted, Sarah
						Churchill, when the representation of your master came to you?” — “Yes.”
						Jacobs exclaimed, “Well, burn me or hang me, I will stand in the truth of
						Christ: I know nothing of it.” In answer to an inquiry from the magistrates,
						he denied having done any thing to get his son George or grand Margaret to
						“sign the book.”</p>
					<p>The appearance of the old man, his intrepid bearing, and the stamp of
						conscious innocence on all he said, probably produced some impression on the
						magistrates, as they did not come to any decision, but adjourned the
						examination to the next day. The girls then came down from the village in
						full force, determined to put him through. When he was brought in, they
						accordingly, all at once, “fell into the most grievous fits and
						screechings.” When they sufficiently came to, the magistrates turned to the
						girls: “Is this the man that hurts you?” They severally answered, — Abigail
						Williams: “This is the man,” and fell into a violent fit. Ann Putnam: “This
						is the man. He hurts me, and brings the book to me, and would have me write
						in the book, and said, if I would write in it, I should be as well as his
						grand-daughter.” Mercy Lewis, after much interruptions by fits: “This is the
						man: he almost kills me.” Elizabeth Hubbard: “He <pb n="169" id="vII169"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2174">
							<figDesc>Page 169.</figDesc>
						</figure> never hurt me till to-day, when he came upon the table.” Mary
						Walcot, after much interruption by fits: “This is the man: he used to come
						with two staves, and beat me with one of them.” After all this, the
						magistrates, thinking he could deny it no longer, turn to him, “What do you
						say? Are you not a witch?” “No: I know it not, if I were to die presently.”
						Mercy Lewis advanced towards him, but, as soon as she got near, “fell into
						great fits.” — “What do you say to this?” cried the magistrates. “Why, it is
						false. I know not of it any more than the child that was born to-night.” The
						reporter says, “Ann Putnam and Abigail Williams had each of them a pin stuck
						in their hands, and they said it was this old Jacobs.” He was committed to
						prison.</p>

							she had undone herself. I asked her in what. She said, in belying
							herself and others in saying she had set her hand to the Devil's book,

							because they threatened her, and told her they would put her into the

							</figure> several times she followed me up and down, telling me that she
							had undone herself, in belying herself and others. I asked her why she
							did not deny she wrote it. She told me, because she had stood out so
							long in it, that now she durst not. She said also, that, if she told Mr.

						<p rend="right">“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sarah Ingersoll.</hi>”</p>
					</q>
					<p>This paper has also the signature of “Ann Andrews.”</p>
					<p>This incident probably occurred during the examination of George Jacobs; and
						the bitter compunction of Churchill was in consequence of the false and
						malignant course she had been pursuing against her old master. It is a
						relief to our feelings, so far as she is regarded, to suppose so. Bad as her
						conduct was as one of the accusers, on other occasions after I am sorry to
						say as well as before, it shows that she was not entirely dead to humanity,
						but realized the iniquity of which she had been guilty towards him. It is
						the only instance of which we find notice of any such a remnant of
						conscience showing itself, at the time, among those perverted and depraved
						young persons. The reason, why it is probable that this exhibition of
						Churchill's penitential tears and agonies of remorse occurred immediately
						after the first day of Jacobs's examination, is this. It was one of the
						first, if not the first, held at the house of Thomas Beadle. Sarah Ingersoll
						would not have been likely to have fallen in <pb n="171" id="vII171"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2176">
							<figDesc>Page 171.</figDesc>
						</figure> with her elsewhere. It is evident, from the tenor and purport of
						the document, that the deponent was not entirely carried away by the
						prevalent delusion, and probably did not follow up the proceedings
						generally. But it was quite natural that her attention should have been
						called to proceedings of interest at Beadle's house, particularly on that
						first occasion. She lived in the immediate vicinity. The indorsement by Ann
						Andrews, the daughter of Jacobs, increases the probability that the
						occurrence was at his examination.</p>
					<p>The representatives of the family of John Ingersoll, — a brother of Deacon
						Nathaniel Ingersoll, — in 1692, occupied a series of houses on the west side
						of Daniels Street, leading from Essex Street to the harbor. The widow of
						John's son Nathaniel lived at the corner of Essex and Daniels Streets; the
						next in order was the widow of his son John; the next, his daughter Ruth,
						wife of Richard Rose; the next, the widow of his son Richard; the last, his
						son Samuel, whose house lot extended to the water. Sarah, the witness in
						this case, was the wife of Samuel, and afterwards became the second wife of
						Philip English. One of her children appears to have married a son of Beadle.
						Their immediate proximity to the Beadle house, and consequent intimacy with
						his family, led them to become conversant with what occurred there; and
						Sarah Ingersoll was, in that way, likely to meet Churchill, and to have the
						conversation with her to which she deposes.</p>
					<p>This brief deposition of Sarah Ingersoll is, in many particulars, an
						important and instructive paper. It <pb n="172" id="vII172"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2177">
							<figDesc>Page 172.</figDesc>
						</figure> exhibits incidentally the means employed to keep the accusing
						girls and confessing witnesses from falling back, and, by overawing them, to
						prevent their acknowledging the falseness of their testimony. It shows how
						difficult it was to obtain a hearing, if they were disposed to recant. It
						presents Mr. Noyes — as all along there is too much evidence compelling us
						to admit — acting a part as bad as that of Parris; and it discloses the
						fact, that Mr. Burroughs, although not yet brought to trial, was immured in
						a dungeon.</p>
					<p>No papers are on file, or have been obtained, in reference to the examination
						of Margaret Jacobs, which was at the same time and place with that of her
						grandfather. We shall hear of her in subsequent stages of the
						transaction.</p>
					<p>On the same day — May 10 — that George and Margaret Jacobs were apprehended
						and examined, a warrant was issued against John Willard, “husbandman,” to be
						brought to Thomas Beadle's house in Salem. On the 12th, John Putnam, Jr.,
						constable, made return that he had been to “the house of the usual abode of
						John Willard, and made search for him, and in several other houses and
						places, but could not find him;” and that “his relations and friends” said,
						“that, to their best knowledge, he was fled.” On the 15th, a warrant was
						issued to the marshal of Essex, and the constables of Salem, “or any other
						marshal, or marshal's constable or constables within this their majesty's
						colony or territory of the Massachusetts, in New England,” requiring them to
						apprehend said Willard, “if he may be found <pb n="173" id="vII173"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2178">
							<figDesc>Page 173.</figDesc>
						</figure> in your precincts, who stands charged with sundry acts of
						witchcraft, by him done or committed on the bodies of Bray Wilkins, and
						Samuel Wilkins, the son of Henry Wilkins,” and others, upon complaint made
						“by Thomas Fuller, Jr., and Benjamin Wilkins, Sr., yeomen; who, being found,
						you are to convey from town to town, from constable to constable,... to be
						prosecuted according to the direction of Constable John Putnam, of Salem
						Village, who goes with the same.” On the 18th of May, Constable Putnam
						brought in Willard, and delivered him to the magistrates. He was seized in
						Groton. There is no record of his examination; but we gather, from the
						papers on file, the following facts relating to this interesting case: —</p>
					<p>It is said that Willard had been called upon to aid in the arrest, custody,
						and bringing-in of persons accused, acting as a deputy-constable; and, from
						his observation of the deportment of the prisoners, and from all he heard
						and saw, his sympathies became excited in their behalf: and he expressed, in
						more or less unguarded terms, his disapprobation of the proceedings. He
						seems to have considered all hands concerned in the business — accusers,
						accused, magistrates, and people — as alike bewitched. One of the witnesses
						against him deposed, that he said, in a “discourse” at the house of a
						relative, “Hang them: they are all witches.” In consequence of this kind of
						talk, in which he indulged as early as April, he incurred the ill-will of
						the parties engaged in the prose <pb n="174" id="vII174"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2179">
							<figDesc>Page 174.</figDesc>
						</figure> cutions; and it was whispered about that he was himself in the
						diabolical confederacy. He was a grandson of Bray Wilkins; and the mind of
						the old man became prejudiced against him, and most of his family
						connections and neighbors partook of the feeling. When Willard discovered
						that such rumors were in circulation against him, he went to his grandfather
						for counsel and the aid of his prayers. He met with a cold reception, as
						appears by the deposition of the old man as follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“When John Willard was first complained of by the afflicted persons for
							afflicting of them, he came to my house, greatly troubled, desiring me,
							with some other neighbors, to pray for him. I told him I was then going
							from home, and could not stay; but, if I could come home before night, I
							should not be unwilling. But it was near night before I came home, and
							so I did not answer his desire; but I heard no more of him upon that
							account. Whether my not answering his desire did not offend him, I
							cannot tell; but I was jealous, afterwards, that it did.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Willard soon after made an engagement to go to Boston, on election-week, with
						Henry Wilkins, Jr. A son of said Henry Wilkins, named Daniel, — a youth of
						seventeen years of age, who had heard the stories against Willard, and
						believed them all, remonstrated with his father against going to Boston with
						Willard, and seemed much distressed at the thought, saying, among other
						things, “It were well if the said Willard were hanged.”</p>
					<p>Old Bray Wilkins must go to election too; and so <pb n="175" id="vII175"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2180">
							<figDesc>Page 175.</figDesc>
						</figure> started off on horseback, — the only mode of travel then
						practicable from Will's Hill to Winnesimit Ferry, —with his wife on a
						pillion behind him. He was eightytwo years of age, and she probably not much
						less; for she had been the wife of his youth. The old couple undoubtedly had
						an active time that week in Boston. It was a great occasion, and the whole
						country flocked in to partake in the ceremonies and services of the
						anniversary. On Election-day, with his wife, he rode out to Dorchester, to
						dine at the house of his “brother, Lieutenant Richard Way.” Deodat Lawson
						and his new wife, and several more, joined them at table. Before sitting
						down, Henry Wilkins and John Willard also came in. Willard, perhaps, did not
						feel very agreeably towards his grandfather, at the time, for having shown
						an unwillingness to pray with him. The old man either saw, or imagined he
						saw, a very unpleasant expression in Willard's countenance. “To my
						apprehension, he looked after such a sort upon me as I never before
						discerned in any.” The long and hard travel, the fatigues and excitements of
						election, were too much for the old man, tough and rugged as he was; and a
						severe attack of a complaint, to which persons of his age are often subject,
						came on. He experienced great sufferings, and, as he expressed it, “was like
						a man on a rack.”</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“I told my wife immediately that I was afraid that Willard had done me
							wrong; my pain continuing, and finding no relief, my jealousy continued.
							Mr. Lawson and others there were all amazed, and knew not what to do for
							me. There was <pb n="176" id="vII176"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2181">
								<figDesc>Page 176.</figDesc>
							</figure> a woman accounted skilful came hoping to help me, and after
							she had used means, she asked me whether none of those evil persons had
							done me damage. I said, I could not say they had, but I was sore afraid
							they had. She answered, she did fear so too.... As near as I remember. I
							lay in this case three or four days at Boston, and afterward, with the
							jeopardy of my life (as I thought), I came home.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>On his return, he found his grandson, the same Daniel who had warned Henry
						Wilkins against going to Boston with John Willard, on his death - bed, in
						great suffering. Another attack of his own malady came on. There was great
						consternation in the neighborhood, and throughout the village. The Devil and
						his confederates, it was thought, were making an awful onslaught upon the
						people at Will's Hill. Parris and others rushed to the scene. Mercy Lewis
						and Mary Walcot were carried up to tell who it was that was bewitching old
						Bray, and young Daniel, and others of the Wilkinses who had caught the
						contagion, and were experiencing or imagining all sorts of bodily ails. They
						were taken to the room where Daniel was approaching his death-agonies; and
						they both affirmed, that they saw the spectres of old Mrs. Buckley and John
						Willard “upon his throat and upon his breast, and pressed him and choked
						him;” and the cruel operation, they insisted upon it, continued until the
						boy died. The girls were carried to the bedroom of the old man, who was in
						great suffering; and, when they entered, the question was put by the anxious
						and excited friends in the chamber to Mercy Lewis, whether <pb n="177"
							id="vII177"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2182">
							<figDesc>Page 177.</figDesc>
						</figure> she saw any thing. She said, “Yes: they are looking for John
						Willard.” Presently she pretended to have caught sight of his apparition,
						and exclaimed, “There he is upon his grandfather's belly.” This was thought
						wonderful indeed; for, as the old man says in a deposition he drew up
						afterwards, “At that time I was in grievous pain in the small of my
						belly.”</p>
					<p>Mrs. Ann Putnam had her story to tell about John Willard. Its substance is
						seen in a deposition drawn up about the time, and is in the same vein as her
						testimony in other cases; presenting a problem to be solved by those who can
						draw the line between semi-insane hallucination and downright fabrication.
						Her deposition is as follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“That the shape of Samuel Fuller and Lydia Wilkins this day told me at my
							own house by the bedside, who appeared in winding-sheets, that, if I did
							not go and tell Mr. Hathorne that John Willard had murdered them, they
							would tear me to pieces. I knew them when they were living, and it was
							exactly their resemblance and shape. And, at the same time, the
							apparition of John Willard told me that he had killed Samuel Fuller,
							Lydia Wilkins, Goody Shaw, and Fuller's second wife, and Aaron Way's
							child, and Ben Fuller's child; and this deponent's child Sarah, six
							weeks old; and Philip Knight's child, with the help of William Hobbs;
							and Jonathan Knight's child and two of Ezekiel Cheever's children with
							the help of William Hobbs; Anne Eliot and Isaac Nichols with the help of
							William Hobbs; and that if Mr. Hathorne would not believe them, — that
							is, Samuel Fuller and Lydia Wilkins, — perhaps they would appear to <pb
								n="178" id="vII178"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2183">
								<figDesc>Page 178.</figDesc>
							</figure> the magistrates. Joseph Fuller's apparition the same day also
							came to me, and told me that Goody Corey had killed him. The spectre
							aforesaid told me, that vengeance, vengeance, was cried by said Fuller.
							This relation is true.</p>
						<p rend="right">“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ann Putnam.</hi>”</p>
					</q>
					<p>It appears by such papers as are to be found relating to Willard's case, that
						a coroner's jury was held over the body of Daniel Wilkins, of which
						Nathaniel Putnam was foreman. It is much to be regretted that the finding of
						that jury is lost. It would be a real curiosity. That it was very decisive
						to the point, affirmed by Mercy Lewis and Mary Walcot, that Daniel was
						choked and strangled by the spectres of John Willard and Goody Buckley, is
						apparent from the manner in which Bray Wilkins speaks of it. In an argument
						between him and some persons who were expressing their confidence that John
						Willard was an innocent man, he sought to relieve himself from
						responsibility for Willard's conviction by saying, “It was not I, nor my son
						Benjamin Wilkins, but the testimony of the afflicted persons, and the jury
						concerning the murder of my grandson, Daniel Wilkins, that would take away
						his life, if any thing did.” Mr. Parris, of course, was in the midst of
						these proceedings at Will's Hill; attended the visits of the afflicted girls
						when they went to ascertain who were the witches murdering young Daniel and
						torturing the old man; was present, no doubt, at the solemn examinations and
						investigations of the sages who sat as a jury of inquest <pb n="179"
							id="vII179"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2184">
							<figDesc>Page 179.</figDesc>
						</figure> over the former, and, in all likelihood, made, as usual, a written
						report of the same. As soon as he got back to his house, he discharged his
						mind, and indorsed the verdict of the coroner's jury by this characteristic
						insertion in his church-records: “Dan: Wilkins. Bewitched to death.” The
						very next entry relates to a case of which this obituary line, in Mr.
						Parris's church-book, is the only intimation that has come down to us,
						“Daughter to Ann Douglas. By witchcraft, I doubt not.” Willard's examination
						was at Beadle's, on the 18th. With this deluge of accusations and tempest of
						indignation beating upon him, he had but little chance, and was
						committed.</p>
					<p>While the marshals and constables were in pursuit of Willard, the time was
						well improved by the prosecutors. On the 12th of May, warrants were issued
						to apprehend, and bring “forthwith” before the magistrates sitting at
						Beadle's, “Alice Parker, the wife of John Parker of Salem; and Ann Pudeator
						of Salem, widow.” Alice, commonly called Elsie, Parker was the wife of a
						mariner. We know but little of her. We have a deposition of one woman,
						Martha Dutch, as follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“This deponent testified and saith, that, about two years last past, John
							Jarman, of Salem, coming in from sea, I (this deponent and Alice Parker,
							of Salem, both of us standing together) said unto her, `What a great
							mercy it was, for to see them come home well; and through mercy,' I
							said, `my husband had gone, and come home well, many times.' And I, this
							deponent, did say unto the said Parker, that `I <pb n="180" id="vII180"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2185">
								<figDesc>Page 180.</figDesc>
							</figure> did hope he would come home this voyage well also.' And the
							said Parker made answer unto me, and said, `No: never more in this
							world.' The which came to pass as she then told me; for he died abroad,
							as I certainly hear.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Perhaps Parker had information which had not reached the ears of Dutch, or
						she may have been prone to take melancholy views of the dangers to which
						seafaring people are exposed. It was a strange kind of evidence to be
						admitted against a person in a trial for witchcraft.</p>
					<p>Samuel Shattuck, who has been mentioned (vol. i. p. 193) in connection with
						Bridget Bishop, had a long story to tell about Alice Parker. He seems to
						have been very active in getting up charges of witchcraft against persons in
						his neighborhood, and on the most absurd and frivolous grounds. Parker had
						made a friendly call upon his wife; and, not long after, one of his children
						fell sick, and he undertook to suspect that it was “under an evil hand.” In
						similar circumstances, he took the same grudge against Bridget Bishop. Alice
						Parker, hearing that he had been circulating suspicions to that effect
						against her, went to his house to remonstrate; an angry altercation took
						place between them; and he gave his version of the affair in evidence. There
						was no one to present the other side. But the whole thing has, not only a
						one-sided, but an irrelevant character, in no wise bearing upon the point of
						witchcraft. All the gossip, scandal, and tittle-tattle of the neighborhood
						for twenty years back, in this case as in others, was <pb n="181"
							id="vII181"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2186">
							<figDesc>Page 181.</figDesc>
						</figure> raked up, and allowed to be adduced, however utterly remote from
						the questions belonging to the trial.</p>
					<p>The following singular piece of testimony against Alice Parker may be
						mentioned. John Westgate was at Samuel Beadle's tavern one night with boon
						companions; among them John Parker, the husband of Alice. She disapproved of
						her husband's spending his evenings in such company, and in a bar-room; and
						felt it necessary to put a stop to it, if she could. Westgate says that she
						“came into the company, and scolded at and called her husband all to nought;
						whereupon I, the said deponent, took her husband's part, telling her it was
						an unbeseeming thing for her to come after him to the tavern, and rail after
						that rate. With that she came up to me, and called me rogue, and bid me mind
						my own business, and told me I had better have said nothing.” He goes on to
						state, that, returning home one night some time afterwards, he experienced
						an awful fright. “Going from the house of Mr. Daniel King, when I came over
						against John Robinson's house, I heard a great noise;... and there appeared
						a black hog running towards me with open mouth, as though he would have
						devoured me at that instant time.” In the extremity of his terror, he tried
						to run away from the awful monster; but, as might have been expected under
						the circumstances, he tumbled to the ground. “I fell down upon my hip, and
						my knife run into my hip up to the haft. When I came home, my knife was in
						my sheath. When I drew it out of the sheath, then immediately the sheath
						fell all <pb n="182" id="vII182"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2187">
							<figDesc>Page 182.</figDesc>
						</figure> to pieces.” And further this deponent testifieth, that, after he
						got up from his fall, his stocking and shoe was full of blood, and that he
						was forced to crawl along by the fence all the way home; and the hog
						followed him, and never left him till he came home. He further stated that
						he was accompanied all the way by his “stout dog,” which ordinarily was much
						inclined to attack and “worry hogs,” but, on this occasion, “ran away from
						him, leaping over the fence and crying much.” In view of all these things,
						Westgate concludes his testimony thus: “Which hog I then apprehended was
						either the Devil or some evil thing, not a real hog; and did then really
						judge, or determine in my mind, that it was either Goody Parker or by her
						means and procuring, fearing that she is a witch.” The facts were probably
						these: The sheath was broken by his fall, his skin bruised, and some blood
						got into his stocking and shoe. The knife was never out of the sheath until
						he drew it; there was no mystery or witchcraft in it. Nothing was ever more
						natural than the conduct of the dog. When he saw Westgate frightened out of
						his wits at nothing, trying to run as for dear life when there was no
						pursuer, staggering and pitching along in a zigzag direction with very
						eccentric motions, falling heels over head, and then crawling along, holding
						himself up by the fence, and all the time looking back with terror, and
						perhaps attempting to express his consternation, the dog could not tell what
						to make of it; and ran off, as a dog would be likely to have done, jumping
						over the fences, barking, <pb n="183" id="vII183"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2188">
							<figDesc>Page 183.</figDesc>
						</figure> and uttering the usual canine ejaculations. Dogs sympathize with
						their masters, and, if there is a frolic or other acting going on, are fond
						of joining in it. The whole thing was in consequence of Westgate's not
						having profited by Alice Parker's rebuke, and discontinued his visits by
						night to Beadle's bar-room. The only reason why he saw the “black hog with
						the open mouth,” and the dog did not see it, and therefore failed to come to
						his protection, was because he had been drinking and the dog had not.</p>
					<p>We find among the papers relating to these transactions many other instances
						of this kind of testimony; sounds heard and sights seen by persons going
						home at night through woods, after having spent the evening under the
						bewildering influences of talk about witches, Satan, ghosts, and spectres;
						sometimes, as in this case, stimulated by other causes of excitement.</p>
					<p>Perhaps some persons may be curious to know the route by which Westgate made
						out to reach his home, while pursued by the horrors of that midnight
						experience. He seems to have frequented Samuel Beadle's bar-room. That old
						Narragansett soldier owned a lot on the west side of St. Peter's Street,
						occupying the southern corner of what is now Church Street, which was opened
						ten years afterwards, that is, in 1702, by the name of Epps's Lane. On that
						lot his tavern stood. He also owned one-third of an acre at the present
						corner of Brown and St. Peter's Streets, on which he had a stable and barn;
						so that his grounds were on both sides of St. Peter's Street, — one parcel
						on the west, <pb n="184" id="vII184"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2189">
							<figDesc>Page 184.</figDesc>
						</figure> nearly opposite the present front of the church; the other on the
						east side of St. Peter's Street, opposite the south side of the church. From
						this locality Westgate started. He probably did not go down Brown Street,
						for that was then a dark, unfrequented lane, but thought it safest to get
						into Essex Street. He made his way along that street, passing the Common,
						the southern side of which, at that time, with the exception of some
						house-lots on and contiguous to the site of the Franklin Building, bordered
						on Essex Street. The casualty of his fall; the catastrophe to his hip,
						stocking, and shoe; and the witchery practised upon his knife and its
						sheath, — occurred “over against John Robinson's house,” which was on the
						eastern corner of Pleasant and Essex Streets. Christopher Babbage's house,
						from which he thought the “great noise” came, was next beyond Robinson's. He
						crawled along the fences and the sides of the houses until he reached the
						passage-way on the western side of Thomas Beadle's house, and through that
						managed to get to his own house, which was directly south of said Beadle
						lot, between it and the harbor.</p>
					<p>There is one item in reference to Alice Parker, which indicates that the zeal
						of the prosecutors in her case, as in that of Mr. Burroughs, and perhaps
						others, was aggravated by a suspicion that she was heretical on some points
						of the prevalent creed of the day. Parris says that “Mr. Noyes, at the time
						of her examination, affirmed to her face, that, he being with her at a time
						of sickness, discoursing with her about <pb n="185" id="vII185"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2190">
							<figDesc>Page 185.</figDesc>
						</figure> witchcraft, whether she were not guilty, she answered, `if she was
						as free from other sins as from witchcraft, she would not ask of the Lord
						mercy.”' The manner of expression in this passage shows that it was thought
						that there was something very shocking in her answer. Mr. Noyes “affirmed to
						her face.” No doubt it was thought that she denied the doctrine of original
						and transmitted, or imputed sin.</p>
					<p>Ann Pudeator (pronounced Pud-e-tor) was the widow of Jacob Pudeator, and
						probably about seventy years of age. The name is spelt variously, and was
						originally, as it is sometimes found, Poindexter. She was a woman of
						property, owning two estates on the north line of the Common; that on which
						she lived comprised what is between Oliver and Winter Streets. She was
						arrested and brought to examination on the 12th of May. There is ground to
						conclude, from the tenor of the documents, that she was then discharged.
						Some people in the town were determined to gratify their spleen against her,
						and procured her re-arrest. The examination took place on the 2d of July,
						and she was then committed. The evidence was, if possible, more frivolous
						and absurd than in other cases. The girls acted their usual parts, giving,
						on this occasion, a particularly striking exhibition of the transmission of
						the diabolical virus out of themselves back into the witch by a touch of her
						body. “Ann Putnam fell into a fit, and said Pudeator was commanded to take
						her by the wrist, and did; and said Putnam was well presently. Mary Warren
						fell into two fits quickly, after <pb n="186" id="vII186"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2191">
							<figDesc>Page 186.</figDesc>
						</figure> one another; and both times was helped by said Pudeator's taking
						her by the wrist.”</p>
					<p>When well acted, this must have been one of the most impressive and effective
						of all the methods employed in these performances. To see a young woman or
						girl suddenly struck down, speechless, pallid as in death; with muscles
						rigid, eyeballs fixed or rolled back in their sockets; the stiffened frame
						either wholly prostrate or drawn up into contorted attitudes and shapes, or
						vehemently convulsed with racking pains, or dropping with relaxed muscles
						into a lifeless lump; and to hear dread shrieks of delirious ravings, — must
						have produced a truly frightful effect upon an excited and deluded assembly.
						The constables and their assistants would go to the rescue, lift the body of
						the sufferer, and bear it in their arms towards the prisoner. The
						magistrates and the crowd, hushed in the deepest silence, would watch with
						breathless awe the result of the experiment, while the officers slowly
						approached the accused, who, when they came near, would, in obedience to the
						order of the magistrates, hold out a hand, and touch the flesh of the
						afflicted one. Instantly the spasms cease, the eyes open, color returns to
						the countenance, the limbs resume their position and functions, and life and
						intelligence are wholly restored. The sufferer comes to herself, walks back,
						and takes her seat as well as ever. The effect upon the accused person must
						have been confounding. It is a wonder that it did not oftener break them
						down. It sometimes did. Poor Deliverance Hobbs, when the <pb n="187"

						<figure id="Uphv2192">
							<figDesc>Page 187.</figDesc>
						</figure> process was tried upon her, was wholly overcome, and passed from
						conscious and calmly asserted innocence to a helpless abandonment of reason,
						conscience, and herself, exclaiming, “I am amazed! I am amazed!” and
						assented afterwards to every charge brought against her, and said whatever
						she was told, or supposed they wished her to say.</p>
					<p>On the 14th of May, warrants were issued against Daniel Andrew; George
						Jacobs, Jr.; his wife, Rebecca Jacobs; Sarah Buckley, wife of William
						Buckley; and Mary Whittredge, daughter of said Buckley, — all of Salem
						Village; Elizabeth Hart, wife of Isaac Hart, of Lynn; Thomas Farrar, Sr.,
						also of Lynn; Elizabeth Colson, of Reading; and Bethiah Carter, of Woburn.
						There is nothing of special interest among the few papers that are on file
						relating to Hart, Colson, or Carter. The constable made return that he had
						searched the houses of Daniel Andrew and George Jacobs, Jr., but could not
						find them. He brought in forthwith the bodies of Sarah Buckley, Mary
						Whittredge, and Rebecca Jacobs. Farrar and the rest were brought in shortly
						afterwards.</p>
					<p>Daniel Andrew was one of the leading men of the village, and the warrant
						against him was proof that soon none would be too high to be reached by the
						prosecutors. He felt that it was in vain to attempt to resist their
						destructive power; and, getting notice in some way of the approach of the
						constable, with his near neighbor, friend, and connection, George Jacobs,
							<pb n="188" id="vII188"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2193">
							<figDesc>Page 188.</figDesc>
						</figure> Jr., effected his escape, and found refuge in a foreign
						country.</p>
					<p>Rebecca, the wife of George Jacobs, Jr., was the victim of a partial
						derangement. Her daughter Margaret was already in jail. Her husband had
						escaped by a hurried flight, and his father was in prison awaiting his
						trial. She was left in a lonely and unprotected condition, in a country but
						thinly settled, in the midst of woods. The constable came with his warrant
						for her. She was driven to desperation, and was inclined to resist; but he
						persuaded her to go with him by holding out the inducement that she would
						soon be permitted to return. Four young children, one of them an infant,
						were left in the house; but those who were old enough to walk followed
						after, crying, endeavoring to overtake her. Some of the neighbors took them
						into their houses. The imprisonment of a woman in her situation and mental
						condition was an outrage; but she was kept in irons, as they all were, for
						eight months. Her mother addressed an humble but earnest and touching
						petition to the chief-justice of the court at Salem, setting forth her
						daughter's condition; but it was of no avail. Afterwards, she addressed a
						similar memorial to “His Excellency Sir William Phips, Knight, Governor, and
						the Honorable Council sitting at Boston,” in the following terms: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="italics">The Humble Petition of Rebecca Fox, of Cambridge,

					<p>No heed was paid to this petition; and the unfortunate woman remained in jail
						until — after the delusion had passed from the minds of the people — a grand
						jury found a bill against her, on which she was brought to trial, Jan. 3,
						1693, and acquitted. There is no more disgraceful feature in all the
						proceedings than the long imprisonment of this woman, her being brought to
						trial, and the obdurate deafness to humanity and reason of the
						chief-justice, the governor, and the council.</p>
					<p>No papers are found relating to the examination of Thomas Farrar; but the

						<p>“We, whose names are underwritten, having been conversant with Ann
							Putnam, have heard her declare what is above written, — what she said

					<p>She had heard this person spoken of as “old Father Pharaoh,” with his “great

						cried out upon him. Many of the documents exhibit a levity of spirit among

					</q>
					<p>Sarah Buckley was examined May 18, and her daughter Mary Whittredge probably
						on the same day. We have Parris's report of the proceedings in reference to
						the former. The only witnesses against her were the afflicted children. They
						performed their grand operation of going into fits, and being carried to the
						accused and subjected to her touch; Ann Putnam, Susanna Sheldon, and Mary
						Warren enacting the part in succession. Sheldon cried out, “There is the
						black man whispering in her ear!” The magistrates and all beholders were
						convinced. She was committed to prison, and remained in irons for eight
						months before a trial, which resulted in her acquittal. So eminently
						excellent was the character of Goodwife Buckley, that her arrest and
						imprisonment led to expressions in her favor as honorable to those who had
						the courage to utter them as to her. The following certificates were given,
						previous to her trial, by ministers in the neighborhood: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“These are to certify whom it may or shall concern, that I have known

							Ipswich above forty years since; and that I never heard from others, or
							observed by myself, any thing of her that was inconsistent with her
							profession or unsuitable to Christianity, either in word, deed, or
							conversation, and am strangely surprised that any person should speak or

						<p>“Being desired by Goodman Buckley to give my testimony to his wife's

							Salem for many years in communion with this church, having occasionally
							frequent converse and discourse with her, I have never observed myself,
							nor heard from any other, any thing that was unsuitable to a
							conversation becoming the gospel, and have always looked upon her as a

						<p rend="right">“<hi rend="smallcaps">John Higginson.</hi>”</p>
						<p>“Marblehead, Jan. 2, 169⅔. — Upon the same request, having had the like

							than give the alike testimony for her pious conversation during her
							abode in this place and communion with us. <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel
								Cheever.</hi>”</p>
					</q>
					<p>William Hubbard was the venerable minister of Ipswich, described by
						Hutchinson as “a man of learning, <pb n="194" id="vII194"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2199">
							<figDesc>Page 194.</figDesc>
						</figure> and of a candid and benevolent mind, accompanied with a good
						degree of catholicism.” He is described by another writer as “a man of
						singular modesty, learned without ostentation.” He will be remembered with
						honor for his long and devoted service in the Christian ministry, and as the
						historian of New England and of the Indian wars.</p>
					<p>John Higginson was worthy of the title of the “Nestor of the New-England
						clergy.” He was at this time seventy-six years old, and had been a preacher
						of the gospel fifty-five years. For thirty-three years he had been pastor of
						the First Church in Salem, of which his father was the first preacher. No
						character, in all our annals, shines with a purer lustre. John Dunton
						visited him in 1686, and thus speaks of him: “All men look to him as a
						common father; and old age, for his sake, is a reverend thing. He is eminent
						for all the graces that adorn a minister. His very presence puts vice out of
						countenance; his conversation is a glimpse of heaven.” The fact, that, while
						his colleague, Nicholas Noyes, took so active and disastrous a part in the
						prosecutions, he, at an early stage, discountenanced them, shows that he was
						a person of discrimination and integrity. That he did not conceal his
						disapprobation of the proceedings is demonstrated, not only by the tenor of
						his attestation in behalf of Goodwife Buckley, but by the decisive
						circumstance that the “afflicted children” cried out against his daughter
						Anna, the wife of Captain William Dolliver, of Gloucester; got a warrant to
						apprehend her; and <pb n="195" id="vII195"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2200">
							<figDesc>Page 195.</figDesc>
						</figure> had her brought to the Salem jail, and committed as a witch. They
						never struck at friends, but were sure to punish all who were suspected to
						disapprove of the proceedings. How long Mrs. Dolliver remained in prison we
						are not informed. But it was impossible to break down the influence or
						independence of Mr. Higginson. It is not improbable that he believed in
						witchcraft, with all the other divines of his day; but he feared not to bear
						testimony to personal worth, and could not be brought to co-operate in
						violence, or fall in with the spirit of persecution. The weight of his
						character compelled the deference of the most heated zealots, and even
						Cotton Mather himself was eager to pay him homage. Four years afterwards, he
						thus writes of him: “This good old man is yet alive; and he that, from a
						child, knew the Holy Scriptures, does, at those years wherein men use to be
						twice children, continue preaching them with such a manly, pertinent, and
						judicious vigor, and with so little decay of his intellectual abilities, as
						is indeed a matter of just admiration.”</p>
					<p>Samuel Cheever was a clergyman of the highest standing, and held in universal
						esteem through a long life.</p>
					<p>From passages incidentally given, it has appeared that it was quite common,
						in those times, to attribute accidents, injuries, pains, and diseases of all
						kinds, to an “evil hand.” It was not confined to this locality. When,
						however, the public mind had become excited to so extraordinary a degree by
						circumstances connected <pb n="196" id="vII196"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2201">
							<figDesc>Page 196.</figDesc>
						</figure> with the prosecutions in 1692, this tendency of the popular
						credulity was very much strengthened. Believing that the sufferer or patient
						was the victim of the malignity of Satan, and it also being a doctrine of
						the established belief that he could not act upon human beings or affairs
						except through the instrumental agency of some other human beings in
						confederacy with him, the question naturally arose, in every specific
						instance, Who is the person in this diabolical league, and doing the will of
						the Devil in this case? Who is the witch? It may well be supposed, that the
						suffering person, and all surrounding friends, would be most earnest and
						anxious in pressing this question and seeking its solution. The accusing
						girls at the village were thought to possess the power to answer it. This
						gave them great importance, gratified their vanity and pride, and exalted
						them to the character of prophetesses. They were ready to meet the calls
						made upon them in this capacity; would be carried to the room of a sick
						person; and, on entering it, would exclaim, on the first return of pain, or
						difficulty of respiration, or restless motion of the patient, “There she
						is!” There is such a one's appearance, choking or otherwise tormenting him
						or her. If the minds of the accusing girls had been led towards a new
						victim, his or her name would be used, and a warrant issued for his
						apprehension. If not, then the name of some one already in confinement would
						be used on the occasion. It was also a received opinion, that, while
						ordinary fastenings would not prevent a <pb n="197" id="vII197"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2202">
							<figDesc>Page 197.</figDesc>
						</figure> witch from going abroad, “in her apparition,” to any distance to
						afflict persons, a redoubling of them might. Whenever one of the accusing
						girls pretended to see the spectres of persons already in jail afflicting
						any one, orders would forthwith be given to have them more heavily chained.
						Every once in a while, a wretched prisoner, already suffering from bonds and
						handcuffs, would be subjected to additional manacles and chains. This was
						one of the most cruel features in these proceedings. It is illustrated by
						the following document: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Benjamin Hutchinson,</hi> who
							testifleth and saith, that my wife was much afflicted, presently after
							the last execution, with violent pains in her head and teeth, and all
							parts of her body; but, on sabbath day was fortnight in the morning, she
							being in such excessive misery that she said she believed that she had
							an evil hand upon her: whereupon I went to Mary Walcot, one of our next
							neighbors, to come and look to see if she could see anybody upon her;
							and, as soon as she came into the house, she said that our two next
							neighbors, Sarah Buckley and Mary Whittredge, were upon my wife. And
							immediately my wife had ease, and Mary Walcot was tormented. Whereupon I
							went down to the sheriff, and desired him to take some course with those
							women, that they might not have such power to torment: and presently he
							ordered them to be fettered, and, ever since that, my wife has been
							tolerable well; and I believe, in my heart, that Sarah Buckley and Mary
							Whittredge have hurt my wife and several others by acts of
							witchcraft.</p>
						<p>“Benjamin Hutchinson owned the above-written evidence <pb n="198"
								id="vII198"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2203">
								<figDesc>Page 198.</figDesc>
							</figure> to be the truth, upon oath, before the grand inquest, 15-7,
							1692.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>The evidence is quite conclusive, from considerations suggested by the
						foregoing document, and indications scattered through the papers generally,
						that all persons committed on the charge of witchcraft were kept heavily
						ironed, and otherwise strongly fastened. Only a few of the bills of expenses
						incurred are preserved. Among them we find the following: For mending and
						putting on Rachel Clenton's fetters; one pair of fetters for John Howard; a
						pair of fetters each for John Jackson, Sr., and John Jackson, Jr.; eighteen
						pounds of iron for fetters; for making four pair of iron fetters and two
						pair of handcuffs, and putting them on the legs and hands of Goodwife
						Cloyse, Easty, Bromidg, and Green; chains for Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn;
						shackles for ten prisoners; and one pair of irons for Mary Cox. When we
						reflect upon the character of the prisoners generally, — many of them
						delicate and infirm, several venerable for their virtues as well as years, —
						and that they were kept in this cruelly painful condition from early spring
						to the middle of the next January, and the larger part to the May of 1693,
						in the extremes of heat and cold, exposed to the most distressing severities
						of both, crowded in narrow, dark, and noisome jails under an accumulation of
						all their discomforts, restraints, privations, exposures, and abominations,
						our wonder is, not that many of them died, but that all did not break down
						in body and mind.</p>

					</p>
					<p>Sarah Buckley and her daughter were not brought to trial until after the
						power of the prosecution to pursue to the death had ceased. They were
						acquitted in January, 1692. Their goods and chattels had all been seized by
						the officers, as was the usual practice, at the time of their arrest. In
						humble circumstances before, it took their last shilling to meet the charges
						of their imprisonment. They, as all others, were required to provide their
						own maintenance while in prison; and, after trial and acquittal, were not
						discharged until all costs were paid. Five pounds had to be raised, to
						satisfy the claims of the officers of the court and of the jails, for each
						of them. The result was, the family was utterly impoverished. The poor old
						woman, with her aged husband, suffered much, there is reason to fear, from
						absolute want during all the rest of their days. Their truly Christian
						virtues dignified their poverty, and secured the respect and esteem of all
						good men. The Rev. Joseph Green has this entry in his diary: “Jan. 2, 1702.
						— Old William Buckley died this evening. He was at meeting the last sabbath,
						and died with the cold, I fear, for want of comforts and good tending. Lord
						forgive! He was about eighty years old. I visited him and prayed with him on
						Monday, and also the evening before he died. He was very poor; but, I hope,
						had not his portion in this life.” The ejaculation, “Lord forgive!”
						expresses the deep sense Mr. Green had, of which his whole ministry gave
						evidence, of the inexpressible sufferings and wrongs brought upon families
							<pb n="200" id="vII200"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2205">
							<figDesc>Page 200.</figDesc>
						</figure> by the witchcraft prosecutions. The case of Sarah Buckley, her
						husband and family, was but one of many. The humble, harmless, innocent
						people who experienced that fearful and pitiless persecution had to drink of
						as bitter a cup as ever was permitted by an inscrutable Providence to be
						presented to human lips. In reference to them, we feel as an assurance, what
						good Mr. Green humbly hoped, that “they had not their portion in this life.”
						Those who went firmly, patiently, and calmly through that great trial
						without losing love or faith, are crowned with glory and honor.</p>
					<p>The examination and commitment of Mary Easty, on the 21st of April, have
						already been described. For some reason, and in a way of which we have no
						information, she was diseharged from prison on the 18th of May, and wholly
						released. This seems to have been very distasteful to the accusing girls.
						They were determined not to let it rest so; and put into operation their
						utmost energies to get her back to imprisonment. On the 20th of May, Mercy
						Lewis, being then at the house of John Putnam, Jr., was taken with fits, and
						experienced tortures of unprecedented severity. The particular circumstances
						on this occasion, as gathered from various depositions, illustrate very
						strikingly the skilful manner in which the girls managed to produce the
						desired effect upon the public mind.</p>
					<p>Samuel Abbey, a neighbor, whether sent for or not we are not informed, went
						to John Putnam's house that morning, about nine o'clock. He found Mercy in
							<pb n="201" id="vII201"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2206">
							<figDesc>Page 201.</figDesc>
						</figure> a terrible condition, crying out with piteous tones of anguish,
						“Dear Lord, receive my soul.” — “Lord, let them not kill me quite.” — “Pray
						for the salvation of my soul, for they will kill me outright.” He was
						desired to go to Thomas Putnam's house to bring his daughter Ann, “to see if
						she could see who it was that hurt Mercy Lewis.” He found Abigail Williams
						with Ann, and they accompanied him back to John Putnam. On the way, they
						both cried out that they saw the apparition of Goody Easty afflicting Mercy
						Lewis. When they reached the scene, they exclaimed, “There is Goody Easty
						and John Willard and Mary Whittredge afflicting the body of Mercy Lewis;”
						Mercy at the time laboring for breath, and appearing as choked and
						strangled, convulsed, and apparently at the last gasp. “Thus,” says Abbey,
						“she continued the greatest part of the day, in such tortures as no tongue
						can express.” Mary Walcot was sent for. Upon coming in, she cried out,
						“There is the apparition of Goody Easty choking Mercy Lewis, pressing upon
						her breasts with both her hands, and putting a chain about her neck.” A
						message was then despatched for Elizabeth Hubbard. She, too, saw the shape
						of Goody Easty, “the very same woman that was sent home the other day,”
						aided in her diabolical operations by Willard and Whittredge, “torturing
						Mercy in a most dreadful manner.” Intelligence of the shocking sufferings of
						Mercy was circulated far and wide, and people hurried to the spot from all
						directions. Jonathan Putnam, James Darling, Benjamin <pb n="202" id="vII202"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2207">
							<figDesc>Page 202.</figDesc>
						</figure> Hutchinson, and Samuel Braybrook reached the house during the
						evening, and found Mercy “in a case as if death would have quickly
						followed.” Occasionally, Mercy would have a respite; and, at such intervals,
						Elizabeth Hubbard would fill the gap. “These two fell into fits by turns;
						the one being well while the other was ill.” Each of them continued, all the
						while, crying out against Goody Easty, uttering in their trances vehement
						remonstrances against her cruel operations, representing her as bringing
						their winding-sheets and coffins, and threatening to kill them “if they
						would not sign to her book.” Their acting was so complete that the
						bystanders seem to have thought that they heard the words of Easty, as well
						as the responses of the girls; and that they saw the “winding-sheet,
						coffin,” and “the book.” In the general consternation, Marshal Herrick was
						sent for. What he saw, heard, thought, and did, appears from the following:
						—</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“May 20, 1692. — <hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of George
								Herrick,</hi> aged thirty-four or thereabouts, and <hi

							thirty-five years or thereabouts. — Testifieth and saith, that, being at
							the house of the above-said John Putnam, both saw Mercy Lewis in a very
							dreadful and solemn condition, so that to our apprehension she could not
							continue long in this world without a mitigation of those torments we
							saw her in, which caused us to expedite a hasty despatch to apprehend
							Mary Easty, in hopes, if possible, it might save her life; and,
							returning the same night to said John Putnam's house about midnight, <pb
								n="203" id="vII203"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2208">
								<figDesc>Page 203.</figDesc>
							</figure> we found the said Mercy Lewis in a dreadful fit, but her
							reason was then returned. Again she said, `What! have you brought me the
							winding-sheet, Goodwife Easty? Well, I had rather go into the
							winding-sheet than set my hand to the book;' but, after that, her fits
							were weaker and weaker, but still complaining that she was very sick of
							her stomach. About break of day, she fell asleep, but still continues
							extremely sick, and was taken with a dreadful fit just as we left her;
							so that we perceived life in her, and that was all.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Edward Putnam, after stating that the grievous afflictions and tortures of
						Mercy Lewis were charged, by her and the other four girls, upon Mary Easty,
						deposes as follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“I myself, being there present with several others, looked for nothing
							else but present death for almost the space of two days and a night. She
							was choked almost to death, insomuch we thought sometimes she had been
							dead; her mouth and teeth shut; and all this very often until such time
							as we understood Mary Easty was laid in irons.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Mercy's fits did not cease immediately upon Easty's being apprehended, but on
						her being committed to prison and chains by the magistrate in Salem.</p>
					<p>An examination of distances, with the map before us, will show the rapidity
						with which business was despatched on this occasion. Abbey went to John
						Putnam, Jr.'s house at nine o'clock in the morning of May 20. He was sent to
						Thomas Putnam's house for Ann, and brought her and Abigail Williams back
						with him. Mary Walcot was sent for to the house of her father, Captain
						Jonathan Walcot, and went up at one <pb n="204" id="vII204"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2209">
							<figDesc>Page 204.</figDesc>
						</figure> o'clock, “about an hour by sun.” Then Elizabeth Hubbard, who lived
						at the house of Dr. Griggs, “was carried up to Constable John Putnam's
						house:” Jonathan Putnam, James Darling, Benjamin Hutchinson, and Samuel
						Braybrook got there in the evening, as they say, “between eight and eleven
						o'clock.” In the mean time, Marshal Herrick had arrived. Steps were taken to
						get out a warrant. John Putnam and Benjamin Hutchinson went to Salem to
						Hathorne for the purpose. They must have started soon after eight. Hathorne
						issued the warrant forthwith. It is dated May 20. Herrick went with it to
						the house of Isaac Easty, made the arrest, sent his prisoner to the jail in
						Salem, and returned himself to John Putnam's house “about midnight;” staid
						to witness the apparently mortal sufferings of Mercy until “about break of
						day;” returned to Salem; had the examination before Hathorne, at Thomas
						Beadle's: the whole thing was finished, Mary Easty in irons, information of
						the result carried to John Putnam's, and Mercy's agonies ceased that
						afternoon, as Edward Putnam testifies.</p>
					<p>I have given this particular account of the circumstances that led to and
						attended Mary Easty's second arrest, because the papers belonging to the
						case afford, in some respects, a better insight of the state of things than
						others, and because they enable us to realize the power which the accusing
						girls exercised. The continuance of their convulsions and spasms for such a
						length of time, the large number of persons who witnessed and watched them
						in the broad daylight, and <pb n="205" id="vII205"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2210">
							<figDesc>Page 205.</figDesc>
						</figure> the perfect success of their operations, show how thoroughly they
						had become trained in their arts. I have presented the occurrences in the
						order of time, so that, by estimating the distances traversed and the period
						within which they took place, an idea can be formed of the vehement
						earnestness with which men acted in the “hurrying distractions of amazing
						afflictions” and overwhelming terrors. This instance also gives us a view of
						the horrible state of things, when any one, however respectable and worthy,
						was liable, at any moment, to be seized, maligned, and destroyed.</p>
					<p>Mary Easty had previously experienced the malice of the persecutors. For two
						months she had suffered the miseries of imprisonment, had just been
						released, and for two days enjoyed the restoration of liberty, the comforts
						of her home, and a re-union with her family. She and they, no doubt,
						considered themselves safe from any further outrage. After midnight, she was
						roused from sleep by the unfeeling marshal, torn from her husband and
						children, carried back to prison, loaded with chains, and finally consigned
						to a dreadful and most cruel death. She was an excellent and pious matron.
						Her husband, referring to the transaction nearly twenty years afterwards,
						justly expressed what all must feel, that it was “a hellish
						molestation.”</p>
					<p>One of the most malignant witnesses against Mary Easty was “Goodwife Bibber.”
						She obtruded herself in many of the cases, acting as a sort of outside
						member of the “accusing circle,” volunteering her aid in <pb n="206"
							id="vII206"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2211">
							<figDesc>Page 206.</figDesc>
						</figure> carrying on the persecutions. It was an outrage for the
						magistrates or judges to have countenanced such a false defamer. There are,
						among the papers, documents which show that she ought to have been punished
						as a calumniator, rather than be called to utter, under oath, lies against
						respectable people. The following deposition was sworn to in Court: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Joseph Fowler,</hi> who testifieth
							that Goodman Bibber and his wife lived at my house; and I did observe
							and take notice that Goodwife Bibber was a woman who was very idle in
							her calling, and very much given to tattling and tale-bearing, making
							mischief amongst her neighbors, and very much given to speak bad words,
							and would call her husband bad names, and was a woman of a very
							turbulent, unruly spirit.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Joseph Fowler lived in Wenham, and was a person of respectability and
						influence. His brother Philip was also a leading man; was employed as
						attorney by the Village Parish in its lawsuit with Mr. Parris; and married a
						sister of Joseph Herrick. They were the grandsons of the first Philip, who
						was an early emigrant from Wales, settling in Ipswich, where he had large
						landed estates. Henry Fowler and his two brothers, now of Danvers, are the
						descendants of this family: one of them, Augustus, distinguished as a
						naturalist, especially in the department of ornithology; the other, Samuel
						Page Fowler, as an explorer of our early annals and local antiquities. In
						1692, one of the Fowlers conducted the proceedings in Court <pb n="207"
							id="vII207"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2212">
							<figDesc>Page 207.</figDesc>
						</figure> against the head and front of the witchcraft prosecution; and the
						other had the courage, in the most fearful hour of the delusion, to give
						open testimony in the defence of its victims. It is an interesting
						circumstance, that one of the same name and descent, in his reprint of the
						papers of Calef and in other publications, has done as much as any other
						person of our day to bring that whole transaction under the light of truth
						and justice.</p>

						<p>On the 21st of May, warrants were issued against the wife of William

						<p>The case of Martha Carrier has some remarkable features. It has been

							not only permitted, but induced, to become witnesses against their
							parents, and parents against their children. Husbands and wives were
							made to criminate each other as witnesses in court. When Martha Carrier
							was arrested, four of her children were also taken into custody. An
							indictment against one of them is among the papers. Under the terrors
							brought to bear upon them, they were prevailed on to be confessors. The
							following shows how these children were trained to tell their
							story:—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“It was asked Sarah Carrier by the magistrates, —</p>
							<p>“How long hast thou been a witch? — Ever since I was six years
								old.</p>
							<p>“How old are you now? — Near eight years old: brother Richard says I
								shall be eight years old in November next.</p>
							<p>“Who made you a witch? — My mother: she made me set my hand to a
								book.</p>
							<p>“How did you set your hand to it? — I touched it with my fingers, and
								the book was red: the paper of it was white.</p>
							<p>“She said she never had seen the black man: the place where she did
								it was in Andrew Foster's pasture, and Elizabeth Johnson, Jr., was
								there. Being asked who was there besides, she answered, her aunt
								Toothaker and her cousin. <pb n="210" id="vII210"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2215">
									<figDesc>Page 210.</figDesc>
								</figure> Being asked when it was, she said, when she was
								baptized.</p>
							<p>“What did they promise to give you? — A black dog.</p>
							<p>“Did the dog ever come to you? — No.</p>
							<p>“But you said you saw a cat once: what did that say to you? — It said
								it would tear me in pieces, if I would not set my hand to the
								book.</p>
							<p>“She said her mother baptized her, and the Devil, or black man, was
								not there, as she saw; and her mother said, when she baptized her,
								`Thou art mine for ever and ever. Amen.'</p>
							<p>“How did you afflict folks? — I pinched them.</p>
							<p>“And she said she had no puppets, but she went to them that she
								afflicted. Being asked whether she went in her body or her spirit,
								she said in her spirit. She said her mother carried her thither to
								afflict.</p>
							<p>“How did your mother carry you when she was in prison? — She came
								like a black cat.</p>
							<p>“How did you know it was your mother? — The cat told me so, that she
								was my mother. She said she afflicted Phelps's child last Saturday,
								and Elizabeth Johnson joined with her to do it. She had a wooden
								spear, about as long as her finger, of Elizabeth Johnson; and she
								had it of the Devil. She would not own that she had ever been at the
								witch-meeting at the village. This is the substance.</p>

							<p>“How long has your brother been a witch? — Near a month.</p>
							<p>“How long have you been a witch? — Not long.</p>
							<p>“Have you joined in afflicting the afflicted persons? — Yes.</p>
							<p>“You helped to hurt Timothy Swan, did you? — Yes.</p>
							<p>“How long have you been a witch? — About five weeks.</p>
							<p>“Who was in company when you covenanted with the Devil? — Mrs.
								Bradbury.</p>
							<p>“Did she help you afflict? — Yes.</p>
							<p>“Who was at the village meeting when you were there? — Goodwife How,
								Goodwife Nurse, Goodwife Wildes, Procter and his wife, Mrs.
								Bradbury, and Corey's wife.</p>
							<p>“What did they do there? — Eat, and drank wine.</p>
							<p>“Was there a minister there? — No, not as I know of.</p>
							<p>“From whence had you your wine? — From Salem, I think, it was.</p>
							<p>“Goodwife Oliver there? — Yes: I knew her.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>In concluding his report of the trial of this wretched woman, whose
							children were thus made to become the instruments for procuring her
							death, Dr. Cotton Mathjer expresses himself in the following language:
							—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“This rampant hag (Martha Carrier) was the person of whom the
								confessions of the witches, and of her own children among the rest,
								agreed that the Devil had promised her that she should be queen of
								Hell.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>It is quite evident that this “rampant hag” had no better opinion of the
							dignitaries and divines who managed matters at the time than they had of
							her. <pb n="212" id="vII212"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2217">
								<figDesc>Page 212.</figDesc>
							</figure> The record of her examination shows that she was not afraid to
							speak her mind, and in plain terms too. When brought before the
							magistrates, the following were their questions and her answers. The
							accusing witnesses having severally made their charges against her,
							declaring that she had tormented them in various ways, and threatened to
							cut their throats if they would not sign the Devil's book, which, they
							said, she had presented to them, the magistrates addressed her in these
							words: “What do you say to this you are charged with?” She answered, “I
							have not done it.” One of the accusers cried out that she was, at that
							moment, sticking pins into her. Another declared that she was then
							looking upon “the black man,” — the shape in which they pretended the
							Devil appeared. The magistrate asked the accused, “What black man is
							that?” Her answer was, “I know none.” The accusers cried out that the
							black man was present, and visible to them. The magistrate asked her,
							“What black man did you see?” Her answer was, “I saw no black man but
							your own presence.” Whenever she looked upon the accusers, they were
							knocked down. The magistrate, entirely deluded by their practised
							acting, said to her, “Can you look upon these, and not knock them down?”
							Her answer was, “They will dissemble, if I look upon them.” He
							continued: “You see, you look upon them, and they fall down.” She broke
							out, “It is false: the Devil is a liar. I looked upon none since I came
							into the room but you.” Susanna Sheldon cried out, in a trance, “I
							wonder what could <pb n="213" id="vII213"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2218">
								<figDesc>Page 213.</figDesc>
							</figure> you murder thirteen persons for.” At this, her spirit became
							aroused: the accusers fell into the most intolerable outcries and
							agonies. The accused rebuked the magistrate, charging him with
							unfairness in not paying any regard to what she said, and receiving
							every thing that the accusers said. “It is a shameful thing, that you
							should mind these folks that are out of their wits;” and, turning to
							those who were bringing these false and ridiculous charges against her,
							she said, “You lie: I am wronged.” The energy and courage of the
							prisoner threw the accusers, magistrates, and the whole crowd into
							confusion and uproar. The record closes the description of the scene in
							these words: “The tortures of the afflicted were so great that there was
							no enduring of it, so that she was ordered away, and to be bound hand
							and foot with all expedition; the afflicted, in the mean while, almost
							killed, to the great trouble of all spectators, magistrates, and
							others.”</p>
						<p>Parris closes his report of this examination as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Note.</hi> — As soon as she was well bound,
								they all had strange and sudden ease. Mary Walcot told the
								magistrates that this woman told her she had been a witch this forty
								years.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>This shows the sort of communications the girls were allowed to hold with
							the magistrates, exciting their prejudices against accused persons, and
							filling their ears with all sorts of exaggerated and false stories.
							However much she may have been maligned <pb n="214" id="vII214"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2219">
								<figDesc>Page 214.</figDesc>
							</figure> by her neighbors, some of whom had long been in the habit of
							circulating slanders against her, the whole tenor of the papers relating
							to her shows that she always indignantly repelled the charge of being a
							witch, and was the last person in the world to have volunteered such a
							statement as Mary Walcot reported.</p>
						<p>The examination of Martha Carrier must have been one of the most striking
							scenes of the whole drama of the witchcraft proceedings. The village
							meeting-house presented a truly wild and exciting spectacle. The fearful
							and horrible superstition which darkened the minds of the people was
							displayed in their aspect and movements. Their belief, that, then and
							there, they were witnessing the great struggle between the kingdoms of
							God and of the Evil One, and that every thing was at stake on the issue,
							gave an awe-struck intensity to their expression. The blind,
							unquestioning confidence of the magistrates, clergy, and all concerned
							in the prosecutions, in the evidence of the accusers; the loud outcries
							of their pretended sufferings; their contortions, swoonings, and
							tumblings, excited the usual consternation in the assembly. In addition
							to this, there was the more than ordinary bold and defiant bearing of
							the prisoner, stung to desperation by the outrage upon human nature in
							the abuse practised upon her poor children; her firm and unshrinking
							courage, facing the tempest that was raised to overwhelm her, sternly
							rebuking the magistrates, — “It is a shameful thing that you should mind
							these folks <pb n="215" id="vII215"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2220">
								<figDesc>Page 215.</figDesc>
							</figure> that are out of their wits;” — her whole demeanor, proclaiming
							her conscious innocence, and proving that she chose chains, the dungeon,
							and the scaffold, rather than to belie herself. Seldom has a scene in
							real life, or a picture wrought by the inspiration of genius and the
							hand of art, in its individual characters or its general grouping,
							surpassed that presented on this occasion.</p>
						<p>Hutchinson has preserved the record of another examination of a different
							character. An ignorant negro slave-woman was brought before the
							magistrates. She was cunning enough, not only to confess, but to cover
							herself with the cloak of having been led into the difficulty by her
							mistress.</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Candy, are you a witch? — Candy no witch in her country. Candy's
								mother no witch. Candy no witch, Barbados. This country, mistress
								give Candy witch.</p>
							<p>“Did your mistress make you a witch in this country? — Yes: in this
								country, mistress give Candy witch.</p>
							<p>“What did your mistress do to make you witch? — Mistress bring book
								and pen and ink; make Candy write in it.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Upon being asked what she wrote, she took a pen and ink, and made a mark.
							Upon being asked how she afflicted people, and where were the puppets
							she did it with, she said, that, if they would let her go out for a
							moment, she would show them how. They allowed her to go out, and she
							presently returned with two pieces of cloth or linen, — one with two
							knots, the other with one tied in it. Immediately on seeing these
							articles, the “afflicted children” were “greatly <pb n="216" id="vII216"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2221">
								<figDesc>Page 216.</figDesc>
							</figure> affrighted,” and fell into violent fits. When they came to,
							they declared that the “black man,” Mrs. Hawkes, and the negro, stood by
							the puppets of rags, and pinched them. Whereupon they fell into fits
							again. “A bit of one of the rags being set on fire,” they all shricked
							that they were burned, and “cried out dreadfully.” Some pieces being
							dipped in water, they went into the convulsions and struggles of
							drowning persons; and one of them rushed out of the room, and raced down
							towards the river.</p>
						<p>Candy and the girls having played their parts so well, there was no
							escape for poor Mrs. Hawkes but in confession, which she forthwith made.
							They were both committed to prison. Fortunately, it was not convenient
							to bring them to trial until the next January, when, the delusion having
							blown over, they were acquitted.</p>
						<p>Besides those already mentioned, there were others, among the victims of
							this delusion, whose cases excite our tenderest sensibility, and deepen
							our horror in the contemplation of the scene. It seems, that, some time
							before the transactions took place in Salem Village, a difficulty arose
							between two families on the borders of Topsfield and Ipswich, such as
							often occur among neighbors, about some small matter of property,
							fences, or boundaries. Their names were Perley and How. A daughter of
							Perley, about ten years of age, hearing, probably, strong expressions by
							her parents, became excited against the Hows, and charged the wife of
							How with bewitching her. She acted much <pb n="217" id="vII217"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2222">
								<figDesc>Page 217.</figDesc>
							</figure> after the manner of the “afflicted girls” in Salem Village,
							which was near the place of her residence. Very soon the idea became
							current that Mrs. How was a witch; and every thing that happened amiss
							to any one was laid at her door. She was cried out against by the
							“afflicted children” in Salem Village, and carried before the
							magistrates for examination on the 31st of May, 1692. Upon being brought
							into her presence, the accusers fell into their usual fits and
							convulsions, and charged her with tormenting them. To the question, put
							by the magistrates, “What say you to this charge?” her answer was, “If
							it was the last moment I was to live, God knows I am innocent of any

							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Samuel Phillips,</hi> aged

								daughter, who was visited with strange fits; and, in her fits (as
								her father and mother affirmed), did mention Goodwife How, the wife
								of James How, Jr., of Ipswich, as if she was in the house, and did
								afflict her. When we were in the house, the child had one of her
								fits, but made no mention of Goodwife How; and, when the fit was
								over, and she came to herself, Goodwife How went to the child, and
								took her by the hand, and asked her whether she had ever done her
								any hurt; and she answered, `No, never; and, if I did complain of
								you in my fits, I knew not that I did so.' I further can affirm,
								upon oath, that young Samuel Perley, brother to the afflicted girl,
								looked out of a chamber window (I and the afflicted child being
								without doors together), and said to his sister, `Say Goodwife How
								is a witch, — say she is a witch;' and the child spake not a word
								that way. But I looked up to the window where the youth stood, and
								rebuked him for his boldness to stir up his sister to accuse the
								said Goodwife How; whereas she had cleared her from doing any hurt
								to his sister in both our hearing; and I added, `No wonder that the
								child, in her fits, did mention Goodwife How, when her nearest
								relations were so frequent in expressing their suspicions, in the
								child's hearing, when she was out of her fits, that the said
								Goodwife How was an instrument of mischief to the child.”'</p>

							beautiful <unclear/> tures of a truly forgiving spirit and of <unclear/>
							love anywhere to be found. Several witnesses <unclear/> “We often spoke

							“by the fortnight together;” that they never knew any thing but what was
							good in her. They “found, at all times, by her discourse, she was a
							woman of afflication, and mourning for sin in herself and others; and,
							when she met with any affliction, she seemed to justify God and say that
							it was all better than she deserved, though it was by false accusations
							from men. She used to bless God that she got good by affliction; for it
							made her examine her own heart. We never heard her revile any person
							that hath accused her with witchcraft, but pitied them, and said, `I

						<p>The father of her husband, — James How, Sr., aged about ninety-four

						<p>“he, living by her for about thirty years, hath taken notice that she

							all relations, setting aside human infirmities, as becometh a Christian;

							son, very careful, loving, obedient, and kind, — considering his want of
							eyesight, tenderly leading him about by the hand. Desiring God may guide
							your honors,... I rest yours to serve.”</p>
						<p>The only evidence against this good woman — be yond the outcries and fits
							of the “afflicted children,” enacted in their usual skilful and artful
							style — consisted of the most wretched gossip ever circulated in an
							ignorant and benighted community. It came from people in the back
							settlements of Ipswich and Topsfield, and disclosed a depth of absurd
							and brutal superstition, which it is difficult to believe ever existed
							in New England. So far as those living in secluded and remote localities
							are regarded, this was the most benighted period of our history. Except
							where, as in Salem Village, special circumstances had kept up the
							general intelligence, there was much darkness on the popular mind. The
							education that came over with the first emigrants from the
							mother-country had gone with them to their graves. The system of common
							schools had not begun to produce its fruit in the thinly peopled outer
							settlements. There is no more disgraceful page in our annals than that
							which <pb n="222" id="vII222"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2227">
								<figDesc>Page 222.</figDesc>
							</figure> details the testimony given at the trial, and records the
							conviction and execution, of Elizabeth How.</p>
						<p>But the dark shadows of that day of folly, cruelty, and crime, served to
							bring into a brighter and purer light virtues exhibited by many persons.
							We meet affecting instances, all along, of family fidelity and true
							Christian benevolence. James How, as has been stated, was stricken with
							blindness. He had two daughters, Mary and Abigail. Although their farm
							was out of the line of the public-roads, travel very difficult, and they
							must have encountered many hardships, annoyances, and, it is to be
							feared, sometimes unfeeling treatment by the way, one of them
							accompanied their father, twice every week, to visit their mother in her
							prison-walls. They came on horseback; she managing the bridle, and
							guiding him by the hand after alighting. Their humble means were
							exhausted in these offices of reverence and affection. One of the noble
							girls made her way to Boston, sought out the Governor, and implored a
							reprieve for her mother; but in vain. The sight of these young women,
							leading their blind father to comfort and provide for their “honored
							mother, — as innocent,” as they declared her to be, “of the crime
							charged, as any person in the world,” — so faithful and constant in
							their filial love and duty, relieved the horrors of the scene; and it
							ought to be held in perpetual remembrance. The shame of that day is not,
							and will not be, forgotten; neither should its beauty and glory.</p>
						<p>The name of Elizabeth How, before marriage, was <pb n="223" id="vII223"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2228">

							</figure> Jackson. Among the accounts rendered against the country for
							expenses incurred in the witchcraft prosecutions are these two items:
							“For John Jackson, Sr., one pair of fetters, five shillings; for John
							Jackson, Jr., one pair of fetters, five shillings.” There is also an
							item for carrying “the two Jacksons” from one jail to another, and back
							again. No other reference to them is found among the papers. They were,
							perhaps, a brother and nephew of Elizabeth How. There is reason to
							suppose that her husband, James How, Jr., was a nephew of the Rev.
							Francis Dane, of Andover.</p>
						<p>The examination of Job Tookey, of Beverly, presents some points worthy of
							notice. He is described as a “laborer,” but was evidently a person,
							although perhaps inconsiderate of speech, of more than common
							discrimination, and not wholly deluded by the fanaticism of the times.
							He is charged with having said that he “would take Mr. Burroughs's
							part;” “that he was not the Devil's servant, but the Devil was his.”
							When the girls testified that they saw his shape afflicting persons, he
							answered, like a sensible man, if they really saw any such thing, “it
							was not he, but the Devil in his shape, that hurts the people.” Susanna
							Sheldon, Mary Warren, and Ann Putnam, all declared, that, at that very
							moment while the examination was going on, two men and two women and one
							child “rose from the dead, and cried, `Vengeance! vengeance!”' Nobody
							else saw or heard any thing: but the girls suddenly became dumb; their
							eyes were <pb n="224" id="vII224"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2229">
								<figDesc>Page 224.</figDesc>
							</figure> fixed on vacancy, all looking towards the same spot; and their
							whole appearance gave assurance of the truth of what they said. In a
							short time, Mary Warren recovered the use of her vocal organs, and
							exclaimed, “There are three men, and three women, and two children. They
							are all in their winding-sheets: they look pale upon us, but red upon
							Tookey, — red as blood.” Again, she exclaimed, in a startled and
							affrighted manner, “There is a young child under the table, crying out
							for vengeance.” Elizabeth Booth, pointing to the same place, was struck
							speechless. In this way, the murder of about every one who had died at
							Royal Side, for a year or two past, was put upon Tookey. Some of them
							were called by name; the others, the girls pretended not to recognize.
							The wrath and horror of the whole community were excited against him,
							and he was committed to jail, by the order of the magistrates, —
							Bartholomew Gedney, Jonathan Corwin, and John Hathorne.</p>
						<p>No character, indeed, however blameless lovely or venerable, was safe.
							The malignant accusers struck at the highest marks, and the consuming
							fire of popular frenzy was kindled and attracted towards the most
							commanding objects. Mary Bradbury is described, in the indictment
							against her, as the “wife of Captain Thomas Bradbury, of Salisbury, in
							the county of Essex, gentleman.” A few of the documents that are
							preserved, belonging to her case, will give some idea what sort of a

								of the word, and all the ordinances of the gospel; full of works of
								charity and mercy to the sick and poor: neither have I seen or heard
								any thing of her unbecoming the profession of the gospel.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Robert Pike also affirmed to the truth of Mr. Allin's statement, from
							“upwards of fifty years' experience,” as did John Pike also: they both
							declared themselves ready and desirous to give their testimony before
							the Court.</p>
						<p>One hundred and seventeen of her neighbors — the larger part of them
							heads of families, and embracing the most respectable people of that
							vicinity — signed their names to a paper, of which the following is a
							copy: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Concerning Mrs. Bradbury's life and conversation, we, the
								subscribers, do testify, that it was such as became the gospel: she
								was a lover of the ministry, in all appearance, and a diligent
								attender upon God's holy ordinances, being of a courteous and
								peaceable disposition and carriage. Neither did any of us (some of

								woman, or child, — but was always ready and willing to do for them
								what lay in her power night and day, though with hazard of her
								health, or other danger. More might be spoken in her commendation,
								but this for the present.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Although this aged matron and excellent Christian lady was convicted and
							sentenced to death, it is most satisfactory to find that she escaped
							from prison, and her life was saved.</p>
						<p>The following facts show the weight which ought to have been attached to
							these statements. The position, as well as character and age, of Mary
							[Perkins] Bradbury entitled her to the highest consideration, in the
							structure of society at that time. This is recognized in the title
							“Mrs.,” uniformly given her. She had been noted, through life, for
							business capacity, energy, and influence; and, in 1692, was probably
							seventy-five years of age, and somewhat infirm in health. Her husband,
							Thomas Bradbury, had been a prominent character in the colony for more
							than fifty years. In 1641, he was appointed, by the General Court, Clerk
							of the Writs for Salisbury, with the functions of a magistrate, to
							execute all sorts of legal processes in that place. He was a deputy in
							1651 and many subsequent years; a commissioner for Salisbury in 1657,
							empowered to act in all criminal cases, and bind over offenders, where
							it was proper, to higher courts, to take testimonies upon oath, and to
							join persons in marriage. He was required to keep a record of all his
								<pb n="228" id="vII228"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2233">
								<figDesc>Page 228.</figDesc>
							</figure> doings. If the parties agreed to that effect, he was
							authorized to hear and determine cases of every kind and degree, without
							the intervention of a jury. The towns north of the Merrimac, and all
							beyond now within the limits of New Hampshire, constituted the County of
							Norfolk; and Thomas Bradbury, for a long series of years, was one of its
							commissioners and associate judges. From the first, he was conspicuous
							in military matters; having been commissioned by the General Court, in
							1648, Ensign of the trainband in Salisbury. He rose to its command; and,
							in the latter portion of his life, was universally spoken of as “Captain
							Bradbury.” All along, the records of the General Court, for half a
							century, demonstrate the estimation in which he was held; various
							important trusts and special services requiring integrity and ability
							being from time to time committed to him. His family was influentially
							connected. His son William married the widow of Samuel Maverick, Jr.,
							who was the son of one of the King's Commissioners in 1664. she was the
							daughter of the Rev. John Wheelwright, a man of great note, intimately
							related to the celebrated Anne Hutchinson, and united with her by
							sympathy in sentiment and participation in exile.</p>
						<p>Robert Pike, born in 1616, was a magistrate in 1644. He was deputy from
							Salisbury in 1648, and many times after; Associate Justice for Norfolk
							in 1650; and Assistant in 1682, holding that high station, by annual
							elections, to the close of the first charter, and during the whole
							period of the intervening and insurgent <pb n="229" id="vII229"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2234">
								<figDesc>Page 229.</figDesc>
							</figure> government. He was named as one of the council that succeeded
							to the House of Assistants, when, under the new charter, Massachusetts
							became a royal province. He was always at the head of military affairs,
							having been commissioned, by the General Court, Lieutenant of the
							Salisbury trainband in 1648; and, in the later years of his life, he
							held the rank and title of major. John Pike, probably his son, resided
							in Hampton in 1691, and was minister of Dover at his death in 1710.</p>
						<p>Surely, the attestations of such men as the Pikes, father and son, and
							the Rev. James Allin, to the Christian excellence of Mary Bradbury, must
							be allowed to corroborate fully the declarations of her neighbors, her
							husband, and herself.</p>
						<p>The motives and influences that led to her arrest and condemnation in
							1692 demand an explanation. The question arises, Why should the
							attention of the accusing girls have been led to this aged and most
							respectable woman, living at such a distance, beyond the Merrimac? A
							critical scrutiny of the papers in the case affords a clew leading to
							the true answer.</p>
						<p>The wife of Sergeant Thomas Putnam, as has been stated (vol. i. p. 253),
							was Ann Carr of Salisbury. Her father, George Carr, was an early settler
							in that place, and appears to have been an enterprising and prosperous
							person. The ferry for the main travel of the country across the Merrimac
							was from points of land owned by him, and always under his charge. He
							was engaged in ship-building, — employing, and <pb n="230" id="vII230"/>

								Mr. George Carr's horse's legs, which made him stumble after a
								strange manner. And I also saw the blue boar dart from Mr. Carr's
								horse's legs in at Mrs. Bradbury window. And Mr. Carr immediately
								said, `Boys, what did you see?' And we both said, `A blue boar.'
								Then said he, `From whence came it?' And we said, `Out of Mr.
								Bradbury's gate.' Then said he, `I am glad you see it as well as I.'

							deposition the following: —</p>

						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“And they both further say, on their oaths, that Mr. Carr discoursed
								with them, as they went home, about what had happened, and they all
								concluded that it was Mrs. Bradbury that so appeared as a blue
								boar.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>At the date of this occurrence, Richard Carr was twenty years of age, and
							Zerubabel Endicott a lad of of fifteen.</p>
						<p>It is not to be wondered at that there was “some difference between”
							George Carr and Mrs. Bradbury, if he was in the habit of indulging in
							such talk about her as he took the leading part in on this occasion. He
							evidently encouraged in his “boys” the absurd imaginations with which
							their credulity had been stimulated. They were prepared by preconceived
							notions to witness something preternatural about the premises of Mrs.
							Bradbury; and, in their jaundiced vision, any animal, moving in and out
							of the gate, might naturally assume the likeness of a “blue boar.” Such
							ideas circulating in the family, and among the apprentices of Carr,
							would soon be widely spread. No doubt, Zerubabel, on his visits to his
							home, told wondrous stories about Mrs. Bradbury. His brother Samuel,
							then a youth of eighteen, had his imagination filled with them; and some
							time after, on a voyage to “Barbadoes and Saltitudos,” in which severe
							storms and various disasters were experienced, attributed them all to
							Mrs. Bradbury; and, “in a bright moonshining night, sitting upon the
							windlass, to which he had been sent forward to look out for land,” the
							wild fancies of his excited imagination took effect. He heard “a <pb
								n="232" id="vII232"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2237">
								<figDesc>Page 232.</figDesc>
							</figure> rumbling noise,” and thought he saw the legs of some person.
							“Presently he was shook, and looked over his shoulder, and saw the
							appearance of a woman, from her middle upwards, having a white cap and
							white neckcloth on her, which then affrighted him very much; and, as he
							was turning of the windlass, he saw the aforesaid two legs.” Such
							superstitious phantasms seem to be natural to the experiences of
							sailor-life, and perhaps still linger in the forecastle and at the
							night-watch.</p>
						<p>The habit of maligning Mrs. Bradbury as a witch dated back in the Carr
							family more than thirteen years, as the following deposition proves. I
							give it precisely as it is in the original. As in a few other instances
							in this work, the spelling and punctuation are preserved as curiosities.

						<p>But the whole of George Carr's family did not sympathize in this morbid

								by degrees much crazed, not being the man, that he was before, to
								his dying day.</p>
							<p>“I do further testify that my said brother was sick about a fortnight

						</q>
						<p>The usual form, <hi rend="italics">jurat in curia,</hi> is written at the

							leads me to mention the improbability that any testimony in favor of the
							accused ever reached the Court at the trials. They had no counsel: the

							circumstances seem to indicate, was Mrs. Ann Putnam. She perhaps had
							experienced the effects of a too early marriage, bringing the burden of
							life upon the constitution and the character before they are mature
							enough to bear it. She may have attributed to this cause the troubles
							and trials with which her cup had been so bitterly filled, and the
							blasting of the happiness of her youth. Half deranged, as perpetual
							excitement from the parish quarrels in reference to Mr. Bayley had made
							her, she may have become morbidly opposed to the equally early marriage
							of a brother. Added to this was the fact that Henry True had married one
							of Mrs. Bradbury daughters, and that Jane True was his sister. It cannot
							be doubted that she entertained the same ideas about Mrs. Bradbury as
							her father and brothers, James and Richard; and, for this reason, also
							opposed the match of her brother John. Wishing to be relieved from the
							self-reproach of having caused his derangement and death, when the
							witchcraft delusion broke out at Salem Village and she became wholly
							absorbed by it, as all other deaths and misfortunes were ascribed to it,
							she avowed and maintained the belief, as some had suspected at the time,
							that the happiness, health, reason, and life of her brother had been
							destroyed by diabolical agency, practised by Mrs. Bradbury.</p>
						<p>In the state of things long subsisting between the Bradbury and Carr
							families, we find an explanation of the movement made against Mrs.
							Bradbury. Young <pb n="237" id="vII237"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2242">
								<figDesc>Page 237.</figDesc>
							</figure> Ann Putnam may have often heard her unpleasantly spoken of by
							her mother, and it was natural that she should have “cried out against
							her.”</p>
						<p>The family of Mrs. Ann Putnam seem to have had constitutional traits that
							illustrate and explain her own character and conduct. They were
							excitable and sensitive to an extraordinary degree. Their judgment,
							reason, and physical systems, were subject to the power of their fancies
							and affections. One of her brothers, in consequence of being badly
							coquetted with and jilted by a young widow, was thrown into an awful
							condition of body and mind “for about three-quarters of a year.” The
							reason, health, and heart of another were broken; and he sunk into an
							early grave, in consequence of having been crossed in love. The death of
							her sister Bayley may have been caused by the unhappy controversies in
							the village parish. We have seen, and shall see, the all but maniac
							condition to which excitement brought her own mind. At last, the
							heaviest blow that can fall upon a fond wife suddenly snapped the
							brittle cord of her life. These considerations must be borne in mind,
							while we attempt to explain her conduct, and should throw the weight of
							pity and charity into the scales, if mortal judgment ventures to
							estimate her guilt. They are known to the Infinite Mind, and never
							overlooked by divine mercy.</p>
						<p>I have introduced these singular private details to illustrate what the
							documents all along show, — that the proceedings against persons charged
							with witchcraft, <pb n="238" id="vII238"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2243">
								<figDesc>Page 238.</figDesc>
							</figure> in 1692, were instigated by all sorts of personal grudges and
							private piques, many of them of long standing, fomented and kept alive
							by an unhappy indulgence of unworthy feelings, always ready to mix
							themselves with popular excitements, and leading all concerned headlong
							to the utmost extent of mischief and wrong.</p>
						<p>The case of Mary Bradbury has been allowed to occupy so large a space,
							because I desire to disabuse the public mind of a great error on this
							subject. It has been too much supposed, that the sufferers in the
							witchcraft delusion were generally of the inferior classes of society,
							and particularly ignorant and benighted. They were the very reverse.
							They mostly belonged to families in the better conditions of life, and,
							many of them, to the highest social level. They were all persons of
							great moral firmness and rectitude, as was demonstrated by their bearing
							under persecutions and outrage, and when confronting the terrors of
							death. Their names do not deserve reproach, and their memories ought to
							be held in honor.</p>
						<p>The following account of the examination of Elizabeth Cary of
							Charlestown, given by her husband, Captain Cary, a shipmaster, has the
							highest interest, as written at the time by one who was an eye-witness,
							and participated in the sufferings of the occasion: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“May 24. — I having heard, some days, that my wife was accused of
								witchcraft; being much disturbed at it, by advice went to Salem
								Village, to see if the afflicted knew her: we arrived there on the
								24th of May. It happened <pb n="239" id="vII239"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2244">
									<figDesc>Page 239.</figDesc>
								</figure> to be a day appointed for examination; accordingly, soon
								after our arrival, Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Corwin, &amp;c., went to the
								meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that work. The
								minister began with prayer; and, having taken care to get a
								convenient place, I observed that the afflicted were two girls of
								about ten years old, and about two or three others of about
								eighteen: one of the girls talked most, and could discern more than
								the rest.</p>
							<p>“The prisoners were called in one by one, and, as they came in, were
								cried out at, &amp;c. The prisoners were placed about seven or eight
								feet from the justices, and the accusers between the justices and
								them. The prisoners were ordered to stand right before the justices,
								with an officer appointed to hold each hand, lest they should
								therewith afflict them: and the prisoners' eyes must be constantly
								on the justices; for, if they looked on the afflicted, they would
								either fall into fits, or cry out of being hurt by them. After an
								examination of the prisoners, who it was afflicted these girls,
								&amp;c., they were put upon saying the Lord's Prayer, as a trial of
								their guilt. After the afflicted seemed to be out of their fits,
								they would look steadfastly on some one person, and frequently not
								speak; and then the justices said they were struck dumb, and after a
								little time would speak again: then the justices said to the
								accusers, `Which of you will go and touch the prisoner at the bar?'
								Then the most courageous would adventure, but, before they had made
								three steps, would ordinarily fall down as in a fit: the justices
								ordered that they should be taken up and carried to the prisoner,
								that she might touch them; and as soon as they were touched by the
								accused, the justices would say, `They are well,' before I could
								discern any alteration, — by which I observed that the justices
								understood the manner of it. <pb n="240" id="vII240"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2245">
									<figDesc>Page 240.</figDesc>
								</figure> Thus far I was only as a spectator: my wife also was there
								part of the time, but no notice was taken of her by the afflicted,
								except once or twice they came to her, and asked her name. But I,
								having an opportunity to discourse Mr. Hale (with whom I had
								formerly acquaintance), I took his advice what I had best do, and
								desired of him that I might have an opportunity to speak with her
								that accused my wife; which he promised should be, I acquainting him
								that I reposed my trust in him. Accordingly, he came to me after the
								examination was over, and told me I had now an opportunity to speak
								with the said accuser, Abigail Williams, a girl eleven or twelve
								years old; but that we could not be in private at Mr. Parris's
								house, as he had promised me: we went therefore into the alehouse,
								where an Indian man attended us, who, it seems, was one of the
								afflicted; to him we gave some cider: he showed several scars, that
								seemed as if they had been long there, and showed them as done by
								witchcraft, and acquainted us that his wife, who also was a slave,
								was imprisoned for witchcraft. And now, instead of one accuser, they
								all came in, and began to tumble down like swine; and then three
								women were called in to attend them. We in the room were all at a
								stand to see who they would cry out of; but in a short time they
								cried out `Cary;' and, immediately after, a warrant was sent from
								the justices to bring my wife before them, who were sitting in a
								chamber near by, waiting for this. Being brought before the
								justices, her chief accusers were two girls. My wife declared to the
								justices, that she never had any knowledge of them before that day.
								She was forced to stand with her arms stretched out. I requested
								that I might hold one of her hands, but it was denied me: then she
								desired me to wipe the tears from her eyes, and the sweat from her
									<pb n="241" id="vII241"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2246">
									<figDesc>Page 241.</figDesc>
								</figure> face, which I did; then she desired she might lean herself
								on me, saying she should faint. Justice Hathorne replied she had
								strength enough to torment these persons, and she should have
								strength enough to stand. I speaking something against their cruel
								proceedings, they commanded me to be silent, or else I should be
								turned out of the room. The Indian before mentioned was also brought
								in, to be one of her accusers; being come in, he now (when before
								the justices) fell down, and tumbled about like a hog, but said
								nothing. The justices asked the girls who afflicted the Indian: they
								answered she (meaning my wife), and that she now lay upon him. The
								justices ordered her to touch him, in order to his cure, but her
								head must be turned another way, lest, instead of curing, she should
								make him worse by her looking on him, her hand being guided to take
								hold of his; but the Indian took hold of her hand, and pulled her
								down on the floor in a barbarous manner: then his hand was taken
								off, and her hand put on his, and the cure was quickly wrought. I
								being extremely troubled at their inhuman dealings, uttered a hasty
								speech, `That God would take vengeance on them, and desired that God
								would deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.' Then her <hi
									rend="italics">mittimus</hi> was writ. I did with difficulty and
								charge obtain the liberty of a room, but no beds in it; if there had
								been, could have taken but little rest that night. She was committed
								to Boston prison; but I obtained a <foreign lang="unknown"
									rend="italics">habeas corpus</foreign> to remove her to
								Cambridge prison, which is in our county of Middlesex. Having been
								there one night, next morning the jailer put irons on her legs
								(having received such a command); the weight of them was about eight
								pounds: these irons and her other afflictions soon brought her into
								convulsion <pb n="242" id="vII242"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2247">
									<figDesc>Page 242.</figDesc>
								</figure> fits, so that I thought she would have died that night. I
								sent to entreat that the irons might be taken off; but all
								entreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her life, so that in
								this condition she must continue. The trials at Salem coming on, I
								went thither to see how things were managed: and finding that the
								spectre evidence was there received, together with idle, if not
								malicious stories, against people's lives, I did easily perceive
								which way the rest would go; for the same evidence that served for
								one would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her danger;
								and that, if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she
								would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her trial in
								our own county; I with several others petitioning the judge for it,
								and were put in hopes of it: but I soon saw so much, that I
								understood thereby it was not intended; which put me upon consulting
								the means of her escape, which, through the goodness of God, was
								effected, and she got to Rhode Island, but soon found herself not
								safe when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she
								went to New York, along with some others that had escaped their
								cruel hands, where we found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Esq.,
								Governor, who was very courteous to us. After this, some of my goods
								were seized in a friend's hands, with whom I had left them, and
								myself imprisoned by the sheriff, and kept in custody half a day,
								and then dismissed; but to speak of their usage of the prisoners,
								and the inhumanity shown to them at the time of their execution, no
								sober Christian could bear. They had also trials of cruel mockings,
								which is the more, considering what a people for religion, I mean
								the profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many
								of <pb n="243" id="vII243"/>

						<p>The only account we have, written by one who had actually experienced, in
							his own person, what it was to fall into the hands of those who got up
							and carried on the prosecutions, is the following. Captain Alden had
							probably been from an early stage in their operations in the eye of the
							accusing girls. He was meant, perhaps, by what often fell from them
							about “the tall man in Boston.” We are left entirely to conjecture as to
							the reason why they singled him out, as not one of them, we may be quite
							sure, had ever seen him. It may be that some person who had experienced
							discipline under his orders as a naval commander bore him a grudge, and
							took pains to suggest his name to the girls, and provided them with the
							coarse, vulgar, and ridiculous scandal they so recklessly poured out
							upon him: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p rend="center">“<hi rend="italics">An Account how John Alden, Sr., was
									dealt with at Salem Village.</hi></p>
							<p>“John Alden, Sr., of Boston, in the county of Suffolk, mariner, on
								the twenty-eighth day of May, 1692, was sent for by the magistrates
								of Salem, in the county of Essex, upon the accusation of a company
								of poor distracted or possessed creatures or witches; and, being
								sent by Mr. Stoughton, arrived there on the 31st of May, and
								appeared at Salem Village before Mr. Gedney, Mr. Hathorne, and Mr.
								Corwin.</p>
							<p>“Those wenches being present who played their juggling <pb n="244"
									id="vII244"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2249">
									<figDesc>Page 244.</figDesc>
								</figure> tricks, falling down, crying out, and staring in people's
								faces, the magistrates demanded of them several times, who it was,
								of all the people in the room, that hurt them. One of these accusers
								pointed several times at one Captain Hill, there present, but spake
								nothing. The same accuser had a man standing at her back to hold her
								up. He stooped down to her ear: then she cried out, `Alden, Alden
								afflicted her.' One of the magistrates asked her if she had ever
								seen Alden. She answered, `No.' He asked her how she knew it was
								Alden. She said the man told her so.</p>
							<p>“Then all were ordered to go down into the street, where a ring was
								made; and the same accuser cried out, `There stands Alden, a bold
								fellow, with his hat on before the judges: he sells powder and shot
								to the Indians and French, and lies with the Indian squaws, and has
								Indian papooses.' Then was Alden committed to the marshal's custody,
								and his sword taken from him; for they said he afflicted them with
								his sword. After some hours, Alden was sent for to the meeting-house
								in the Village, before the magistrates, who required Alden to stand
								upon a chair, to the open view of all the people.</p>
							<p>“The accusers cried out that Alden pinched them then, when he stood
								upon the chair, in the sight of all the people, a good way distant
								from them. One of the magistrates bid the marshal to hold open
								Alden's hands, that he might not pinch those creatures. Alden asked
								them why they should think that he should come to that village to
								afflict those persons that he never knew or saw before. Mr. Gedney
								bid Alden to confess, and give glory to God. Alden said he hoped he
								should give glory to God, and hoped he should never gratify the
								Devil: but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they ever
								suspected him to be such a person; <pb n="245" id="vII245"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2250">
									<figDesc>Page 245.</figDesc>
								</figure> and challenged any one that could bring in any thing on
								their own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being such an
								one. Mr. Gedney said he had known Alden many years, and had been at
								sea with him, and always looked upon him to be an honest man; but
								now he saw cause to alter his judgment. Alden answered, he was sorry
								for that, but he hoped God would clear up his innocency, that he
								would recall that judgment again; and added, that he hoped that he
								should, with Job, maintain his integrity till he died. They bid
								Alden look upon the accusers, which he did, and then they fell down.
								Alden asked Mr. Gedney what reason there could be given why Alden's
								looking upon <hi rend="italics">him</hi> did not strike <hi
									rend="italics">him</hi> down as well; but no reason was given
								that I heard. But the accusers were brought to Alden to touch them;
								and this touch, they said, made them well. Alden began to speak of
								the providence of God in suffering these creatures to accuse
								innocent persons. Mr. Noyes asked Alden why he should offer to speak
								of the providence of God: God, by his providence (said Mr. Noyes),
								governs the world, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with
								discourse, and stopped Alden's mouth as to that. Alden told Mr.
								Gedney that he could assure him that there was a lying spirit in
								them; for I can assure you that there is not a word of truth in all
								these say of me. But Alden was again committed to the marshal, and
								his <hi rend="italics">mittimus</hi> written.</p>
							<p>“To Boston Alden was carried by a constable: no bail would be taken
								for him, but was delivered to the prisonkeeper, where he remained
								fifteen weeks; and then, observing the manner of trials, and
								evidence then taken, was at length prevailed with to make his

						<p>Alden made his escape about the middle of September, at the bloodiest
							crisis of the tragedy, and just before the execution of nine of the
							victims, including that of Giles Corey. He is understood to have fled to
							Duxbury, where his relatives secreted him. He made his appearance among
							them late at night; and, on their asking an explanation of his
							unexpected visit at that hour, replied that he was flying from the
							Devil, and the Devil was after him. After a while, when the delusion had
							abated, and people were coming to their senses, he delivered himself up,
							and was bound over to the Superior Court at Boston, the last Tuesday in
							April, 1693, when, no one appearing to prosecute, he, with some hundred
							and fifty others, was discharged by proclamation, and all judicial
							proceedings brought to a close. It is to be feared, that ever after, to
							his dying day, when the subject of his experience on the 31st of May,
							1692, was referred to, the old sailor indulged in rather strong
							expressions in relating his reminiscences of Rev. “Mr. Nicholas Noyes,”
							“Mr. Bartholomew Gedney,” and the “wenches” of Salem Village.</p>
						<p>Captain John Alden was a son of John Alden, ever memorable as one of the
							first founders of Plymouth Colony. He had been for more than thirty
							years a resident of Boston, a member of the church, and in all respects
							a leading and distinguished man. For some time, he had been commander of
							the armed vessel belonging to the colony, and was a brave and efficient
							officer and an able and experienced mariner. <pb n="247" id="vII247"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2252">
								<figDesc>Page 247.</figDesc>
							</figure> He had seen service in French and Indian wars, had acted two
							years before, that is in 1690, as commissioner in conducting
							negotiations with the native tribes, and, at a later period, was charged
							with important trusts as a naval commander. He was a man of large
							property, and seventy years of age. He was, as well he might be, utterly
							confounded and amazed in finding himself charged as a principal culprit
							in the Salem witchcraft. The accusing girls were evidently delighted to
							get hold of such a notable and doughty character; and their tongues were
							released, on the occasion, from all restraints of decorum and decency.
							When the ring was formed around him “in the street,” in front of Deacon
							Ingersoll's door, his sword unbuckled from his side, and such foul and
							vulgar aspersions cast upon his good name, he felt, no doubt, that it
							would have been better to have fallen into the hands of savages of the
							wilderness or pirates on the sea, than of the crowd of audacious girls
							that hustled him about in Salem Village. It was a relief to his wounded
							honor, and gave leisure for the workings of his indignant resentment, to
							escape from them into Boston jail. Not only his old shipmate,
							Bartholomew Gedney, but, as will be seen, the learned attorney-general,
							who was present, and witnessed the whole affair, was fully convinced of
							his guilt.</p>
						<p>The wife of an honest and worthy man in Andover was sick of a fever.
							After all the usual means had failed to check the symptoms of her
							disease, the idea <pb n="248" id="vII248"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2253">
								<figDesc>Page 248.</figDesc>
							</figure> became prevalent that she was suffering under an “evil hand.”
							The husband, pursuant of the advice of friends, posted down to Salem
							Village to ascertain from the afflicted girls who was bewitching his
							wife. Two of them returned with him to Andover. Never did a place
							receive such fatal visitors. The Grecian horse did not bring greater
							consternation to ancient Ilium. Immediately after their arrival, they
							succeeded in getting more than fifty of the inhabitants into prison,
							several of whom were hanged. A perfect panic swept like a hurricane over
							the place. The idea seized all minds, as Hutchinson expresses it, that
							the only “way to prevent an accusation was to become an accuser.” — “The
							number of the afflicted increased every day, and the number of the
							accused in proportion.” In this state of things, such a great accession
							being made to the ranks of the confessing witches, the power of the
							delusion became irresistibly strengthened. Mr. Dudley Bradstreet, the
							magistrate of the place, after having committed about forty persons to
							jail, concluded he had done enough, and declined to arrest any more. The
							consequence was that he and his wife were cried out upon, and they had
							to fly for their lives. They accused his brother, John Bradstreet, with
							having “afflicted” a dog. Bradstreet escaped by flight. The dog was
							executed. The number of persons who had publicly confessed that they had
							entered into a league with Satan, and exercised the diabolical power
							thus acquired, to the injury, torment, and death of innocent parties,
							produced <pb n="249" id="vII249"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2254">
								<figDesc>Page 249.</figDesc>
							</figure> a profound effect upon the public mind. At the same time, the
							accusers had everywhere increased in number, owing to the inflamed state
							of imagination universally prevalent which ascribed all ailments or
							diseases to the agency of witches, to a mere love of notoriety and a
							passion for general sympathy, to a desire to be secure against the
							charge of bewitching others, or to a malicious disposition to wreak
							vengeance upon enemies. The prisons in Salem, Ipswich, Boston, and
							Cambridge, were crowded. All the securities of society were dissolved.
							Every man's life was at the mercy of every other man. Fear sat on every
							countenance, terror and distress were in all hearts, silence pervaded
							the streets: all who could, quit the country; business was at a stand; a
							conviction sunk into the minds of men, that a dark and infernal
							confederacy had got foot-hold in the land, threatening to overthrow and
							extirpate religion and morality, and establish the kingdom of the Prince
							of darkness in a country which had been dedicated, by the prayers and
							tears and sufferings of its pious fathers, to the Church of Christ and
							the service and worship of the true God. The feeling, dismal and
							horrible indeed, became general, that the providence of God was removed
							from them; that Satan was let loose, and he and his confederates had
							free and unrestrained power to go to and fro, torturing and destroying
							whomever he willed. We cannot, by any extent of research or power of
							imagination, enter fully into the ideas of the people of that day; and

								together. Spelling, at that time, was phonetic, and it enables us to
								ascertain the then prevalent pronunciation of words. “Corsely,” no
								doubt, shows how the word was then spoken. “Angury” was, with a
								large class of words now dissyllables, then a trisyllable. “Tould,”
								“spaking,” and many other words above, are spelled just as they were
								then pronounced. “Wicthcraft” is always, I believe, spelled this way
								by Thomas Putnam. He had not got rid of the old Anglo-Saxon sound of
								the word “witch,” brought by his father from Buckinghamshire, sixty
								years before, — “wicca.”</p>
							<p>The condition of medical science and practice, at that period, is
								curiously illustrated in this paper. It is plain that the distemper
								of James Carr was purely in the realm of the sensibilities and
								fancy; and “doctor Crosbe” is not wholly to blame because his
								“visek” did not “work.” A good smart nightmare, with a feeling that
								he had given a thorough basting to the spectre, in the form of a
								cat, of the supposed author of his woful and aggravated
								disappointment in love, was what he needed; and it cured him. “A
								posset of sack” was Falstaff's refuge, from the plight into which he
								had been led by “building upon a foolish woman's promise,” when he
								emerged from the Thames and the “buck-basket.” Many others, no
								doubt, in drowning sorrow and mortification, have found it “the
								sovereignest thing on earth.” But, as administered by physicians of
								the Dr. Crosby school, with tobacco steeped in it, it must have been
								a “villanous compound.”</p>

						<p>In the midst of this state of things, the old colony of Massachusetts was
							transformed into a royal province, and a new government organized. Sir
							William Phips, the governor, arrived at Boston, with the new charter, on
							the evening of the 14th of May. William Stoughton, of Dorchester,
							superseded Thomas Danforth as deputy-governor. In the Council, which
							took the place of the Assistants, most of the former body were retained.
							Bartholomew Gedney had a few years before been dropped from the board of
							Assistants. He was now placed in the Council with John Hathorne,
							Jonathan Corwin, Samuel Appleton, and Robert Pike, of this county. The
							new government did not interfere with the proceedings in progress
							relating to the witchcraft prosecutions, at the moment. Examinations and
							commitments went on as before; only the magistrates, acting on those
							occasions, were re-enforced by Mr. Gedney, who presided at their
							sessions. The affair had become so formidable, and the public
							infatuation had reached such a point, that it was difficult to determine
							what ought to be done. Sir William Phips, no doubt, felt that it was
							beyond his depth, and yielded himself to the views of the leading men of
							his council. Stoughton was in full sympathy with Cotton Mather, whose
							interest had been used in procuring his appointment over Danforth.
							Through him, Mather acquired, and held for some time, great ascendency
								<pb n="251" id="vII251"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2256">
								<figDesc>Page 251.</figDesc>
							</figure> with the governor. It was concluded best to appoint a special
							court of Oyer and Terminer for the witchcraft trials. Stoughton, the
							deputy-governor, was commissioned as chief-justice. Nathaniel
							Saltonstall` of Haverhill; Major John Richards of Boston; Major
							Bartholomew Gedney of Salem; Mr. Wait Winthrop, Captain Samuel Sewall,
							and Mr. Peter Sargent, all three of Boston, — were made associate
							judges. Saltonstall early withdrew from the service; and Jonathan
							Corwin, of Salem, succeeded to his place on the bench of the special
							court. A majority of the judges were citizens of Boston.</p>
						<p>Jonathan Corwin had been associated with Hathorne in conducting the
							examinations that have been described. He was a son of George Corwin,
							who has been noticed in the account of Salem Village.</p>
						<p>A shade of illegality rests upon the very existence of this special
							court. There has always been a question whether the new charter gave to
							the governor and council power to create it without the concurrence of
							the House of Representatives. It has been held that such a court could
							have no other lawful foundation than an act of the General Court.
							Hutchinson was evidently of this opinion. This question was a very
							serious one; for, as that considerate and able historian and eminent
							judicial officer says, the tribunal that passed sentence in the
							witchcraft prosecutions was “the most important court to the life of the
							subject which was ever held in the province.” The time required to
							convene the popular branch of the <pb n="252" id="vII252"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2257">
								<figDesc>Page 252.</figDesc>
							</figure> government is itself, in all cases, an element of safety. In
							this case, it would have carried the country beyond the period of the
							delusion, and saved its annals from their darkest and bloodiest page.
							The condition of things when he arrived, had his counsellors been wise,
							would have led Sir William Phips forthwith to issue writs of election of
							deputies, before taking any action whatever. In a free republican
							government, the executive department ought never to attempt to dispose
							of difficult matters of vital importance without the joint deliberations
							and responsibility of the representatives of the people.</p>
						<p>So far as the composition of the court is considered, no objection can be
							made. The justices were all members of the council, and belonged to the
							highest order, not only of the magistracy, but of society generally.
							They constituted as respectable a body of gentlemen as could have been
							collected. Thomas Newton, of Boston, was commissioned to act as
							attorney. The official title of marshal ceasing with the new government,
							George Corwin was appointed sheriff of the county of Essex. Herrick
							appears to have continued in the service as deputy. Sheriff Corwin was
							twenty-six years of age. He was the grandson of the original George
							Corwin, and the son of John. His mother was grand-daughter of Governor
							Winthrop of Massachusetts, and daughter of Governor Winthrop of
							Connecticut. His wife was a daughter of Bartholomew Gedney; so that it
							appears that two of the judges were his uncles, and one his <pb n="253"
								id="vII253"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2258">
								<figDesc>Page 253.</figDesc>
							</figure> father-in-law. These personal connections may be borne in
							mind, as affording ground to believe, that, in the discharge of his
							painful duties, he did not act without advice and suggestions from the
							highest quarter.</p>
						<p>The court-house in which the trials were held stood in the middle of what
							is now Washington Street, near where Lynde and Church Streets, which did
							not then exist, now enter it, fronting towards Essex Street. The
							building was also used as a town-house; Washington Street being, for
							this reason, then called “Town Lane.” Off against the court-house, on
							the west side of the lane, was the house of the Rev. Nicholas Noyes, on
							the site of the residence of the late Robert Brookhouse. Opposite to it
							was the estate of Edward Bishop, which fronted westerly on “Town Lane” a
							little over a hundred feet, including the present Jeffrey Court, and
							extending a few feet beyond the corner of the house of Dr. S. M. Cate,
							over a portion of Church Street. Its depth, towards St. Peter Street,
							was about three hundred and forty feet. Edward Bishop held this estate
							in the right of his wife Bridget, the widow of Thomas Oliver who had
							died about 1679. Not long after this marriage, Bishop removed to his
							farm at Royal Side. In 1685, the “old Oliver house” was either removed
							or rebuilt, and a new one erected on the same premises, which was
							occupied by tenants in 1692. These items are given because they will
							help to illustrate the narrative, and enable us to understand points of
							evidence in the approaching trial. It is a curious <pb n="254"
								id="vII254"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2259">
								<figDesc>Page 254.</figDesc>
							</figure> circumstance, that the first public victim of the
							prosecutions, Bridget Bishop, had been the nearest neighbor and lived
							directly opposite, to the person who, more than any other inhabitant of
							the town, was responsible for the blood that was shed, — Nicholas Noyes.
							The jail, at that time, was on the western side of Prison Lane, now St.
							Peter Street, north of the point where Federal Street now enters it. The
							meeting-house stood on what has always been the site of the First
							Church. The “Ship Tavern” was on ground the front of which is occupied,
							at present, by “West's Block,” nearly opposite the head of Central
							Street. It had long been owned and kept by John Gedney, Sr. Two of his
							sons, John and Bartholomew, had married Susanna and Hannah Clarke. John
							died in 1685. His widow moved into the family of her father; and, after
							his death in 1688, continued to keep the house. In 1698 she was married
							to Deliverance Parkman, and died in 1728. The tavern, in 1692, was known
							as the “Widow Gedney's.” The estate had an extensive orchard in the
							rear, contiguous, along its northern boundary, to the orchard of Bridget
							Bishop, which occupied ground now covered by the Lyceum building, and
							one or two others to the east of it.</p>
						<p>The Court was opened at Salem in the first week of June, 1692. In the
							mean time, the attorney-general, to prepare for the management of the
							cases, came to Salem. He addressed the following letter to Isaac
							Addington, Secretary of the province: —</p>

						<p>Hutchinson says that there was no colony or province law against
							witchcraft in force when the trials began; and that the proceedings were
							under an act of James the First, passed in 1603. By that act, persons
							convicted were to be sentenced to “the pains and penalties of death as
							felons.” By the colonial law, conviction of capital crimes did not
							incapacitate the party affected from disposing of property. In this and
							other respects, there were points of difference, which caused some
							inconvenience in carrying out the practice of the mother-country; and
							the attorney-general had to supply the want of experience in the local
							officers.</p>
						<p>It may here be mentioned, that no record of the doings of this special
							court are now to be found, and our only information respecting them is
							obtained in brief and imperfect statements of writers of the time.
							Perhaps Hutchinson had the use of the records. He gives the dates of the
							several sessions of the courts, and of the conviction and execution of
							the prisoners. Some of the depositions sworn to in court are on file,
							but without giving in many instances the date when thus offered in the
							trials. In some cases, they state when they were laid before the grand
							jury. Only a small part of them are preserved. The matter they contain
							was, to a considerable extent, brought forward at the preliminary
							examinations, and has been already adduced. In the following account of
							the trials, some further use will be made of these depositions.</p>
						<p>Bridget Bishop was the only person tried at the first session of the
							Court. She was brought through <pb n="257" id="vII257"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2262">
								<figDesc>Page 257.</figDesc>
							</figure> Prison Lane, up Essex Street, by the First Church, into
							Town-house Lane, to the Court-house. Cotton Mather says, —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“There was one strange thing with which the court was newly
								entertained. As this woman was under a guard, passing by the great
								and spacious meeting-house, she gave a look towards the house; and
								immediately a demon, invisibly entering the meeting-house, tore down
								a part of it: so that, though there was no person to be seen there,
								yet the people, at the noise, running in, found a board, which was
								strongly fastened with several nails, transported into another
								quarter of the house.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>It is probable that the streets were thronged by crowds eager to get a
							sight of the prisoner; and that the doors, fences, and house-tops were
							occupied. Some, perhaps, got into the meeting-house; and, in clambering
							up to the windows, a board may have been put in requisition, and left
							misplaced. Incredible almost as it is, this circumstance seems, from
							Mather's language, — “the court was entertained,” — to have been brought
							in evidence at the trial, and regarded as weighty and conclusive proof
							of Bridget's guilt.</p>
						<p>One or two points in the evidence adduced against her, in addition to
							those mentioned heretofore, deserve consideration. The position taken,
							at her trial, by the Rev. John Hale of Beverly demands criticism. The
							charge of witchcraft had been made against her on more than one occasion
							before; particularly about the year 1687, when she resided near the
							bounds of Beverly, at Royal Side. A woman in the neighborhood, <pb
								n="258" id="vII258"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2263">
								<figDesc>Page 258.</figDesc>
							</figure> subject to fits of insanity, had, while passing into one of
							them, brought the accusation against her; but, on the return of her
							reason, solemnly recanted, and deeply lamented the aspersion. In a
							violent recurrence of her malady, this woman committed suicide. Mr. Hale
							had examined the case at the time, and exonerated Bridget Bishop, who
							was a communicant in his church, from the charge made against her by the
							unhappy lunatic. He was satisfied, as he states, that “Sister Bishop”
							was innocent, and in no way deserved to be ill thought of. He hoped
							“better of said Goody Bishop at that time.” Without any pretence of new
							evidence touching the facts of the case, he came into court in 1692, and
							related them, to the effect and with the intent to make them bear
							against her. He described the appearance of the throat of the woman,
							after death, as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“As to the wounds she died of, I observed three deadly ones; a piece
								of her windpipe cut out, and another wound above that through the
								windpipe and gullet, and the vein they call jugular. So that I then
								judged and still do apprehend it impossible for her, with so short a
								pair of scissors, to mangle herself so without some extraordinary
								work of the Devil or witchcraft.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>If this was his impression at the time, it is strange that he did not
							then say so. But there is no appearance of any criminal proceedings
							having been had, by the grand jury or otherwise, against “Sister Bishop”
							on the occasion. On the contrary, Mr. Hale seems to have acquiesced in
							the opinion, that the derangement of <pb n="259" id="vII259"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2264">
								<figDesc>Page 259.</figDesc>
							</figure> the woman was aggravated, if not caused, by her being overmuch
							given to searching and pondering upon the dark passages and mysterious
							imagery of prophecy. The truth, in all probability, is, that Mr. Hale's
							suspicion was an after-thought. The effect produced upon his mental
							condition by the statements and actings of the “afflicted children” in
							1692 was unconsciously transferred to 1687. The delusion, in which he
							was then fully participating, led him to put a different interpretation
							upon the suicidal wounds and horrible end of the wretched maniac, five
							or six years before.</p>
						<p>A piece of evidence, which illustrates the state of opinion at that time,
							relating to our subject, given in this case, is worthy of notice. Samuel
							Shattuck was a hatter and dyer. His house was on the south side of Essex
							Street, opposite the western entrance to the grounds of the North
							Church. Before her removal to the village, Bridget Bishop was in the
							habit of calling at Shattuck's to have articles of dress dyed. He states
							that she treated him and his family politely and kindly; or, as he
							characterized her deportment after his mind had become jaundiced against
							her, “in a smooth and flattering manner.” He tells his story in a
							deposition written by him, and signed and sworn to in Court by himself
							and wife, June 2, 1692. It is as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Our eldest child, who promised as much health and understanding,
								both by countenance and actions, as any other children of his years,
								was taken in a very drooping <pb n="260" id="vII260"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2265">
									<figDesc>Page 260.</figDesc>
								</figure> condition; and, as she came oftener to the house, he grew
								worse and worse. As he would be standing at the door, would fall
								out, and bruise his face upon a great step-stone, as if he had been
								thrust out by an invisible hand; oftentimes falling, and hitting his
								face against the sides of the house, bruising his face in a very
								miserable manner.... This child taken in a terrible fit, his mouth
								and eyes drawn aside, and gasped in such a manner as if he was upon
								the point of death. After this, he grew worse in his fits, and, out
								of them, would be almost always crying. That, for many months, he
								would be crying till nature's strength was spent, and then would
								fall asleep, and then awake, and fall to crying and moaning; and
								that his very countenance did bespeak compassion. And at length, we
								perceived his understanding decayed: so that we feared (as it has
								since proved) that he would be quite bereft of his wits; for, ever
								since, he has been stupefied and void of reason, his fits still
								following of him. After he had been in this kind of sickness some
								time, he has gone into the garden, and has got upon a board of an
								inch thick, which lay flat upon the ground, and we have called him;
								he would come to the edge of the board, and hold out his hand, and
								make as if he would come, but could not till he was helped off the
								board.... My wife has offered him a cake and money to come to her;
								and he has held out his hand, and reached after it, but could not
								come till he had been helped off the board, by which I judge some
								enchantment kept him on.... Ever since, this child hath been
								followed with grievous fits, as if he would never recover more; his
								head and eyes drawn aside so as if they would never come to rights
								more; lying as if he were, in a manner, dead; falling anywhere,
								either into fire or water, if he be not constantly looked to; and,
								generally, in such an uneasy, <pb n="261" id="vII261"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2266">
									<figDesc>Page 261.</figDesc>
								</figure> restless frame, almost always running to and fro, acting
								so strange that I cannot judge otherwise but that he is bewitched:
								and, by these circumstances, do believe that the aforesaid Bridget
								Oliver — now called Bishop — is the cause of it: and it has been the
								judgment of doctors, such as lived here and foreigners, that he is
								under an evil hand of witchcraft.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>The means used to give this direction to the suspicions of Shattuck and
							his wife are described in the notice of Bridget Bishop, in the First
							Part of this work.</p>
						<p>Shattuck was a son of the sturdy Quaker of that name who, thirty years
							before, had given the government of the colony so much trouble, and
							seems to have inherited some of his notions. In his deposition, he
							mentions, as corroborative proof of Bridget Bishop's being a witch, that
							she used to bring to his dye-house “sundry pieces of lace,” of shapes
							and dimensions entirely outside of his conceptions of what could be
							needed in the wardrobe, or for the toilet, of a plain and honest woman.
							He evidently regarded fashionable and vain apparel as a snare and sign
							of the Devil.</p>
						<p>The imaginations of several persons in Shattuck's immediate neighborhood
							seem to have been wrought up to a high point against Bridget Bishop.
							John Cook lived on the south side of the street, directly opposite the
							eastern entrance to the grounds of the North Church, on its present
							site. John Bly's house was on a lot contiguous to the rear of Cook's,
							fronting on Summer Street. One of Cook's sons (John), aged eighteen,
							testified, that, —</p>

						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“About five or six years ago, one morning about sun, as I was in bed,
								before I rose, I saw Goodwife Bishop, <hi rend="italics">alias</hi>
								Oliver, stand in the chamber by the window: and she looked on me and
								grinned on me, and presently struck me on the side of the head,
								which did very much hurt me; and then I saw her go out under the end
								window at a little crevice, about so big as I could thrust my hand
								into. I saw her again the same day, — which was the sabbath-day, —
								about noon, walk across the room; and having, at the time, an apple
								in my hand, it flew out of my hand into my mother's lap, who sat six
								or eight foot distance from me, and then she disappeared: and,
								though my mother and several others were in the same room, yet they
								affirmed they saw her not.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Bly and his wife Rebecca had a difficulty with Bishop in reference to
							payment for a hog they had bought of her. The following is from their
							testimony at her trial. After stating that she came to their house and
							quarrelled with them about it, they go on to say that the animal —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“was taken with strange fits, jumping up, and knocking her head
								against the fence, and seemed blind and deaf, and would not eat,
								neither let her pigs suck, but foamed at the mouth; which Goody
								Henderson, hearing of, said she believed she was overlooked, and
								that they had their cattle ill in such a manner at the Eastward,
								when they lived there, and used to cure them by giving of them red
								ochre and milk, which we also gave the sow. Quickly after eating of
								which, she grew better; and then, for the space of near two hours
								together, she, getting into the street, did set off, jumping and
								running between the house of said deponents and said Bishop's, as if
									<pb n="263" id="vII263"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2268">
									<figDesc>Page 263.</figDesc>
								</figure> she were stark mad, and, after that, was well again: and
								we did then apprehend or judge, and do still, that said Bishop had
								bewitched said sow.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>William Stacey testified, that, as he was “agoing to mill,” meeting
							Bishop in the street, some conversation passed between them, and that,
							—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“being gone about six rods from her, the said Bishop, with a small
								load in his cart, suddenly the off-wheel slumped or sunk down into a
								hole upon plain ground; that this deponent was forced to get one to
								help him get the wheel out. Afterwards, this deponent went back to
								look for said hole where his wheel sunk in, but could not find any
								hole.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Stacey further deposed, that, on another occasion, he —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“met the said Bishop by Isaac Stearns's brick-kiln. After he had
								passed by her, this deponent's horse stood still with a small load
								going up the hill; so that, the horse striving to draw, all his
								gears and tackling flew in pieces, and the cart fell down.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>These mishaps and marvels occurred in Summer Street, near the foot of
							Chestnut Street, where the ground was then much lower than it is now.
							Stacey was ascending the street, on his way through High Street to his
							father's mill, at the South River.</p>
						<p>Stacey concluded his testimony as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“This deponent hath met with several other of her pranks at several
								times, which would take up a great time to tell of.</p>
							<p>“This deponent doth verily believe that the said Bridget Bishop was
								instrumental to his daughter Priscilla's death. <pb n="264"

								</figure> About two years ago, the child was a likely, thriving
								child; and suddenly screeched out, and so continued, in an unusual
								manner, for about a fortnight, and so died in that lamentable
								manner.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Many of the extraordinary “pranks,” charged upon Bridget Bishop, had
							their scene near to her dwellinghouse. John Louder, a servant of John
							Gedney, Sr., some years before, had a controversy with her about her
							fowls, “that used to come into our orchard or garden.” He swore as
							follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Some little time after which, I, going well to bed, about the dead
								of the night, felt a great weight upon my breast, and, awakening,
								looked; and, it being bright moonlight, did clearly see said Bridget
								Bishop, or her likeness, sitting upon my stomach; and, putting my
								arms off of the bed to free myself from the great oppression, she
								presently laid hold of my throat, and almost choked me, and I had no
								strength or power in my hands to resist, or help myself; and, in
								this condition, she held me to almost day. Some time after this, my
								mistress (Susannah Gedney) was in our orchard, and I was then with
								her; and said Bridget Bishop, being then in her orchard, — which was
								next adjoining to ours, — my mistress told said Bridget that I said
								or affirmed that she came, one night, and sat upon my breast, as
								aforesaid, which she denied, and I affirmed to her face to be true,
								and that I did plainly see her; upon which discourse with her, she
								threatened me. And, some time after that, I, being not very well,
								stayed at home on a Lord's Day; and, on the afternoon of said day,
								the doors being shut, I did see a black pig in the room coming
								towards me; so I went towards it to kick it, and it vanished
								away.”</p>

						<pb n="265" id="vII265"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2270">
								<figDesc>Page 265.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>Louder goes on to say, that, immediately after this, on the same occasion
							while he was staying at home from meeting, he saw a black thing jump
							into the window, and it came and stood just before his face “upon the
							bar.” The body of it looked like a monkey, only the feet were like a
							cock's feet with claws, and the face somewhat more like a man's than a
							monkey's. He says that he was greatly affrighted, “not being able to
							speak or help myself by reason of fear, I suppose;” and that his
							mysterious visitor made quite a speech to him, representing that it was
							a messenger sent to say, that, if he would “be ruled by him, he should
							want for nothing in this world.” The virtuous and indignant Louder says
							that he answered, “You devil, I will kill you!” and gave it a blow with
							his fist, but “could feel no substance; and it jumped out of the window
							again.” It immediately came in by the porch, although the doors were
							shut, and said, “You had better take my counsel.” Hereupon Louder struck
							at it with a stick, hitting the ground-sill and breaking the stick, but
							felt no substance. Louder concludes his testimony as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“The arm with which I struck was presently disenabled. Then it
								vanished away, and I opened the back-door and went out; and, going
								towards the house-end, I espied said Bridget Bishop in her orchard
								going towards her house, and, seeing her, had no power to set one
								foot forward, but returned in again: and, going to shut the door, I
								again did see that or the like creature, that I before did see
								within doors, in such a posture as it seemed to be agoing to fly at
								me; <pb n="266" id="vII266"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2271">
									<figDesc>Page 266.</figDesc>
								</figure> upon which I cried out, `The whole armor of God be between
								me and you.' So it sprang back and flew over the appletree, flinging
								the dirt with its feet against my stomach, upon which I was struck
								dumb, and so continued for about three days' time; and also shook
								many of the apples off from the tree which it flew over.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Before removing to his farm, Edward and Bridget Bishop made the
							alterations, before mentioned, on their town estate. John Bly, Sr., aged
							fifty-seven years, and William Bly, aged fifteen, were employed in the
							operation of removing the cellar wall of “the ould house;” and
							testified, that they found in holes and crevices of said cellar wall
							“several puppets made up of rags and hogs' bristles, with headless pins
							in them with the points outward.”</p>
						<p>Upon such evidence, Bridget Bishop was condemned, and executed the next
							week. The death-warrants, in these trials, were collected together in
							one envelope, marked as such. The envelope remains, but its contents
							have all been abstracted. The death-warrant of Bridget Bishop was
							probably overlooked when the others were gathered together. The
							consequence is that it has been preserved, and is the only one known to
							be in existence.</p>
						<p>The sheriff seems to have proceeded, immediately after the execution, to
							the clerk's office, and indorsed his return on the warrant. When he
							wrote it, he added, after the word “dead,” — “and buried her on the
							spot.” On its occurring to him that the burying of the body was not
							mentioned in the warrant, he drew <pb/>

							superfluous clause, thus partially obliterated, is the only positive
							evidence we have of the disposal of the bodies at the time. They were
							undoubtedly all thrown into pits dug among the rocks, on the spot, and
							hastily covered by the officers having in charge the details of the
							executions. There were no prayers over their graves, except those
							uttered by themselves in their last moments.</p>
						<p>The descendants of Bridget Bishop are very numberous in Salem; embracing
							some of our oldest and most respectable families, and branching widely
							from them. There is no evidence of issue by her first marriage. Thomas
							Oliver, her second husband, had daughters by a former wife, who were
							represented in the next generation under the names of Hilliard, Hooper,
							and Jones. By his wife Bridget, he had but one child, — a daughter,
							Christian, born May 8, 1667. She married Thomas Mason, and died in 1693;
							leaving an only child, Susannah, born August 23, 1687. Edward Bishop was
							her guardian. She married John Becket in 1711, and by him had a son,
							John, and six daughters, as follows: Susannah, married to David Felt,
							Elizabeth to William Peele, Sarah to Nathaniel Silsbee, Rebecca to
							William Fairfield, Eunice to Thorndike Deland, and Hannah to William
							Cloutman.</p>
						<p>After the condemnation of Bridget Bishop, the Court took a recess, and
							consulted the ministers of Boston and the neighborhood respecting the
							prosecutions. The response of the reverend gentlemen, while urging, <pb
								n="268" id="vII268"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2275">
								<figDesc>Page 268.</figDesc>
							</figure> in general terms, the importance of caution and circumspection
							in the methods of examination, decidedly and earnestly recommended that
							the proceedings should be vigorously carried on; and they were, indeed,
							vigorously carried on.</p>
						<p>Hutchinson says, that, “at the first trial, there was no colony or
							provincial law against witchcraft in force. The statute of James the
							First must therefore have been considered as in force in the province,
							witchcraft not being an offence at common law. Before the adjournment,
							the old colony law, which makes witchcraft a capital offence, was
							revived with the other local laws, as they were called, and made a law
							of the province.” The General Court, which thus revived the law making
							witchcraft a capital offence, met, June 8, two days before the execution
							of Bridget Bishop. The proceedings that took place at Salem were thus
							assumed as a provincial matter, for which the immediate locality was not
							responsible, but the legislature, clergy, and people of the country at
							large.</p>
						<p>The Court met again on Wednesday, the 29th of June; and, after trial,
							sentenced to death Sarah Good, Sarah Wildes, Elizabeth How, Susanna
							Martin, and Rebecca Nurse, who were all executed on the 19th of
							July.</p>
						<p>Calef says, that, at the trial of Sarah Good, —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“One of the afflicted fell in a fit; and, after coming out of it,
								cried out of the prisoner for stabbing her in the breast with a
								knife, and that she had broken the knife in stabbing of her.
								Accordingly, a piece of the blade of a knife was <pb n="269"
									id="vII269"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2276">
									<figDesc>Page 269.</figDesc>
								</figure> found about her. Immediately, information being given to
								the Court, a young man was called, who produced a half and part of
								the blade, which the Court, having viewed and compared, saw it to be
								the same; and, upon inquiry, the young man affirmed that yesterday
								he happened to break that knife, and that he cast away the upper
								part, — this afflicted person being then present. The young man was
								dismissed and she was bidden by the Court not to tell lies; and was
								improved after (as she had been before) to give evidence against the
								prisoners.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Hutchinson, in relating this circumstance, refers to a case tried before
							Sir Matthew Hale, when a similar kind of falsehood was proved against an
							“afflicted” witness; notwithstanding which he says the person on trial
							was found guilty, “and the judge and all the court were fully satisfied
							with the verdict.”</p>
						<p>Sarah Good appears to have been an unfortunate woman, having been subject
							to poverty, and consequent sadness and melancholy. But she was not
							wholly broken in spirit. Mr. Noyes, at the time of her execution, urged
							her very strenuously to confess. Among other things, he told her “she
							was a witch, and that she knew she was a witch.” She was conscious of
							her innocence, and felt that she was oppressed, outraged, trampled upon,
							and about to be murdered, under the forms of law; and her indignation
							was roused against her persecutors. She could not bear in silence the
							cruel aspersion; and, although she was just about to be launched into
							eternity, the torrent of her feelings could not be restrained, but burst
							upon <pb n="270" id="vII270"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2277">
								<figDesc>Page 270.</figDesc>
							</figure> the head of him who uttered the false accusation. “You are a
							liar,” said she. “I am no more a witch than you are a wizard; and, if
							you take away my life, God will give you blood to drink.” Hutchinson
							says that, in his day, there was a tradition among the people of Salem,
							and it has descended to the present time, that the manner of Mr. Noyes's
							death strangely verified the prediction thus wrung from the incensed
							spirit of the dying woman. He was exceedingly corpulent, of a plethoric
							habit, and died of an internal hemorrhage, bleeding profusely at the
							mouth.</p>
						<p>We have no information relating to the execution of Elizabeth How. Her
							gentle, patient, humble, benignant, devout, and tender heart bore her,
							no doubt, with a spirit of saint-like love and faith, through the
							dreadful scenes. We cannot doubt, that, in death as in life, she
							forgave, prayed for, and invoked blessing upon her persecutors. Neither
							has any thing come down in reference to the deportment of Sarah Wildes
							or Susanna Martin. We may take it for granted, that the former was a
							patient and humble, but firm and faithful sufferer; and that the latter
							displayed the great energy of spirit, and probably the strength of
							language, for which she was remarkable. Of the case of Rebecca Nurse we
							have more information.</p>
						<p>The character, age, and position of this venerable matron created an
							impression, which called, to the utmost, all the arts and efforts of the
							prosecution to counteract. Many who had gone fully and earnestly in
							support of the proceedings against others paused <pb n="271" id="vII271"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2278">
								<figDesc>Page 271.</figDesc>
							</figure> and hesitated in reference to her; and large numbers who had
							been overawed into silence before, bravely came forward in her defence.
							The character of Nathaniel Putnam has been described. He was a man of
							extraordinary strength and acuteness of mind, and in all his previous
							life had been proof against popular excitement. The death of his brother
							Thomas, seven years before, had left him the head and patriarch of his
							great family: as such, he was known as “Landlord Putnam.” Entire
							confidence was felt by all in his judgment, and deservedly. But he was a
							strong religionist, a life-long member of the Church, and extremely
							strenuous and zealous in his ecclesiastical relations. He was getting to
							be an old man; and Mr. Parris had wholly succeeded in obtaining, for the
							time, possession of his feelings, sympathy, and zeal in the management
							of the Church, and secured his full co in the witchcraft prosecutions.
							He had been led by Parris to take the very front in the proceedings. But
							even Nathaniel Putnam could not stand by in silence, and see Rebecca
							Nurse sacrificed. A curious paper, written by him, is among those which
							have been preserved: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Nathaniel Putnam,</hi> Sr., being desired by

						<p>An examination of the foregoing names in connection with the history of
							the Village will show conclusive proof, that, if the matter had been
							left to the people there, it would never have reached the point to which
							it was carried. It was the influence of the magistracy and the
							government of the colony, and the public sentiment prevalent elsewhere,
							overruling that of the immediate locality, that drove on the storm.</p>
						<p>Israel Porter was the head of a great and powerful family. His wife
							Elizabeth was, as has been stated, a sister of Hathorne, the examining
							magistrate. Edward and Hannah Bishop were the venerable heads and
							founders of a large family. They lived in Beverly, and must each have
							been about ninety years of age. The list contains the names of the heads
							of the principal families in the village, — such as John and Rebecca
							Putnam, the Hutchinsons, Reas, Leaches, Houltons, and Herricks; and, in
							the neighborhood, such as the Feltons, Osbornes, and Samuel Endicott.
							The most remarkable fact it discloses is that it contains the name of
							one of the two complainants who procured the warrant against Rebecca
							Nurse, — Jonathan Putnam, the eldest son of John; and also of his wife
							Lydia. Subsequent reflection, and the return of his better judgment,
							satisfied him that he had done a great wrong to an innocent and worthy
							person; and he had the manliness to come out in her favor. This document
							ought to have been effectual in saving the life of Rebecca Nurse. It
							will for ever vindicate her character, and reflect honor upon each and
							every name subscribed to it.</p>

						<p>One of the most cruel features in the prosecution of the witchcraft
							trials, and which was practised in all countries where they took place,
							was the examination of the bodies of the prisoners by a jury of the same
							sex, under the direction and in the presence of a surgeon or physician.
							The person was wholly exposed, and every part subjected to the most
							searching scrutiny. The process was always an outrage upon human nature;
							and in the cases of the victims on this occasion, many of them of
							venerable years and delicate feelings, it was shocking to every natural
							and instinctive sentiment. There is reason to fear that it was often
							conducted in a rough, coarse, and brutal manner. Marshal Herrick
							testifies, that, “by order of Their Majesties' justices,” he,
							accompanied by the jail-keeper Dounton, and Constable Joseph Neal, made
							an examination of the body of George Jacobs. In persons of his great
							age, there would, in all likelihood, be shrivelled, desiccated, and
							callous places. They found one on the old man, under his right shoulder.
							Herrick made oath that it was a veritable witch teat, and his deposition
							describes it as follows: “About a quarter of an inch long or better,
							with a sharp point drooping downwards, so that I took a pin, and run it
							through the said teat; but there was neither water, blood, or
							corruption, nor any other matter.” As proof positive that this was “the
							Devil's mark,” Herrick and the turnkey testify that “the said jacobs was
							not in the least sensible of what had been done”!</p>
						<p>The mind loathes the thought of handling in this <pb n="275" id="vII275"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2282">
								<figDesc>Page 275.</figDesc>
							</figure> way refined and sensitive females of matronly character, or
							persons of either sex, with infirmities of body rendered sacred by
							years. The results of the examination were reduced to written reports,
							going into details, and, among other evidences in the trials, spread
							before the Court and jury.<note target="v2n3" place="unspecified"
								anchored="yes">*</note></p>
						<p>The evidence in the case of Rebecca Nurse was made up of the usual
							representations and actings of the “afflicted children.” Mary Walcot and
							Abigail Williams charged her with having committed several murders;
							mentioning particularly Benjamin Houlton, John Harwood, and Rebecca
							Shepard, and averring that she was aided therein by her sister Cloyse.
							Mr. Parris, too, gave in a deposition against her; from which it
							appears, <pb n="276" id="vII276"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2283">
								<figDesc>Page 276.</figDesc>
							</figure> that, a certain person being sick, Mercy Lewis was sent for.
							She was struck dumb on entering the chamber. She was asked to hold up
							her hand, if she saw any of the witches afflicting the patient.
							Presently she held up her hand, then fell into a trance; and after a
							while, coming to herself, said that she saw the spectres of Goody Nurse
							and Goody Carrier having hold of the head of the sick man. Mr. Parris
							swore to this statement with the utmost confidence in Mercy's
							declarations.</p>
						<p>The testimony of three persons particularly is required to be given, as
							illustrating the extraordinary extent to which the minds of those
							involved in the affair were under infatuation or hallucination.</p>
						<p>Mrs. Ann Putnam was about thirty years of age. For six months she had
							been constantly absorbed in what was then, as now, regarded as
							spiritualism. Her <pb n="277" id="vII277"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2284">
								<figDesc>Page 277.</figDesc>
							</figure> house had been the scene of a perpetual series of wonders
							supposed to be disclosures and manifestations of a supernatural
							character. Apparitions, spectral shapes of living witches, ghosts of
							their murdered victims, and demons generally, were of daily and hourly
							occurrence. The dread secrets of the world unknown had been revealed to
							her in waking fancies and dreams by night. An originally sensitive and
							imaginative nature had been wrought into a condition in which her mental
							faculties were at once enfeebled and exalted. Besides all this, there
							were the trials to which her constitution had been subjected by the
							experiences of maternity so early begun, and the pressure upon her mind
							and heart of the anxieties and cares incident to a large family of young
							children. An accumulation of disappointments, vexations, and consuming
							griefs, spread like a dark cloud over her life, — the deaths of her own
							children, and of her sister Bayley and her children, and of her sister
							Baker's children; and, finally, the long-continued, and constantly
							recurring sufferings, tortures, convulsions, fits, and trances of her
							daughter Ann, and her servant-woman Mercy Lewis, under, as she fully
							believed, a diabolical hand. — These things must have given to her
							countenance and tones of voice a wonderful impressiveness to all who
							looked upon or listened to them. Her eminent social position, her
							general reputation, — for Lawson, who knew her well, calls her “a very
							sober and pious woman,” so far as he could judge, — the stamp of
							profound earnestness marked on all her <pb n="278" id="vII278"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2285">
								<figDesc>Page 278.</figDesc>
							</figure> language, the glow which morbid excitement long experienced
							gave to her expression, must have arrested, to a high degree, the
							attention of the assembled multitude. An air of sadness, in the wild
							ravings of imagination, pervades her testimony. I present her deposition
							in full, as one of the phenomena of this strange transaction: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Ann Putnam,</hi> the wife of
								Thomas Putnam, aged about thirty years, who testifieth and saith,
								that, on the 18th March, 1692, I being wearied out in helping to
								tend my poor afflicted child and maid, about the middle of the
								afternoon I lay me down on the bed to take a little rest; and
								immediately I was almost pressed and choked to death, that, had it
								not been for the mercy of a gracious God and the help of those that
								were with me, I could not have lived many moments: and presently I
								saw the apparition of Martha Corey, who did torture me so as I
								cannot express, ready to tear me all to pieces, and then departed
								from me a little while; but, before I could recover strength or well
								take breath, the apparition of Martha Corey fell upon me again with
								dreadful tortures, and hellish temptation to go along with her. And
								she also brought to me a little red book in her hand and a black
								pen, urging me vehemently to write in her book; and several times
								that day she did most grievously torture me, almost ready to kill
								me. And, on the 19th March, Martha Corey again appeared to me; and
								also Rebecca Nurse, the wife of Francis Nurse, Sr.: and they both
								did torture me a great many times this day with such tortures as no
								tongue can express, because I would not yield to their hellish
								temptations, that, had I not been upheld by an Almighty arm, I could
								not have lived <pb n="279" id="vII279"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2286">
									<figDesc>Page 279.</figDesc>
								</figure> while night. The 20th March, being sabbath-day, I had a
								great deal of respite between my fits. 21st March, being the day of
								the examination of Martha Corey, I had not many fits, though I was
								very weak; my strength being, as I thought, almost gone: but, on the
								22d March, 1692, the apparition of Rebecca Nurse did again set upon
								me in a most dreadful manner, very early in the morning, as soon as
								it was well light. And now she appeared to me only in her shift, and
								brought a little red book in her hand, urging me vehemently to write
								in her book; and, because I would not yield to her hellish
								temptations, she threatened to tear my soul out of my body,
								blasphemously denying the blessed God, and the power of the Lord
								Jesus Christ to save my soul; and denying several places of
								Scripture which I told her of, to repel her hellish temptations. And
								for near two hours together, at this time, the apparition of Rebecca
								Nurse did tempt and torture me, and also the greater part of this
								day, with but very little respite. 23d March, am again afflicted by
								the apparitions of Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey, but chiefly by
								Rebecca Nurse. 24th March, being the day of the examination of
								Rebecca Nurse, I was several times afflicted in the morning by the
								apparition of Rebecca Nurse, but most dreadfully tortured by her in
								the time of her examination, insomuch that the honored magistrates
								gave my husband leave to carry me out of the meeting; and, as soon
								as I was carried out of the meeting doors, it pleased Almighty God,
								for his free grace and mercy's sake, to deliver me out of the paws
								of those roaring lions, and jaws of those tearing bears, that, ever
								since that time, they have not had power so to afflict me until this
								31st May, 1692. At the same moment that I was hearing my evidence
								read by the honored magistrates, to take my <pb n="280" id="vII280"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2287">
									<figDesc>Page 280.</figDesc>
								</figure> oath, I was again re-assaulted and tortured by my
								beforementioned tormentor, Rebecca Nurse.”</p>
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Ann Putnam,</hi> Jr.,
								witnesseth and saith, that, being in the room when her mother was
								afflicted, she saw Martha Corey, Sarah Cloyse, and Rebecca Nurse, or
								their apparition, upon her mother.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Mrs. Ann Putnam made another deposition under oath, at the same trial,
							which shows that she was determined to overwhelm the prisoner by the
							multitude of her charges. She says that Rebecca Nurse's apparition
							declared to her that “she had killed Benjamin Houlton, John Fuller, and
							Rebecca Shepard;” and that she and her sister Cloyse, and Edward Bishop
							wife, had killed young John Putnam's child; and she further deposed as
							followeth: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Immediately there did appear to me six children in winding-sheets,
								which called me aunt, which did most grievously affright me; and
								they told me that they were my sister Baker's children of Boston;
								and that Goody Nurse, and Mistress Carey of Charlestown, and an old
								deaf woman at Boston, had murdered them, and charged me to go and
								tell these things to the magistrates, or else they would tear me to
								pieces, for their blood did cry for vengeance. Also there appeared
								to me my own sister Bayley and three of her children in
								winding-sheets, and told me that Goody Nurse had murdered them.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>There is in this deposition a passage which illustrates one of the
							doctrines held at the time on the subject of witchcraft. Mrs. Ann Putnam
							“testifieth and saith, that, on the first day of June, 1692, the <pb
								n="281" id="vII281"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2288">
								<figDesc>Page 281.</figDesc>
							</figure> apparition of Rebecca Nurse did again fall upon me, and almost
							choke me; and she told me, that, now she was come out of prison, she had
							power to afflict me, and that now she would afflict me all this day
							long.” The reference here is probably to the fact, that, on the 1st of
							June, she with many other prisoners was transferred from the jail in
							Boston to that in Salem; and that, “all that day long” being outside of
							prison walls, she had greater power to afflict than when chained in a
							cell. This was undoubtedly the received opinion, and it is curiously

						<p>The only breath of disparagement against the character of Goodwife Nurse

							—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Sarah Houlton,</hi> relict of
								Benjamin Houlton, deceased, who testifieth and saith, that, about
								this time three years, my dear and loving husband, Benjamin Houlton,
								deceased, was as well as ever I knew him in my life till one
								Saturday morning, that Rebecca Nurse, who now stands charged for
								witchcraft, came to our house, and fell a railing at him because our
								pigs got into her field. Though our pigs were sufficiently yoked,
								and their fence was down in several places, yet all we could say to
								her could no ways pacify her; but she continued railing and scolding
								a great while together, calling to her son Benj. Nurse to go and get
								a gun and kill our pigs, and let none of them go out of the field,
								though my poor husband gave her never a misbeholding word. And,
								within a short time after this, my poor husband going out very early
								in the morning, as he <pb n="282" id="vII282"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2289">
									<figDesc>Page 282.</figDesc>
								</figure> was coming in again, he was taken with a strange fit in
								the entry; being struck blind and stricken down two or three times,
								so that, when he came to himself, he told me he thought he should
								never have come into the house any more. And, all summer after, he
								continued in a languishing condition, being much pained at his
								stomach, and often struck blind: but, about a fortnight before he
								died, he was taken with strange and violent fits, acting much like
								to our poor bewitched persons when we thought they would have died;
								and the doctor that was with him could not find what his distemper
								was. And, the day before he died, he was very cheerly; but, about
								midnight, he was again most violently seized upon with violent fits,
								till the next night, about midnight, he departed this life by a
								cruel death.</p>
							<p>“<hi rend="italics">Jurat in Curia.</hi>”</p>
						</q>
						<p>In explanation of the import of this testimony, it is to be observed,
							that the estate of Benjamin Houlton was contiguous to that of Francis
							Nurse. They were separated by a fence, which, as in such cases, was
							required for half its length to be kept in order by one party, the
							remaining half by the other. What the exact facts were cannot be
							ascertained, as we have the story of one side only. The widow Houlton
							appears to have been a tender-hearted, and, for aught we know, good
							woman. Some years afterwards, she was married, as his second wife, to
							Benjamin Putnam, — a very respectable person, and, on the death of his
							father Nathaniel, the head of that branch of the family. He was, for
							many years, deacon of the church. But she was, it must be conceded, a
							prejudiced witness; and <pb n="283" id="vII283"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2290">
								<figDesc>Page 283.</figDesc>
							</figure> her judgment for the time was wholly beclouded by the
							prevalent superstitions. The garden had been, from the days of Townsend
							Bishop, a choice portion of the Nurse estate. In all farms, it was a
							most important and valuable item; and was generally under the special
							care and management of the wife, daughters, and younger lads of the
							husbandman. Rebecca Nurse was an efficient helpmeet; contributing her
							whole share to the success of the great enterprise of clearing the
							estate, as well as in bringing up and educating a large family. It was,
							no doubt, very provoking to her, as it would be to any one, to have
							vegetable and flower beds devastated by the ravages of a neighbor's
							stray pigs. To what extent her “railing and scolding” went, she was not
							allowed to contribute her statement, to enable us to judge. The affair
							probably produced considerable gossip, and seems to be alluded to in
							Nathaniel Putnam's certificate in behalf of Rebecca Nurse. There is
							reason to believe that the widow Houlton was one of the first to realize
							what great injustice had been done by her and others to the good name of
							Rebecca Nurse.</p>
						<p>Notwithstanding this evidence, so deeply were the jury impressed with the
							eminent virtue and true Christian excellence of this venerable woman,
							that, in spite of the clamors of the outside crowd, the monstrous
							statements of accusing witnesses, and the strong leaning of the Court
							against her, the jury brought in a verdict of “Not guilty.” Calef, and
							Hutchinson after him, describe the effect, and what followed: —</p>
						<pb n="284" id="vII284"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2291">
								<figDesc>Page 284.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Immediately, all the accusers in the Court, and, suddenly after, all
								the afflicted out of Court, made an hideous outcry; to the
								amazement, not only of the spectators, but the Court also seemed
								strangely surprised. One of the judges expressed himself not
								satisfied: another of them, as he was going off the bench, said they
								would have her indicted anew, The chief-justice said he would not
								impose on the jury, but intimated as if they had not well considered
								one expression of the prisoner when she was upon trial; viz., that
								when one Hobbs, who had confessed herself to be a witch, was brought
								into Court to witness against her, the prisoner, turning her head to
								her, said, `What! do you bring her? She is one of us;' or words to
								that effect. This, together with the clamors of the accusers,
								induced the jury to go out again, after their verdict, `Not
								guilty.”'</p>
						</q>
						<p>The foreman of the jury, Thomas Fisk, made this statement on the 4th of
							July, a few days after the trial: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“After the honored Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the
								verdict, several of the jury declared themselves desirous to go out
								again, and thereupon the Court gave leave; but, when we came to
								consider the case, I could not tell how to take her words as an
								evidence against her, till she had a further opportunity to put her
								sense upon them, if she would take it. And then, going into Court, I
								mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court were
								affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the bar, but
								made no reply nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were
								to me a principal evidence against her.”</p>
						</q>
						<pb n="285" id="vII285"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2292">
								<figDesc>Page 285.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>Upon being informed of the use made of her words, the prisoner put in the
							following declaration: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“These presents do humbly show to the honored Court and jury, that I
								being informed that the jury brought me in guilty upon my saying
								that Goodwife Hobbs and her daughter were of our company; but I
								intended no otherwise than as they were prisoners with us, and
								therefore did then, and yet do, judge them not legal evidence
								against their fellow-prisoners. And I being something hard of
								hearing and full of grief, none informing me how the Court took up
								my words, and therefore had no opportunity to declare what I
								intended when I said they were of our company.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>It was perfectly natural for her to have spoken of them as “of our
							company,” not only from the fact that they had long been crowded
							together in the same jails, but as they had accompanied each other in
							the transferrence from one jail to another, from time to time. A few
							days before, a large party, of which she was one, had been brought from
							Boston, spending the whole day together on the route. Sarah Good, John
							Procter and wife, Susanna Martin, Bridget Bishop, and Alice Parker
							happen to be mentioned as belonging to it. Calef further states: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“After her condemnation, the governor saw cause to grant a reprieve,
								which, when known (and some say immediately upon granting), the
								accusers renewed their dismal outcries against her; insomuch that
								the governor was by some Salem gentlemen prevailed with to recall
								the reprieve, and she was executed with the rest.</p>
							<pb n="286" id="vII286"/>
							<p>
								<figure id="Uphv2293">
									<figDesc>Page 286.</figDesc>
								</figure>
							</p>
							<p>“The testimonials of her Christian behavior, both in the course of
								her life and at her death, and her extraordinary care in educating
								her children, and setting them a good example, under the hands of so
								many, are so numerous, that for brevity they are here omitted.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>The extraordinary conduct of “the Salem gentlemen,” in preventing the
							intended exercise of executive discretion and clemency on this occasion,
							is explained, it is probable, by the fact, stated by Neal in his
							“History of New England,” that there was an organized association of
							private individuals, a committee of vigilance, in Salem, during the
							continuance of the delusion, who had undertaken to ferret out and
							prosecute all suspected persons. He says that many were arrested and
							thrown into prison by their influence and interference. It is hardly to
							be doubted, that the persons who busied themselves to prevent the
							reprieve of Rebecca Nurse acted under the authority and by the direction
							of this self-constituted body of inquisitors. The agency of such
							unauthorized and irresponsible combinations is always of questionable
							expediency. When acting in the same line with an excited populace, they
							are extremely dangerous.</p>
						<p>There is no more disgraceful record in the judicial annals of the
							country, than that which relates the trial of this excellent woman. The
							wave of popular fury made a clear breach over the judgment-seat. The
							loud and malignant outcry of an infatuated mob, inside and outside of
							the Court-house, instead of being yielded to, ought to have been, not
							only sternly rebuked, but <pb n="287" id="vII287"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2294">
								<figDesc>Page 287.</figDesc>
							</figure> visited with prompt and exemplary punishment. The judges were
							not only overcome and intimidated from the faithful discharge of their
							sacred duty by a clamoring crowd, but they played into their hands.
							Hutchinson justly remarks, that their conduct was in violation of that
							rule to execute “law and justice in mercy,” which ought always to be
							written on their hearts. “In a capital case, the Court often refuses a
							verdict of `Guilty;' but rarely, if ever, sends a jury out again upon
							one of `Not guilty.”' The statement made by the foreman of the jury,
							with the subsequent explanation of the prisoner, taken in connection
							with the ground on which the chief-justice sent the jury out again after
							rendering their verdict of “Not guilty,” made it the duty of the Court
							and the executive to give to her the benefit of that verdict.</p>
						<p>At the trial of her mother, Sarah Nurse — aged twenty-eight years or
							thereabouts — offered this piece of testimony: that, “being in the
							Court, this 29th of June, 1692, I saw Goodwife Bibber pull pins out of
							her clothes, and held them between her fingers, and clasped her hands
							round her knee; and then she cried out, and said, Goody Nurse pinched
							her.” In all these trials, Mercy Lewis was a principal witness and
							actor; yet we find, among the papers, testimony from the most
							respectable and reliable persons, that she was not to be trusted. There
							was also testimony which ought to have broken the force of the
							depositions of Ann Putnam and her mother. Four days after the
							examination and commitment of Rebecca Nurse, John <pb n="288"
								id="vII288"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2295">
								<figDesc>Page 288.</figDesc>
							</figure> Tarbell and Samuel Nurse went to the house of Thomas Putnam to
							find out in what way their mother had been made the object of such
							shocking accusations. They were men whose credibility was never brought
							in question. Their declarations, on this occasion, were not disputed,
							and, if not true, might have been overthrown; for there were many
							witnesses of the facts they stated. Tarbell swore as follows: “Upon
							discourse of many things, I asked whether the girl that was afflicted
							did first speak of Goody Nurse, before others mentioned her to her. They
							said she told them she saw the apparition of a pale-faced woman that sat
							in her grandmother's seat, but did not know her name. Then I replied and
							said, `But who was it that told her that it was Goody Nurse?' Mercy
							Lewis said it was Goody Putnam that said it was Goody Nurse. Goody
							Putnam said that it was Mercy Lewis that told her. Thus they turned it
							upon one another, saying, `It was you,' and `It was you that told her.”'
							Samuel Nurse testified to the same.</p>
						<p>There was another piece of evidence, which, though brought against
							Rebecca Nurse, bears harder, as we read it now, upon Ann Putnam than any
							one else, and makes it more difficult to palliate her conduct on the
							supposition of partial insanity. It is, all along, one of the obscure
							problems of our subject to determine how far delusion may have been
							accompanied by fraud and imposture. Edward Putnam testified, that “Ann
							Putnam, Jr., was bitten by Rebecca Nurse, as she said, about two of the
							clock of the day” after Rebecca <pb n="289" id="vII289"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2296">
								<figDesc>Page 289.</figDesc>
							</figure> Nurse had been committed to jail, and while she was several
							miles distant, in Salem; and the said Nurse also struck said Ann Putnam
							with her spectral chain, leaving a mark, “being in a kind of a round
							ring, and three streaks across the ring: she had six blows with a chain
							in the space of half an hour; and she had one remarkable one, with six
							streaks across her arm.” Edward Putnam swears, “I saw the mark, both of
							bite and chains.” The Court, no doubt, were solemnly impressed by this
							amazing evidence; but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Ann Putnam
							was guilty of elaborate falsehood and a studied trick.</p>
						<p>In the trials at this session, one of the “afflicted children” cried out
							against the Rev. Samuel Willard, of the Old South Church, in Boston.
							“She was sent out of Court, and it was told about that she was mistaken
							in the person.” There was surely evidence enough against the honesty and
							credibility of the accusers to leave the judges without excuse, and
							justly meriting perpetual condemnation for not paying heed to it.</p>
						<p>The case of Rebecca Nurse proves that a verdict could not have been
							obtained against a person of her character charged with witchcraft in
							this county, had not the most extraordinary efforts been made by the
							prosecuting officer, aided by the whole influence of the Court and
							provincial authorities. The odium of the proceedings at the trials and
							at the executions cannot fairly be laid upon Salem, or the people of
							this vicinity.</p>
						<pb n="290" id="vII290"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2297">
								<figDesc>Page 290.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>But nothing can extenuate the infamy that must for ever rest upon the
							names of certain parties to the proceedings. Not to attempt here to
							measure the guilt of the accusing witnesses, it may be mentioned that it
							was the deliberate conviction of the family of Rebecca Nurse, that Mr.
							Parris, more than all other persons, was responsible for her execution;
							whether by his officious activity in driving on the prosecution, or in
							preventing her reprieve, cannot be known. Of the prominent part taken by
							Mr. Noyes in the cruel treatment of this woman, there is no room for
							doubt. The records of the First Church in Salem are darkened by the
							following entry: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“1692, July 3. — After sacrament, the elders propounded to the
								church, — and it was, by an unanimous vote, consented to, — that our
								sister Nurse, being a convicted witch by the Court, and condemned to
								die, should be excommunicated; which was accordingly done in the
								afternoon, she being present.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>The scene presented on this occasion must have been truly impressive at
							the time, as it is shocking to us in the retrospect. The action of the
							church, at the close of the morning service, of course became
							universally known; and the “great and spacious meeting” was thronged by
							a crowd that filled every nook and corner of its floor, galleries, and
							windows. The sheriff and his subordinates brought in the prisoner,
							manacled, and the chains clanking from her aged form. She was placed in
							the broad aisle. Mr. <pb n="291" id="vII291"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2298">
								<figDesc>Page 291.</figDesc>
							</figure> Higginson and Mr. Noyes — the elders, as the clergy were then
							called — were in the pulpit. The two ruling elders — who were lay
							officers — and the two deacons were in their proper seats, directly
							below and in front of the pulpit. Mr. Noyes pronounced the dread
							sentence, which, for such a crime, was then believed to be not merely an
							expulsion from the church on earth, but an exclusion from the church in
							heaven. It was meant to be understood as an eternal doom. As it had been
							proved, in his estimation, beyond a question, that she had given her
							soul to the Devil, he delivered her over to the great adversary of God
							and man.</p>
						<p>From the dismal cell, which, for but a few days longer, was to hold her
							body, he proclaimed the transferrence of her soul to —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
								<l part="N">“A dungeon horrible on all sides round,</l>
								<l part="N">As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames</l>
								<l part="N">No light, but rather darkness visible;</l>
								<l part="N">Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</l>
								<l part="N">And rest can never dwell; hope never comes</l>
								<l part="N">That comes to all; but torture without end,</l>
								<l part="N">As far removed from God, and light of heaven,</l>
								<l part="N">As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.”</l>
							</lg>
						</q>
						<p>Language and imagery, exhausting the resources of the divine genius of
							the greatest of poets, fail to give expression to what was felt to be
							the import of this fearful sentence. It sunk the recipient of it below
							the reach of human sympathy. She was regarded, by that blinded
							multitude, with a horror that cast out pity, and was full of hate. But
							in our view now, and, as we believe, in the view of God and angels then,
							she <pb n="292" id="vII292"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2299">
								<figDesc>Page 292.</figDesc>
							</figure> occupied an infinite height above her persecutors. Her mind
							was serenely fixed upon higher scenes, and filled with a peace which the
							world could not take away, or its cruel wrongs disturb. She went back to
							her prison walls, and then to the scaffold, with a pious and humble
							faith which has not failed to be recorded among men, as it has been
							rewarded where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at
							rest.</p>
						<p>Calef, as already quoted, gives the impression produced by her demeanor
							at her death. Hutchinson expresses in the following words the judgment
							of history and the sense of all coming times: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Mr. Noyes, the minister of Salem, a zealous prosecutor,
								excommunicated the poor old woman, and delivered her to Satan, to
								whom he supposed she had formally given herself up many years
								before; but her life and conversation had been such, that the
								remembrance thereof, in a short time after, wiped off all the
								reproach occasioned by the civil or ecclesiastical sentence against
								her.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>It is impossible to close the story of the lot assigned to this good
							woman by an inscrutable Providence, without again contemplating it in a
							condensed recapitulation. In her old age, experiencing a full share of
							all the delicate infirmities which the instincts of humanity require to
							be treated with careful and reverent tenderness, she was ruthlessly
							snatched from the bosom of a loving family reared by her pious fidelity
							in all Christian graces, from the side of the devoted companion of her
							long life, from a home that was endeared <pb n="293" id="vII293"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2300">
								<figDesc>Page 293.</figDesc>
							</figure> by every grateful association and comfort; immured in the most
							wretched and crowded jails; kept loaded with irons and bound with cords
							for months; insulted and maligned at the preliminary examinations;
							outraged in her person by rough and unfeeling handling and scrutiny; and
							in her rights, by the most flagrant and detestable judicial oppression,
							by which the benefit of a verdict, given in her favor, had been torn
							away; carried to the meeting-house to receive the sentence of
							excommunication in a manner devised to harrow her most sacred
							sentiments; and finally carted through the streets by a route every foot
							of which must have been distressing to her infirm and enfeebled frame;
							made to ascend a rough and rocky path to the place of execution, and
							there consigned to the hangman. Surely, there has seldom been a harder
							fate.</p>
						<p>Her body was probably thrown with the rest into a hole in the crevices of
							the rock, and covered hastily and thinly over by the executioners. It
							has been the constant tradition of the family, that, in some way, it was
							recovered; and the spot is pointed out in the burialplace belonging to
							the estate, where her ashes rest by the side of her husband, and in the
							midst of her children. It is certain, that, at least, one other body was
							thus exhumed, and taken to its own proper place of burial. From the
							known character of Francis Nurse and his sons and sons-in-law, we may be
							sure that what others could do they did not suffer to remain undone. It
							is left to the imagination to present the details of the sad and secret
							enterprise. In the <pb n="294" id="vII294"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2301">
								<figDesc>Page 294.</figDesc>
							</figure> darkness of midnight, they found and identified the body, and
							bore it tenderly in their arms along the silent roads and by-ways,
							across fields and over fences, to the old home, where it was received by
							the assembled family, mourned over, and cared for; and, during that or
							the ensuing night, deposited, with tears and prayers, in their own
							consecrated grounds. Her descendants of successive generations owned and
							reverently guarded the spot. They own and guard it to. The interesting
							reminiscences connected with the early history of the Nurse house have
							been alluded to. It has witnessed an extraordinary variety of the
							conditions of domestic vicissitude. Scenes rising before the mind in
							contemplative retrospection, while gazing upon it, present the extremest
							contrasts of human experience. On the evening of the 25th of October,
							1678, Mary and Elizabeth Nurse were married. Such an occurrence was
							undoubtedly the occasion of the highest joy and gladness in a happy
							household. The old mansion shone in light, and echoed voices of cheer.
							How altered its aspect! What darkness and silence brooded over and
							within it, while those same daughters waited, watched, and listened,
							through the solemn hours of that night of woe and horror, for the coming
							of their father, husbands, and brothers, bearing to the home, from which
							she had been so cruelly torn, the remains of their slaughtered
							mother!</p>
						<p>The subsequent history of the house presents a circumstance of singular
							interest in connection with <pb n="295" id="vII295"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2302">
								<figDesc>Page 295.</figDesc>
							</figure> our story. All the members of the three branches of the Putnam
							family, with the exception of Joseph, seem to have been carried away by
							the witchcraft delusion, in its early stages, and were more or less
							active in pushing on the prosecutions. We have seen how fierce was the
							maniac testimony of Mrs. Ann Putnam and her daughter against Rebecca
							Nurse. The lapse of time, by a Providence that wonderfully works its
							ends, has repaired the breaches made by folly and wrong. The descendants
							of the numerous family of Mrs. Ann Putnam have disappeared from the
							scene: none of them bearing the name are in the village. The descendants
							of Deacon Edward Putnam have also scattered in emigration to other
							places. Nathaniel and John, the heads of the other two branches of the
							family, although involved in the witchcraft delusion, each signed papers
							in favor of Rebecca Nurse; their descendants, as well as those of
							Joseph, are still numerous in the village, hold their old position of
							respectability and influence, and many of them occupy the lands of their
							ancestors. Stephen, the grandson of Nathaniel, married Miriam, the
							grand-daughter of John. Their son Phinehas, in 1784, bought the Nurse
							homestead from Benjamin Nurse, the great-grandson of Rebecca. Orin
							Putnam, the great-grandson of Phinehas, to whom the estate descends,
							married in 1836 the daughter of Allen Nurse, a direct descendant of
							Rebecca, and placed her at the head of her old ancestral homestead. The
							children of that marriage, with their father and grandfather, constitute
							the family <pb n="296" id="vII296"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2303">
								<figDesc>Page 296.</figDesc>
							</figure> that dwell in and own the venerable mansion. This singular
							restoration, suggesting such pleasing sentiments, adds another to the
							remarkable elements of interest belonging to the history of the
							Townsend-Bishop House.</p>
						<p>The descendants of Francis and Rebecca Nurse are numerous, and have
							honorably perpetuated the name. Among them may be mentioned the Rev.
							Peter Nurse, a graduate of Harvard College in 1802, for some years
							librarian of that institution, an excellent scholar, and long
							universally respected as a clergyman; and Amos Nurse, a graduate of the
							same college in 1812, — an eminent physician connected with the medical
							faculty of Bowdoin College, a man of distinguished talent and influence
							in public affairs, and senator in Congress from the State of Maine.</p>
						<p>The Court met again on the 5th of August, and tried George Burroughs;
							John Procter and Elizabeth, his wife; George Jacobs, Sr.; John Willard;
							and Martha Carrier. They were all condemned, and, with the exception of
							Elizabeth Procter, executed on the 19th of the same month.</p>
						<p>Hutchinson describes the trial of Burroughs. After speaking of the
							evidence of the “afflicted persons” and the confessing witches, he
							mentions other circumstances which were thought to corroborate it: “One
							was, that, being a little man, he had performed feats beyond the
							strength of a giant; viz., had held out a gun of seven feet barrel with
							one hand, and had carried a barrel full of cider from a canoe to the
							shore.” Burroughs <pb n="297" id="vII297"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2304">
								<figDesc>Page 297.</figDesc>
							</figure> said that an Indian present at the time did the same.
							Instantly, the accusers said it was “the black man, or the Devil, who,”
							they swore, “looks like an Indian.” Another piece of evidence was, that
							he went from one place to another, on a certain occasion, in a shorter
							time than was possible had not the Devil helped him. He said, in answer,
							that another man accompanied him. Their reply to this was, that it was
							the Devil, using the appearance of another man. So whatever he said was
							turned against him. Hutchinson says, “Upon the whole, he was confounded,
							and used many twistings and turnings, which, I think, we cannot wonder
							at.” This fair and judicious writer, like Brattle, appears in the
							foregoing remark to have adopted the common scandal, put in circulation
							by parties interested to disparage Mr. Burroughs. The papers in this
							case, that have come down to us, are more numerous than in reference to
							many others among the sufferers; and they do not bear such an
							impression. Mr. Burroughs was astounded at the monstrous folly and
							falsehood with which he was surrounded. He was a man without guile, and
							incapable of appreciating such wickedness. He tried, in simplicity and
							ingenuousness, to explain what was brought against him; and this,
							probably, was all the “twisting and turning” he exhibited.</p>
						<p>Hutchinson had the benefit of consulting all the papers belonging to this
							and other trials; but neither he nor Calef seems to have noticed one
							remarkable fact: many of the depositions, how many we cannot <pb n="298"
								id="vII298"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2305">
								<figDesc>Page 298.</figDesc>
							</figure> tell, were procured after the trials were over, and
							surreptitiously foisted in among the papers to bolster up the
							proceedings. We find, for instance, the following deposition: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Greenslitt,</hi> aged about forty years,
								being deposed, testifieth that, about the first breaking-out of this
								last Indian war, being at the house of Captain Joshua Scotto at
								Black Point, he saw Mr. George Burrows, who was lately executed at
								Salem, lift a gun of six-foot barrel or thereabouts, putting the
								forefinger of his right hand into the muzzle of said gun, and that
								he held it out at arms' end, only with that finger: and further this
								deponent testifieth, that, at the same time, he saw the said Burrows

								and some others that are dead. Sept. 15, '92.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Not only the date to this deposition, but its express language, proves
							that it could not have been used at the trial. There is another, to the
							same effect and of the same date, that is, nearly a month after
							Burroughs was thrown into his grave. There are others of the same kind.
							This stamps the management of the prosecutions, and of those concerned
							in the charge of the papers, with an irregularity of the grossest kind,
							which partakes strongly of the character of fraud and falsehood.</p>
						<p>When it was found that there was beginning to grow up a want of
							confidence in “spectre evidence” and the testimony of the afflicted
							children, those concerned <pb n="299" id="vII299"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2306">
								<figDesc>Page 299.</figDesc>
							</figure> in the prosecutions became alarmed lest a re-action of public
							sentiment might take place. The persons who had brought Mr. Burroughs to
							his death concluded that their best escape from public indignation was
							to accumulate evidence against him after he was in his grave,
							particularly on the point of his superhuman strength; and they got up
							these depositions, and caused them to be put among the papers on file.
							Great stress was laid, by those who were interested in damaging his
							character and suppressing sympathy in his fate, upon this particular
							proof of his having been in confederacy with the Devil. Increase Mather
							said, that, in his judgment, it was conclusive evidence that he “had the
							Devil to be his familiar,” and that, had he been on the jury, he could
							not, on this account, have concurred in a verdict of acquittal; and
							Cotton Mather, feeling the importance of making the most of Mr.
							Burroughs's extraordinary strength, gives way to his tendency to indulge
							in the marvellous, as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“God had been pleased so to leave this George Burroughs, that he had
								ensnared himself by several instances which he had formerly given of
								preternatural strength, and which were now produced against him. He
								was a very puny man, yet he had often done things beyond the
								strength of a giant. A gun of about seven-foot barrel, and so heavy
								that strong men could not steadily hold it out with both hands, —
								there were several testimonies given in by persons of credit and
								honor, that he made nothing of taking up such a gun behind the lock
								with but one hand, and holding it out, like a pistol, at arms' end.
								Yea, there were two <pb n="300" id="vII300"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2307">
									<figDesc>Page 300.</figDesc>
								</figure> testimonies, that George Burroughs, with only putting the
								forefinger of his right hand into the muzzle of a heavy gun, a
								fowling-piece of about six or seven foot barrel, did lift up the
								gun, and hold it out at arms' end, — a gun which the deponents
								thought strong men could not with both hands lift up, and hold at
								the butt end, as is usual.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>It is further observable, in reference to the foregoing deposition from
							Greenslitt, that it was given six days after the condemnation of his
							mother, Ann Pudeator, and a week before her execution. Cotton Mather
							says that he “was overpersuaded by others to be out of the way upon
							George Burroughs's trial,” six weeks before. He did not fail, however,
							to come to Salem to be with his mother at her trial and until her death,
							and being here was compelled to give his deposition. His mother's life
							was at the mercy of the prosecutors; and he was tempted, in the vain
							hope of conciliating that mercy, to gratify them by making the statement
							about Burroughs a month after his execution, and whom it could not then
							harm. What he said was probably no more than the truth. It has been
							found that the power of the human muscles can be cultivated to a
							surprising extent; and the feats ascribed to Burroughs, without making
							much allowance for a natural degree of exaggeration, have been fully
							equalled in our day.</p>
						<p>Calef gives the following account of his execution: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Mr. Burroughs was carried in a cart with the others, through the
								streets of Salem, to execution. When he was upon the ladder, he made
								a speech for the clearing of his <pb n="301" id="vII301"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2308">
									<figDesc>Page 301.</figDesc>
								</figure> innocency, with such solemn and serious expressions as
								were to the admiration of all present. His prayer (which he
								concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well worded, and
								uttered with such composedness and such (at least seeming) fervency
								of spirit, as was very affecting, and drew tears from many, so that
								it seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution.
								The accusers said the black man stood and dictated to him. As soon
								as he was turned off, Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a horse,
								addressed himself to the people, partly to declare that he (Mr.
								Burroughs) was no ordained minister, and partly to possess the
								people of his guilt, saying that the Devil often had been
								transformed into an angel of light; and this somewhat appeased the
								people, and the executions went on. When he was cut down, he was
								dragged by a halter to a hole, or grave, between the rocks, about
								two feet deep; his shirt and breeches being pulled off, and an old
								pair of trousers of one executed put on his lower parts: he was so
								put in, together with Willard and Carrier, that one of his hands,
								and his chin, and a foot of one of them, was left uncovered.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Cotton Mather, not satisfied with this display of animosity, at a moment
							when every human heart, however imbittered by prejudice, is hushed for
							the time in solemn silence, attempts, in an account afterwards given of
							Mr. Burroughs's trial, to blacken his character by an elaborate
							dressing-up of the absurd stories told by the accusers, and a perverse
							misrepresentation of the demeanor of the accused. He relates with
							apparent glee what was regarded as a wonderful achievement of adroitness
							on the part of Chief-justice Stoughton in trapping Mr. Burroughs, and
							putting the laugh upon him in Court.</p>

							<p>“It cost the Court a wonderful deal of trouble to hear the
								testimonies of the sufferers; for, when they were going to give in
								their depositions, they would for a long while be taken with fits,
								that made them quite uncapable of saying any thing. The chief judge
								asked the prisoner, who he thought hindered these witnesses from
								giving their testimonies; and he answered, he supposed it was the
								Devil. The honorable person then replied, `How comes the Devil so
								loath to have any testimony borne against you?' Which cast him into
								very great confusion.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>From what fell from him, at the preliminary examination, it is evident
							that it did not occur to him as a possibility that human nature could be
							capable of the guilt of such a wilful fabrication and imposture on the
							part of the “afflicted children.” He beheld their sufferings, and he
							knew his own innocence. He felt, whatever his theological creed might
							have been, that a Devil was required to explain the mystery. The
							apparent sufferings of the accusing witnesses convinced Court, jury, and
							all, of the guilt of the accused. The logic of the chief-justice was
							perfectly absurd. For, if the Devil caused the sufferings, he was an
							adverse party to the prisoner. This, however, overthrows the whole
							theory of the prosecution, which was that the prisoner and the Devil
							were in league with each other. But the judge, jury, and people, all
							equally blinded and stupefied by the delusion, did not see it; and they
							chuckled over the alleged confusion of the prisoner. All thoughtful
							persons will concur in Mr. Burroughs's opinion, that, if ever a
							diabolical power had possession <pb n="303" id="vII303"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2310">
								<figDesc>Page 303.</figDesc>
							</figure> of human beings, it was in the case of the wretched creatures
							who enacted the part of the accusing girls in the witchcraft
							proceedings. In his account of the trial, Mather makes statements which
							show that he was privy to the fact, that testimony, subsequently taken,
							was lodged with the evidence belonging to the case. The documents prove
							that it was done to an extent beyond what he acknowledges.</p>
						<p>Considering that none dared to show the least sympathy with the persons
							on trial, that they had none to counsel or stand by them, that the
							public passions were incensed against them as against no other persons
							ever charged with crime, — it being vastly more flagrant than any other
							crime, a rebellion against heaven and earth, God and man; a deliberate
							selling of the soul to the Arch-enemy of souls for the ruin of all other
							souls, — in view of all these things, it is truly astonishing, that, by
							the documents themselves, proceeding, as in almost all cases they do,
							from hostile and imbittered sources, we are compelled to the conviction,
							that, in their imprisonments, trials, and deaths, the victims of this
							savage delusion manifested — in most cases eminently, and in all
							substantially — the marks, not only of innocent, but of elevated and
							heroic minds. A review of what can be gleaned in reference to Mr.
							Burroughs at Casco Bay and Salem Village, and a considerate survey and
							scrutiny of all that has reached us from the day of his arrest to the
							moment of his death, have left a decided impression, that he was an
							able, intelligent, true-minded man; ingenuous, <pb n="304" id="vII304"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2311">
								<figDesc>Page 304.</figDesc>
							</figure> sincere, humble in his spirit; faithful and devoted as a
							minister; and active, generous, and disinterested as a citizen. His
							descendants, under his own name and the names of Newman, Fowle,
							Holbrook, Fox, Thomas, and others, have been numerous and respectable.
							The late Isaiah Thomas, LL.D., was one of them.</p>
						<p>From the account given of John Procter, in the First Part, it is apparent
							that he was a person of decided character, and, although impulsive and
							liable to be imprudent, of a manly spirit, honest, earnest, and bold in
							word and deed. He saw through the whole thing, and was convinced that it
							was the result of a conspiracy, deliberate and criminal, on the part of
							the accusers. He gave free utterance to his indignation at their
							conduct, and it cost him his life.</p>
						<p>A few days before his trial, he made his will. There is no reference in
							it to his particular situation. His signature to the document is
							accurately represented among the autographs given in this work. It was
							written while the manacles were on him. Notwithstanding the danger to
							which any one was exposed who expressed sympathy for convicted or
							accused persons, or doubt of their guilt, a large number had the
							manliness to try to save this worthy and honest citizen. John Wise, one
							of the ministers of Ipswich, heads the list of petitioners from that
							place. The document is in his handwriting. Thirty-one others joined in
							the act, many of them among the most respectable citizens of that town.
							Mr. Wise was a learned, able, and enlightened man. He had a free spirit,
							and was perhaps <pb n="305" id="vII305"/>

								the Devil can invent, under the permissions of sovereignty, though
								not for that sin forenamed, yet for our many transgressions. For we
								do at present suppose, that it may be a method within the severer

								sometimes may permit Sathan to personate, dissemble, and thereby
								abuse innocents and such as do, in the fear of God, defy the Devil
								and all his works. The great rage he is permitted to attempt holy
								Job with; the abuse he does the famous Samuel in disquieting his
								silent dust, by shadowing his venerable person in answer to the

								clearing of our neighbors' innocency; viz., that we never had the
								least knowledge of such a nefandous wickedness in our said

								we remember any such thoughts in us concerning them, or any action

								reputation as to any such evils. What God may have left them to, we
								cannot go into God's pavilion clothed with clouds of darkness round
								about; but, as to what we have ever seen or heard of them, upon our
								consciences we judge them innocent of the crime objected. His
								breeding hath been amongst us, and was of religious parents in our
								place, and, by reason of relations and properties within our town,
								hath had constant intercourse with us. We speak upon our personal
								acquaintance and observation; and so leave our neighbors, and this

							<figure id="Uphv2315">

							</figure> witnesses had denied, out of Court, what she had sworn to in

							sworn falsely, and tried to explain away her testimony in Court,
							acknowledging that what the girls said was “for sport. They must have
							some sport.” But neither the testimony in their favor from those who had

							the evidence against them had been impeached and exposed, could open the

						<p>After his conviction, he requested, in vain, time enough to prepare

							the courage of the writer in exposing them, and is a sensible and manly
							appeal and remonstrance. There is ground for supposing that the

							— is the first named, corroborates other evidence that he was beginning
							to entertain doubts about the propriety <pb n="309" id="vII309"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2316">
								<figDesc>Page 309.</figDesc>
							</figure> of the proceedings. Of the Rev. James Allen, much has been
							said in connection with the Townsend-Bishop farm. He had been a
							clergyman in England, and was silenced by the Act of Uniformity, in
							1662. He came to New England; and, after officiating as an assistant to
							the Rev. Mr. Davenport, in the First Church at Boston, for six years,
							was ordained as its preacher in 1668. He was of independent fortune, and
							subsequently took a leading part with those opposed to the party that
							had favored the witchcraft prosecutions. He must have known Rebecca
							Nurse quite intimately, and much of the influence used in her favor, and
							which almost saved her, may be attributed to him; there was a particular
							intimacy between him and Increase Mather, and together they held Cotton
							Mather somewhat in check, occasionally at least. The Rev. Joshua Moody
							had been settled in the ministry at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In the
							maintenance of the principles of religious liberty he suffered a long
							imprisonment, and was afterwards exiled by arbitrary power. He was then
							invited to the First Church in Boston, where he preached from 1684 to
							1693, when he returned to Portsmouth. He died in 1697. By his active
							exertions, Mr. and Mrs. English were enabled to escape from the jail at
							Boston. The Rev. Samuel Willard, pastor of the Old South Church in
							Boston, was one of the most revered and beloved ministers in the
							country. His publications were numerous, learned, and valuable;
							consisting of discourses, tracts, and volumes. His “Body of Divinity” is
							an elaborate and systematic <pb n="310" id="vII310"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2317">
								<figDesc>Page 310.</figDesc>
							</figure> work, comprising two hundred and fifty lectures on the
							Assembly's Catechism. That Procter was not in error in supposing Mr.
							Willard open to reason on the subject is demonstrated by the fact, that
							the “afflicted girls” were beginning to cry out against this eminent
							divine. The Rev. John Bailey was one of the ejected ministers who had
							here sought refuge from oppression in the mother-country. He was a
							distinguished person, associated with Mr. Allen and Mr. Moody in the
							ministry of the First Church at Boston. Cotton Mather made him the
							subject of the strongest eulogium in his “Magnalia.” Procter addressed
							his letter to these persons because he believed them to be superior in
							wisdom and candid in spirit. It cannot be doubted that the good men did
							what they could in his behalf, but in vain.</p>

							</figure> so much enraged and incensed against us by the delusion of the
							Devil, which we can term no other, by reason we know, in our own
							consciences, we are all innocent persons. Here are five persons who have
							lately confessed themselves to be witches, and do accuse some of us of
							being along with them at a sacrament, since we were committed into close
							prison, which we know to be lies. Two of the five are (Carrier's sons)
							young men, who would not confess any thing till they tied them neck and
							heels, till the blood was ready to come out of their noses; and it is
							credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of making them
							confess what they never did, by reason they said one had been a witch a
							month, and another five weeks, and that their mother made them so, who
							has been confined here this nine weeks. My son, William Procter, when he
							was examined, because he would not confess that he was guilty, when he
							was innocent, they tied him neck and heels till the blood gushed out at
							his nose, and would have kept him so twenty-four hours, if one, more
							merciful than the rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be
							unbound.</p>
						<p>“These actions are very like the Popish cruelties. They have already
							undone us in our estates, and that will not serve their turns without

							magistrates changed, and others in their room; begging also and
							beseeching you, that you would be pleased to be here, if not all, some
							of you, at our trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of saving the

						<p>The bitterness of the prosecutors against Procter was so vehement, that
							they not only arrested, and tried to destroy, his wife and all his
							family above the age of infancy, in Salem, but all her relatives in
							Lynn, many of whom were thrown into prison. The helpless children were
							left destitute, and the house swept of its provisions by the sheriff.
							Procter's wife gave birth to a child, about a fortnight after his
							execution. This indicates to what alone she owed her life.</p>
						<p>John Procter had spoken so boldly against the proceedings, and all who
							had part in them, that it was felt to be necessary to put him out of the
							way. He had denounced the entire company of the accusers, and their
							revenge demanded his sacrifice. They brought the whole power of their
							cunning and audacious arts to bear against him, and pursued him to the
							death with violence and rage. The manly and noble deportment exhibited
							in his dying hour seems to have made a deep impression on the minds of
							some, and gave an effectual blow to the delusion. The descendants of
							John Procter have always understood that his remains were recovered from
							the spot where the hangman deposited them, and placed in his own
							grounds, where they rest to-day.</p>
						<p>No account has come to us of the deportment of George Jacobs, Sr., at his
							execution. As he was remarkable in life for the firmness of his mind, so
							he probably was in death. He had made his will before the delusion
							arose. It is dated Jan. 29, 1692; and shows that he, like Procter, had a

							August, he caused another to be written, which, in its provisions,
							reflects light upon the state of mind produced by the condition in which
							he found himself. In his infirm old age, he had been condemned to die
							for a crime of which he knew himself innocent, and which there is some
							reason to believe he did not think any one capable of committing. He
							regarded the whole thing as a wicked conspiracy and absurd fabrication.
							He had to end his long life upon a scaffold in a week from that day. His
							house was desolated, and his property sequestered. His only son, charged
							with the same crime, had eluded the sheriff, — leaving his family, in
							the hurry of his flight, unprovided for — and was an exile in foreign
							lands. The crazy wife of that son was in prison and in chains, waiting
							trial on the same charge; her little children, including an unweaned
							infant, left in a deserted and destitute condition in the woods. The
							older children were scattered, he knew not where, while one of them had
							completed the bitterness of his lot by becoming a confessor, upon being
							arrested with her mother as a witch. This grand-daughter, Margaret,
							overwhelmed with fright and horror, bewildered by the statements of the
							accusers, and controlled probably by the arguments and arbitrary methods

						<p>“<hi rend="italics">The Humble Declaration of Margaret Jacobs unto the

							poor and humble declarant, being closely confined here in Salem jail for
							the crime of witchcraft, — which crime, thanks be to the Lord! I am
							altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment, —
							may it please the honored Court, I was cried out upon by some of the
							possessed persons as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my

							not confess, I should be put down into the dungeon, and would be hanged,
							but, if I would confess, I should have my life: the which did so
							affright me, with my own vile, wicked heart, to save my life, made me
							make the like confession I did, which confession, may it please the
							honored Court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night
							after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I
							could not sleep, for fear the Devil should carry me away for telling
							such horrid lies. I was, may it please the honored Court, sworn to my
							confession, as I understand <pb n="317" id="vII317"/>

							what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I trust, out of the
							abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false forswearing myself.
							What I said was altogether false against my grandfather and Mr.
							Burroughs, which I did to save my life, and to have my liberty: but the
							Lord, charging it to my conscience, made me in so much horror, that I
							could not contain myself before I had denied my confession, which I did,
							though I saw nothing but death before me; choosing rather death with a
							quiet conscience, than to live in such horror, which I could not suffer.
							Where, upon my denying my confession, I was committed to close prison,

							though to the wounding of my own soul; (the Lord pardon me for it!) but,
							oh! the terrors of a wounded conscience who can bear? But, blessed be

							my soul, would not suffer me to keep it any longer: but I was forced to
							confess the truth of all before the magistrates, who would not believe
							me; but it is their pleasure to put me in here, and God knows how soon I
							shall be put to death. Dear father, let me beg your prayers to the Lord
							on my behalf, and send us a joyful and happy meeting in heaven. My

						<p>A temporary illness led to the postponement of her trial; and, before the
							next sitting of the Court, the delusion had passed away.</p>
						<p>The “uncle D. A.,” referred to, was Daniel Andrew, their nearest
							neighbor, who had escaped at the <pb n="319" id="vII319"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2326">
								<figDesc>Page 319.</figDesc>
							</figure> same time with her father. She calls him “uncle.” He was, it
							is probable, a brother of John Andrew who had married Ann Jacobs, sister
							of her father. Words of relationship were then used with a wide
							sense.</p>
						<p>Margaret read the recantation of her confession before the Court, and
							was, as she says, forthwith ordered by them into a dungeon. She obtained
							permission to visit Mr. Burroughs the day before his execution,
							acknowledged that she had belied him, and implored his forgiveness. He
							freely forgave, and prayed with her and for her. It is probable, that,
							at the same time, she obtained an interview with her grandfather for the
							same purpose. At any rate, the old man heard of her heroic conduct, and
							forthwith crowded into the space between two paragraphs in his will, in
							small letters closely written (the jailer probably being the
							amanuensis), a clause giving a legacy of “ten pounds to be paid in
							silver” to his grand, Margaret Jacobs. There is the usual declaration,
							that it “was inserted before sealing and signing.” This will having been
							made after conviction and sentence to death, and having but two
							witnesses, one besides the jailer, was not allowed in Probate, but
							remains among the files of that Court. As a link in the foregoing story,
							it is an interesting relic. The legacy clause, although not operative,
							was no doubt of inexpressible value to the feelings of Margaret: and the
							circumstance seems to have touched the heart even of the General Court,
							nearly twenty years afterwards; for they took pains specifically to <pb
								n="320" id="vII320"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2327">
								<figDesc>Page 320.</figDesc>
							</figure> provide to have the same sum paid to Margaret, out of the
							Province treasury.</p>
						<p>She was not tried at the time appointed, in consequence, it is stated, of
							“an imposthume in the head,” and finally escaped the fate to which she
							chose to consign herself, rather than remain under a violated
							conscience. In judging of her, we cannot fail to make allowance for her
							“young and tender years,” and to sympathize in the sufferings through
							which she passed. In making confession, and in accusing others, she had
							done that which filled her heart with horror, in the retrospect, so long
							as she lived. In recanting it, and giving her body to the dungeon, and
							offering her life at the scaffold, she had secured the forgiveness of
							Mr. Burroughs and her aged grandfather, and deserves our forgiveness and
							admiration. Every human heart must rejoice that this young girl was
							saved. She lived to be a worthy matron and the founder of a numerous and
							respectable family.</p>

							preservation. An examination of the jawbones showed that he was a very
							old man at the time of his death, and had previously lost all his teeth.
							The length of some parts of the skeleton showed that he was a very tall
							man. These circumstances corresponded with the evidence, which was that
							he was tall of stature; so infirm as to walk with two staffs; with long,
							flowing white hair. The only article found, except the bones, was a
							metallic pin, which might have been used as a breastpin, or to hold
							together his aged locks. It is an observable fact, that he rests in his
							own ground still. He had lived for a great length of time on that spot;
							and it remains in his family and in his name to this day, having come

							</figure> shed much light upon our story. There is but one piece of
							evidence among the papers relating to his trial that deserves particular
							notice. It shows the horrid character of the charges made by the girls
							against prisoners at the bar, from their nature incapable of being
							refuted and which the prisoners knew to be false, but the Court, jury,
							and crowd implicitly believed. It also illustrates the completeness of
							the machinery got up by the “accusing girls” to give effect to their
							evidence. In addition to the evil gossip that could be scoured from all
							the country round, and to spectres of witches and ghosts of the dead,
							they brought into the scene angels and divine beings, and testified to
							what they were told by them. “The shining man,” or the white man, was

						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of Susanna Sheldon,</hi> aged

								of the date hereof (9th of May, 1692), I saw at Nathaniel Ingersoll
								house the apparitions of these four persons, — William Shaw's first
								wife, the Widow Cook, Goodman Jones and his child; and among these
								came the apparition of John Willard, to whom these four said, `You
								have murdered us.' These four having said thus to Willard, they
								turned as red as blood. And, turning about to look at me, they
								turned as pale as death. These four desired me to tell Mr. Hathorne.
								Willard, hearing them, pulled out a knife, saying, if I did, he
								would cut my throat.”</p>

						<p>The deponent goes on to say, that these several apparitions came before

							<p>“There did appear to me a shining man, who said I should go and tell
								what I had heard and seen to Mr. Hathorne. This Willard, being there

								place, this shining man told me, that if I did go to tell this to
								Mr. Hathorne, that I should be well, going and coming, but I should
								be afflicted there. Then said I to the shining man, `Hunt Willard
								away, and I would believe what he said, that he might not choke me.'
								With that the shining man held up his hand, and Willard vanished
								away. About two hours after, the same appeared to me again, and the
								said Willard with them; and I asked them where their wounds were,
								and they said there would come an angel from heaven, and would show
								them. And forthwith the angel came. I asked what the man's name was
								that appeared to me last, and the angel told his name was Southwick.
								And the angel lifted up his winding-sheet, and out of his left side
								he pulled a pitchfork tine, and put it in again, and likewise he
								opened all the winding-sheets, and showed all their wounds. And the

						<p>In the same deposition, this girl testifies that “she saw this Willard

							All we know of the manner of Willard's death is a passage from Brattle,

						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“11 September, Lord's Day. — Sister Martha Corey — taken into the
								church 27 April, 1690 — was, after examination upon suspicion of
								witchcraft, 27 March, 1692, committed to prison for that fact, and
								was condemned to the <pb n="325" id="vII325"/>

								public, by a general consent, voted to be excommunicated out of the
								church, and Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam and the two deacons chosen
								to signify to her, with the pastor, the mind of the church herein.
								Accordingly, this 14 September, 1692, the three aforesaid brethren
								went with the pastor to her in Salem Prison; whom we found very
								obdurate, justifying herself, and condemning all that had done any
								thing to her just discovery or condemnation. Whereupon, after a
								little discourse (for her imperiousness would not suffer much), and
								after prayer, — which she was willing to decline, — the dreadful
								sentence of excommunication was pronounced against her.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Calef informs us, that “Martha Corey, protesting her innocency, concluded
							her life with an eminent prayer upon the ladder.”</p>
						<p>Nothing has reached us particularly relating to the manner of death of
							Alice or Mary Parker, Ann Pudeator, Margaret Scott, or Wilmot Reed. They
							all asserted their innocence; and their deportment gave no ground for
							any unfavorable comment by their persecutors, who were on the watch to
							turn every act, word, or look of the sufferers to their disparagement.
							Wilmot Reed probably adhered to the unresisting demeanor which marked
							her examination. It was all a mystery to her; and to every question she
							answered, “I know nothing about it.” Of Mary Easty it is grateful to
							have some account. Her own declarations in vindication of her innocence

						<p>The parting interview of this admirable woman with her husband, children,
							and friends, as she was about proceeding to the place of execution, is
							said to have been a most solemn, affecting, and truly sublime scene.
							Calef says that her farewell communications, on this occasion, were
							reported, by persons who listened to them, to have been “as serious,
							religious, distinct, and affectionate as could well be expressed,
							drawing tears from the eyes of almost all present.”</p>
						<p>Ann Pudeator had been formerly the wife of a person named Greenslitt, who
							left her with five children. Her subsequent husband, Jacob Pudeator,
							died in 1682, and by will gave her his whole estate, after the payment
							of legacies, of five pounds each, to her Greenslitt children, who appear
							to have been living in 1692 at Casco Bay. These provisions, as well as
							the expressions used by Pudeator, indicate that he regarded her with
							affection and esteem. The following document is all that we know else of
							her character particularly, except that she was a kind neighbor, and
							ever prompt in offices of charity and sympathy.</p>

						<p>Abigail, the wife of Francis Faulkner, and daughter of the Rev. Francis
							Dane, of Andover, who was among those sentenced on the 17th of
							September, had been examined, on the 11th of August, by Hathorne,
							Corwin, and Captain John Higginson, sitting as magistrates. Upon the
							prisoner's being brought in, the afflicted fell down, and went into
							fits, as usual. The magistrates asked the prisoner what she had to say.
							She replied, “I know nothing of it.” The girls then renewed their
							performances, declaring that her shape was at that moment torturing
							them. The magistrates asked her if she did not see their sufferings. She
							answered, “Yes; but it is the Devil does it in my shape.” Ann Putnam
							said that her spectre had afflicted her a few days before, pulling her
							off her horse. <pb n="331" id="vII331"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2340">
								<figDesc>Page 331.</figDesc>
							</figure> Upon the touch of her person, the sufferings of the afflicted
							would cease for a time. The prisoner held a handkerchief in her hand.
							The girls would screech out, declaring that, as she pressed the
							handkerchief, they were dreadfully squeezed. She threw the handkerchief
							on the table; and they said, “There are the shapes of Daniel Eames and
							Captain Floyd [two persons then in prison on the charge of witchcraft]
							sitting on her handkerchief.” Mary Warren enacted the part of being
							dragged against her will under the table by an invisible hand, from
							whose grasp she was at once released, upon the prisoner's being made to
							touch her. Notwithstanding all this, she protested her innocence, and
							was remanded to jail. On the 30th, she was brought out again. In the
							mean while, six had been executed. The usual means were employed to
							break her down; but all that was gained was, that she owned she had
							expressed her indignation at the conduct of the afflicted, and was much
							excited against them “for bringing her kindred out, and she did wish
							them ill: and, her spirit being raised, she did pinch her hands
							together, and she knew not but that the Devil might take that advantage;
							but it was the Devil, and not she, that afflicted them.” This was the
							only concession she would make; and they were puzzled to determine
							whether it was a confession, or not, — it having rather the appearance
							of clearing herself from all implication with the Devil, and leaving him
							on their hands — at any rate, they concluded to regard it in the latter
							sense; and she was <pb n="332" id="vII332"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2341">
								<figDesc>Page 332.</figDesc>
							</figure> duly convicted, and sentenced to death. Sir William Phips
							ordered a reprieve; and, after she had been thirteen weeks in prison, he
							directed her to be discharged on the ground of insufficient evidence.
							This, I think, is the only instance of a special pardon granted during
							the proceedings.</p>
						<p>Samuel Wardwell, like most of the accused belonging to Andover, had
							originally joined the crowd of the confessors; but he was too much of a
							man to remain in that company. He took back his confession, and met his
							death. While he was speaking to the people, at the gallows, declaring
							his innocency, a puff of tobacco-smoke from the pipe of the executioner,
							as Calef informs us, “coming in his face, interrupted his discourse:
							those accusers said that the Devil did hinder him with smoke.” The
							wicked creatures followed their victims to the last with their malignant
							outrages. The cart that carried the prisoners, on this occasion, to the
							hill, “was for some time at a set: the afflicted and others said that
							the Devil hindered it,” &amp;c.</p>
						<p>The route by which they were conveyed from the jail, which was at the
							north corner of Federal and St. Peter's Streets, to the gallows, must
							have been a cruelly painful and fatiguing one, particularly to infirm
							and delicate persons, as many of them were. It was through St. Peter's,
							up the whole length of Essex, and thence probably along Boston Street,
							far towards Aborn Street; for the hill could only be ascended from that
							direction. It must have been a rough and jolting <pb n="333" id="vII333"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2342">
								<figDesc>Page 333.</figDesc>
							</figure> operation; and it is not strange that the cart got “set.” It
							seems that the prisoners were carried in a single cart. It was a large
							one, provided probably for the occasion; and it is not unlikely that the
							reason why some who had been condemned were not executed, was that the
							cart could not hold them all at once. They were executed, one in June,
							five in July, five in August, and eight in September, with the
							intention, no doubt, by taking them in instalments, to extend the acts
							of the tragedy, from month to month, indefinitely.</p>
						<p>It was necessary for the safety of the accusers and prosecutors to
							prevent a revulsion of the public mind, or even the least diminution of
							the popular violence against the supposed witches. As they all protested
							their innocence to the moment of death, and exhibited a remarkably
							Christian deportment throughout the dreadful scenes they were called to
							encounter from their arrest to their execution, there was reason to
							apprehend that the people would gradually be led to feel a sympathy for
							them, if not to entertain doubts of their guilt. To prevent this, and
							remove any impressions favorable to them that might be made by the
							conduct and declarations of the convicts, the prosecutors were on the
							alert. After the prisoners had been swung off, on the 22d of September,
							“turning him to the bodies, Mr. Noyes said, `What a sad thing it is to
							see eight firebrands of hell hanging there!”' It was the last time his
							eyes were regaled by such a sight. There were no more executions on
							Witch Hill.</p>

						</p>
						<p>Three days before, a life had been taken by the officers of the law in a
							manner so extraordinary, and marked by features so shocking, that they
							find no parallel in the annals of America, and will continue to arrest
							for ever the notice of mankind. The history and character of old Giles
							Corey have been given in preceding parts of this work. The only papers
							relating to him, on file as having been sworn to before the Grand Jury,
							are a few brief depositions. If he had been put on trial, we might have
							had more. Elizabeth Woodwell testifies, that “she saw Giles Corey at
							meeting at Salem on a lecture-day, since he has been in prison. He or
							his apparition came in, and sat in the middlemost seat of the men's
							seats, by the post. This was the lecture-day before Bridget Bishop was
							hanged. And I saw him come out with the rest of the people.” Mary
							Walcot, of course, swore to the same. And Mary Warren swore that Corey
							was hostile to her and afflicted her, because he thought she “caused her
							master (John Procter) to ask more for a piece of meadow than he (Corey)
							was willing to give.” She also charged him with “afflicting of her” by
							his spectre while he was in prison, and “described him in all his
							garments, both fo hat, coat, and the color of them, — with a cord about
							his waist and a white cap on his head, and in chains.” There is reason
							to believe, that, while in prison, he experienced great distress of
							mind. Although he had been a rough character in earlier life, and given
							occasion to much scandal by his disregard of public opinion, he always
							exhibited symptoms <pb n="335" id="vII335"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2344">
								<figDesc>Page 335.</figDesc>
							</figure> of a generous and sensitive nature. His foolish conduct in
							becoming so passionately engaged in the witchcraft proceedings, at their
							earliest stage, as to be incensed against his wife because she did not
							approve of or believe in them, and which led him to utter sentiments and
							expressions that had been used against her; and so far yielding to the
							accusers as to allow them to get from him the deposition, which, while
							it failed to satisfy their demands, it was shameful for him to have been
							persuaded to give, — all these things, which after his own apprehension
							and imprisonment he had leisure to ponder upon, preyed on his mind. He
							saw the awful character of the delusion to which he had lent himself;
							that it had brought his prayerful and excellent wife to the sentence of
							death, which had already been executed upon many other devout and worthy
							persons. He knew that he was innocent of the crime of witchcraft, and
							was now satisfied that all others were. Besides his own unfriendly
							course towards his wife, two of his four sons-in-law had turned against
							her. One (Crosby) had testified, and another (Parker) had allowed his
							name to be used, as an adverse witness. In view of all this, Corey made
							up his mind, determined on his course, and stood to that determination.
							He resolved to expiate his own folly by a fate that would satisfy the
							demands of the sternest criticism upon his conduct; proclaim his
							abhorrence of the prosecutions; and attest the strength of his feelings
							towards those of his children who had been false, and those who had been
							true, to his wife. <pb n="336" id="vII336"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2345">
								<figDesc>Page 336.</figDesc>
							</figure> He caused to be drawn up what has been called a will, although
							it is in reality a deed, and was duly recorded as such. Its phraseology
							is very strongly guarded, and made to give it clear, full, and certain
							effect. It begins thus: “Know ye, &amp;c., that I, Giles Corey, lying
							under great trouble and affliction, through which I am very weak in
							body, but in perfect memory, — knowing not how soon I may depart this
							life; in consideration of which, and for the fatherly love and affection
							which I have and do bear unto my beloved son-in-law, William Cleeves, of
							the town of Beverly, and to my son, John Moulton, of the town of Salem,
							as also for divers other good causes and considerations me at the
							present especially moving;” and proceeds to convey and confirm all his
							property — “lands, meadow, housing, cattle, stock, movables and
							immovables, money, apparel,... and all other the aforesaid premises,
							with their appurtenances” — to the said Cleeves and Moulton “for ever,
							freely and quietly, without any manner of challenge, claim, or demand of
							me the said Giles Corey, or of any other person or persons whatsoever
							for me in my name, or by my cause, means, or procurement;” and, in the
							use of all the language applicable to that end, he warrants and binds
							himself to defend the aforesaid conveyance and grant to Cleeves and
							Moulton, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns for ever.
							The document was properly signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence
							of competent witnesses, whose several signatures are indorsed to that
							effect. It was duly acknowledged <pb n="337" id="vII337"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2346">
								<figDesc>Page 337.</figDesc>
							</figure> before “Thomas Wade, Justice of the Peace in Essex,” and
							recorded forthwith. This transaction took place in the jail at
							Ipswich.</p>
						<p>His whole property being thus securely conveyed to his faithful
							sons-in-law, and placed beyond the reach of his own weakness or change
							of purpose, Corey resolved on a course that would surely try to the
							utmost the power of human endurance and firmness. He knew, that, if
							brought to trial, his death was certain. He did not know but that
							conviction and execution, through the attainder connected with it, might
							invalidate all attempts of his to convey his property. But it was
							certain, that, if he should not be brought to trial and conviction, his
							deed would stand, and nothing could break it, or defeat its effect. He
							accordingly made up his mind not to be tried. When called into court to
							answer to the indictment found by the Grand Jury, he did not plead
							“Guilty,” or “Not guilty,” but stood mute. How often he was called
							forth, we are not informed; but nothing could shake him. No power on
							earth could unseal his lips.</p>
						<p>He knew that he could have no trial that would deserve the name. To have
							pleaded “Not guilty” would have made him, by his own act, a party to the
							proceeding, and have been, by implication, an assent to putting his case
							to the decision of a blind, maddened, and utterly perverted tribunal. He
							would not, by any act or utterance of his, leave his case with “the
							country” represented by a jury that embodied the passions of the deluded
							and infatuated multitude <pb n="338" id="vII338"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2347">
								<figDesc>Page 338.</figDesc>
							</figure> around him. He knew that the gates of justice were closed, and
							that truth had fled from the scene. He would have no part nor lot in the
							matter; refused to recognize the court, made no response to its
							questions, and was dumb in its presence. He stands alone in the resolute
							defiance of his attitude. He knew the penalty of suffering and agony he
							would have to pay; but he freely and fearlessly encountered it. All that
							was needed to carry his point was an unconquerable firmness, and he had
							it. He rendered it impossible to bring him to trial; and thereby, in
							spite of the power and wrath of the whole country and its authorities,
							retained his right to dispose of his property; and bore his testimony
							against the wickedness and folly of the hour in tones that reached the
							whole world, and will resound through all the ages.</p>
						<p>When Corey took this ground, the Court found itself in a position of no
							little difficulty, and was probably at a loss what to do. No information
							has come to us of the details of the proceedings. If the usages in
							England on such occasions were adopted, the prisoner was three times
							brought before the Court, and called to plead; the consequences of
							persisting in standing mute being solemnly announced to him at each
							time. If he remained obdurate, the sentence of <foreign lang="unknown"
								rend="italics">peine forte et dure</foreign> was passed upon him;
							and, remanded to prison, he was put into a low and dark apartment. He
							would there be laid on his back on the bare floor, naked for the most
							part. A weight of iron would be placed upon him, not quite enough to
							crush him. He <pb n="339" id="vII339"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2348">
								<figDesc>Page 339.</figDesc>
							</figure> would have no sustenance, save only, on the first day, three
							morsels of the worst bread; and, on the second day, three draughts of
							standing water that should be nearest to the prison door: and, in this
							situation, such would be alternately his daily diet till he died, or
							till he answered. The object of this terrible punishment was to induce
							the prisoner to plead to the indictment; upon doing which, he would be
							brought to trial in the ordinary way. The motive that led prisoners to
							stand mute in England is stated to have been, most generally, to save
							their property from confiscation. The practice of putting weights upon
							them, and gradually increasing them, was to force them, by the slowly
							increasing torture, to yield.</p>
						<p>How far the English practice was imitated in the case of Corey will
							remain for ever among the dread secrets of his prison-house. The
							tradition is, that the last act in the tragedy was in an open field near
							the jail, somewhere between Howard-street Burial Ground and Brown
							Street. It is said that Corey urged the executioners to increase the
							weight which was crushing him, that he told them it was of no use to
							expect him to yield, that there could be but one way of ending the
							matter, and that they might as well pile on the rocks. Calef says, that,
							as his body yielded to the pressure, his tongue protruded from his
							mouth, and an official forced it back with his cane. Some persons now
							living remember a popular superstition, lingering in the minds of some
							of the more ignorant class, that Corey's ghost haunted the grounds where
							this barbarous <pb n="340" id="vII340"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2349">
								<figDesc>Page 340.</figDesc>
							</figure> deed was done; and that boys, as they sported in the vicinity,
							were in the habit of singing a ditty beginning thus: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
								<l part="N">“`More weight! more weight!'</l>
								<l part="N">Giles Corey he cried.”</l>
							</lg>
						</q>
						<p>For a person of more than eighty-one years of age, this must be allowed
							to have been a marvellous exhibition of prowess; illustrating, as
							strongly as any thing in human history, the power of a resolute will
							over the utmost pain and agony of body, and demonstrating that Giles
							Corey was a man of heroic nerve, and of a spirit that could not be
							subdued.</p>
						<p>It produced a deep effect, as it was feared that it would. The bearing of
							all the sufferers at all the stages of the proceedings, and at their
							execution, had told in their favor; but the course of Giles Corey
							profoundly affected the public mind. This must have been noticed by the
							managers of the prosecutions; and they felt that some extraordinary
							expedient was necessary to renew, and render more intense than ever, the
							general infatuation. From the very beginning, there had been great skill
							and adroitness in arranging the order of incidents, and supplying the
							requisite excitements at the right moments and the right points. Some
							persons — it can only be conjectured who — had, all along, been behind
							the scenes, giving direction and materials to the open actors. This
							unseen power was in the village; and the movements it devised generally
							proceeded from Thomas Putnam's house, or the parsonage. It was on hand
							to meet the contingency <pb n="341" id="vII341"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2350">
								<figDesc>Page 341.</figDesc>
							</figure> created by Corey's having actually carried out to the last his
							resolution to meet a form of death that would, if any thing could, cause
							a re-action in the public mind; and the following <unclear/> was
							contrived to turn the manner of his death into the means of more than
							ever blinding and infatuating the people. It was the last and one of the
							most artful strokes of policy by the prosecutors. On the day after the
							death of Corey, and two days before the execution of his wife, Mary
							Easty, and the six others, Judge Sewall, then in Salem, received a
							letter from Thomas Putnam to this effect: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Last night, my daughter Ann was grievously tormented by witches,
								threatening that she should be pressed to death before Giles Corey;
								but, through the goodness of a gracious God, she had at last a
								little respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man
								in a winding-sheet, who told her that Giles Corey had murdered him
								by pressing him to death with his feet; but that the Devil there
								appeared unto him, and covenanted with him, and promised him that he
								should not be hanged. The apparition said God hardened his heart,
								that he should not hearken to the advice of the Court, and so die an
								easy death; because, as it said, it must be done to him as he has
								done to me. The apparition also said that Giles Corey was carried to
								the Court for this, and that the jury had found the murder; and that
								her father knew the man, and the thing was done before she was
								born.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Cotton Mather represented this vision, made to Ann Putnam, as proof
							positive of a divine communication to her, because, as he says, she
							could not have received <pb n="342" id="vII342"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2351">
								<figDesc>Page 342.</figDesc>
							</figure> her information from a human source, as everybody had
							forgotten the affair long ago; and that she never could have heard of
							it, happening, as it did, before she was born. Bringing up this old
							matter to meet the effect produced by Corey's death was indeed a skilful
							move; and it answered its purpose probably to a considerable extent. The
							man whom Corey was thus charged with having murdered seventeen years
							before died in a manner causing some gossip at the time; and a coroner's
							jury found that he had been “bruised to death, having clodders of blood
							about the heart.” Bringing the affair back to the public mind, with the
							story of Ann Putnam's vision, was well calculated to meet and check any
							sympathy that might threaten to arise in favor of Corey. But the trick,
							however ingenious, will not stand the test of scrutiny. Mather's
							statement that everybody had forgotten the transaction, and that Ann
							could only have known of it supernaturally, is wholly untenable; for it
							was precisely one of those things that are never forgotten in a country
							village: it had always been kept alive as a part of the gossip of the
							neighborhood in connection with Corey; and her own father, as is
							unwittingly acknowledged, knew the man, and all about it. Of course, the
							girl had heard of it from him and others. The industry that had
							ransacked the traditions and collected the scandal of the whole country,
							far and near, for stories that were brought in evidence against all the
							prisoners, had not failed to pick up this choice bit against Corey. The
							only reason why it had not <pb n="343" id="vII343"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2352">
								<figDesc>Page 343.</figDesc>
							</figure> before been brought out was because he had not been on trial.
							The man who died with “clodders of blood about his heart,” seventeen
							years before, was an unfortunate and worthless person, who had incurred
							punishment for his misconduct while a servant on Corey's farm, and
							afterwards at the hands of his own family: and he does not appear to
							have mended his morals upon passing into the spiritual world; for the
							statement of his ghost to Ann Putnam, that the jury had found Corey
							guilty of murder, and that the Court was hindered by some enchantment
							from proceeding against him, is disproved by the record which is — as
							has been mentioned in the First Part, vol. i. p. 185 — that the man was
							carried back to his house by Corey's wife, and died there some time
							after; and the Court did no more than fine Corey for the punishment he
							had inflicted upon him while in his service, and which the evidence
							showed was repeated by his parents after his return to his own
							family.</p>
						<p>Thomas Putnam's letter and Ann's vision were the last things of the kind
							that occurred. The delusion was approaching its close, and the people
							were beginning to be restored to their senses.</p>
						<p>When it became known that Corey's resolution was likely to hold out, and
							that no torments or cruelties of any kind could subdue his firm and
							invincible spirit, Mr. Noyes hurried a special meeting of his church on
							a week-day, and had the satisfaction of dealing the same awful doom upon
							him as upon Rebecca Nurse. The entry in the record of the First Church
							is as follows: —</p>
						<pb n="344" id="vII344"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2353">
								<figDesc>Page 344.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Sept. 18, G. Corey was excommunicated: the cause of it was, that he
								being accused and indicted for the sin of witchcraft, he refused to
								plead, and so incurred the sentence and penalty of <hi
									rend="italics">pain fort dure;</hi> being undoubtedly either
								guilty of the sin of witchcraft, or of throwing himself upon sudden
								and certain death, if he were otherwise innocent.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>This attempt to introduce a form of argument into a church act of
							excommunication is a slight but significant symptom of its having become
							felt that the breath of reason had begun to raise a ripple upon the
							surface of the public mind. It increased slowly but steadily to a gale
							that beat with severity upon Mr. Noyes and all his fellow-persecutors to
							their dying day.</p>
						<p>After the executions, on the 22d of September, the Court adjourned to
							meet some weeks subsequently; and it was, no doubt, their expectation to
							continue from month to month to hold sessions, and supply, each time,
							new cart-loads of victims to the hangman. But a sudden collapse took
							place in the machinery, and they met no more. The executive authority
							intervened, and their functions ceased. The curtain fell unexpectedly,
							and the tragedy ended. It is not known precisely what caused this sudden
							change. It is probable, that a revolution had been going on some time in
							the public mind, which was kept for a while from notice, but at last
							became too apparent and too serious to be disregarded. It has generally
							been attributed to the fact, that the girls became over-confident, and
							struck too high. They had ventured, as we have seen, to cry <pb n="345"
								id="vII345"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2354">
								<figDesc>Page 345.</figDesc>
							</figure> out against the Rev. Samuel Willard, but were rebuked and
							silenced by the Court. Whoever began to waver in his confidence of the
							correctness of the proceedings was in danger of being attacked by them;
							and, as a general thing, when a person was “cried out upon,” it may be
							taken as proof that he had spoken against them. Increase Mather, the
							president of Harvard College, called by Eliot “the father of New
							clergy,” was understood not to go so far as his son Cotton in sustaining
							the proceedings; and a member of his family was accused. The wife of Sir
							William Phips sympathized with those who suffered prosecution, and is
							said to have written an order for the release of a prisoner from jail.
							She was cried out upon. It may have been noticed, that, though Jonathan
							Corwin sat with Hathorne as an examining magistrate and assistant, and
							signed the commitments of the prisoners, he never took an active part,
							but was a silent and passive agent in the scene. He was subsequently
							raised to the bench; but there is reason to believe that his mind was
							not clear as to the correctness of the proceedings. This probably became
							known to the accusing girls; for they cried out repeatedly against his
							wife's <unclear/> her, a respectable and venerable lady in Boston. The
							accusers, in aiming at such characters, overestimated their power; and
							the tide began to turn against them. But what finally broke the spell by
							which they had hold the minds of the whole colony in bondage was their
							accusation, in October, of Mrs. Hale, the wife of the <pb n="346"
								id="vII346"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2355">
								<figDesc>Page 346.</figDesc>
							</figure> minister of the First Church in Beverly. Her genuine and
							distinguished virtues had won for her a reputation, and secured in the
							hearts of the people a confidence, which superstition itself could not
							sully nor shake. Mr. Hale had been active in all the previous
							proceedings; but he knew the innocence and piety of his wife, and he
							stood forth between her and the storm he had helped to raise: although
							he had driven it on while others were its victims, he turned and
							resisted it when it burst in upon his own dwelling. The whole community
							became convinced that the accusers in crying out upon Mrs. Hale, had
							perjured themselves, and from that moment their power was destroyed; the
							awful delusion was dispelled, and a close put to one of the most
							tremendous tragedies in the history of real life. The wildest storm,
							perhaps, that ever raged in the moral world, became a calm; the tide
							that had threatened to overwhelm every thing in its fury, sunk back to
							its peaceful bed. There are few, if any, other instances in history, of
							a revolution of opinion and feeling so sudden, so rapid, and so
							complete. The images and visions that had possessed the bewildered
							imaginations of the people flitted away, and left them standing in the
							sunshine of reason and their senses; and they could have exclaimed, as
							they witnessed them passing off, in the language of the great master of
							the drama and of human nature, but that their rigid Puritan principles
							would not, it is presumed, have permitted them, even in that moment of
							rescue and deliverance, to quote Shakspeare, —</p>

						<p>Sir William Phips well knew that the public sentiment demanded a stop to
							be put to the prosecutions. Besides that many of the people had lost all
							faith in the grounds on which they had been conducted, an influence from
							the higher orders of society began to make itself felt. Hutchinson says,
							“Although many such had suffered, yet there remained in prison a number
							of women of as reputable families as any in the towns where they lived,
							and several persons, of still superior rank, were hinted at by the
							pretended bewitched, or by the confessing witches. Some had been
							publicly named. Dudley Bradstreet, a justice of peace, who had been
							appointed one of President Dudley's council, and who was son to the
							worthy old governor, then living, found it necessary to abscond. Having
							been remiss in prosecuting, he had been charged by some of the afflicted
							as a confederate. His brother, John Bradstreet, was forced to fly
							also.”</p>
						<p>The termination of the proceedings was probably effectually secured by
							the spirited course of certain parties in Andover, who, at the first
							moment of its appearing that the public sentiment was changing,
							commenced actions for slander against the accusers.</p>
						<p>The result of the whole matter was, that, while some of the judges,
							magistrates, and ministers persisted in their fanatical zeal, the great
							body of the people, high and low, were rescued from the delusion.</p>

						<p>While, in the course of our story, we have witnessed some shocking
							instances of the violation of the most sacred affections and obligations
							of life, in husbands and wives, parents and children, testifying against
							each other, and exerting themselves for mutual destruction, we must not
							overlook the many instances in which filial, parental, and fraternal
							fidelity and love have shone conspicuously. It was dangerous to befriend
							an accused person. Procter stood by his wife to protect her, and it cost
							him his life. Children protested against the treatment of their parents,
							and they were all thrown into prison. Daniel Andrew, a citizen of high
							standing, who had been deputy to the General Court, asserted, in the
							boldest language, his belief of Rebecca Nurse's innocence; and he had to
							fly the country to save his life. Many devoted sons and daughters clung
							to their parents, visited them in prison in defiance of a bloodthirsty
							mob; kept by their side on the way to execution; expressed their love,
							sympathy, and reverence to the last; and, by brave and perilous
							enterprise, got possession of their remains, and bore them back under
							the cover of midnight to their own thresholds, and to graves kept
							consecrated by their prayers and tears. One noble young man is said to
							have effected his mother's escape from the jail, and secreted her in the
							woods until after the delusion had passed away, provided food and
							clothing for her, erected a wigwam for her shelter, and surrounded her
							with every comfort her situation would admit of. The poor creature must,
								<pb n="349" id="vII349"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2358">
								<figDesc>Page 349.</figDesc>
							</figure> however, have endured a great amount of suffering; for one of
							her larger limbs was fractured in the all but desperate attempt to
							rescue her from the prison.</p>
						<p>The Special Court being no longer suffered to meet, a permanent and
							regular tribunal, called the Superior Court of Judicature, was
							established, consisting of the Deputy-governor, William Stoughton,
							Chief-justice; and Thomas Danforth, John Richards, Wait Winthrop, and
							Samuel Sewall, associate justices. They held a Court at Salem, in
							January, 1693. Hutchinson says that, on this occasion, the Grand Jury
							found about fifty indictments. The following persons were brought to
							trial: Rebecca Jacobs, Margaret Jacobs, Sarah Buckley, Job Tookey,
							Hannah Tyler, Candy, Mary Marston, Elizabeth Johnson, Abigail Barker,
							Mary Tyler, Sarah Hawkes, Mary Wardwell, Mary Bridges, Hannah Post,
							Sarah Bridges, Mary Osgood, Mary Lacy, Jr., Sarah Wardwell, Elizabeth
							Johnson, Jr., and Mary Post. The three last were condemned, but not
							executed: all the rest were acquitted. Considering that the “spectral
							evidence” was wholly thrown out at these trials, the facts that the
							grand jury, under the advice of the Court, brought in so many
							indictments, and that three were actually convicted, are as
							discreditable to the regular Court as the convictions at the Special
							Court are to that body. It has been said that the Special Court had not
							an adequate representation of lawyers in its composition; and the
							results of its proceedings have been ascribed to that circumstance. It
							has been <pb n="350" id="vII350"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2359">
								<figDesc>Page 350.</figDesc>
							</figure> held up disparagingly in comparison with the regular Court
							that succeeded it. But, in fact, the regular Court consisted of persons
							all of whom sat in the Special Court, with the exception of Danforth.
							But his proceedings in originating the arrests for witchcraft in the
							fall of 1691, and his action when presiding at the preliminary
							examination of John Procter, Elizabeth Procter, and Sarah Cloyse, at
							Salem, April 11, 1692, show that, so far as the permission of gross
							irregularities and the admission of absurd kinds of testimony are
							concerned, the regular Court gained nothing by his sitting with it,
							unless his views had been thoroughly changed in the mean time. The truth
							is, that the judges, magistrates, and legislature were as much to blame,
							in this whole business, as the ministers, and much more slow to come to
							their senses, and make amends for their wrong-doing.</p>
						<p>All the facts known to us, and all the statements that have come down to
							us, require us to believe, that none who confessed, and stood to their
							confession, were brought to trial. All who were condemned either
							maintained their innocence from the first, or, if persuaded or overcome
							into a confession, voluntarily took it back and disowned it before
							trial. If this be so, then the name of every person condemned ought to
							be held in lasting honor, as preferring to die rather than lie, or stand
							to a lie. It required great strength of mind to take back a confession;
							relinquish life and liberty; go down into a dungeon, loaded with irons;
							and from thence to ascend the gallows. It relieves <pb n="351"
								id="vII351"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2360">
								<figDesc>Page 351.</figDesc>
							</figure> the mind to think, that Abigail Hobbs, wicked and shocking as
							her conduct had been towards Mr. Burroughs and others, came to herself,
							and offered her life in atonement for her sin.</p>
						<p>The Court continued the trials at successive sessions during the spring,
							all resulting in acquittals, until in May, 1693, Sir William Phips, by
							proclamation, discharged all. Hutchinson says, “Such a jail-delivery has
							never been known in New England.” The number then released is stated to
							have been one hundred and fifty. How many had been apprehended, during
							the whole affair, we have no means of knowing. Twenty, counting Giles
							Corey, had been executed. Two at least, Ann Foster and Sarah Osburn, had
							died in jail: it is not improbable that others perished under the bodily
							and mental sufferings there. We find frequent expressions indicating
							that many died in prison. A considerable number of children, and some
							adults whose friends were able to give the heavy bonds required and had
							influence enough to secure the favor, had some time before been removed
							to private custody. Quite a considerable number had succeeded in
							breaking jail and eluding recapture. Upon the whole, there must have
							been several hundreds committed. Even after acquittal by a jury, and the
							Governor's proclamation, none were set at liberty until they had paid
							all charges; including board for the whole time of their imprisonment,
							jailer's fees, and fees of Court of all kinds. The families of many had
							become utterly impoverished.</p>

						<p>The sufferings of the prisoners and of their relatives and connections

						<p>Margaret Jacobs had to remain in jail after the Governor's proclamation
							had directed the release of all prisoners, because she could not pay the
							fees and charges. Her grandfather had been executed, and all his
							furniture, stock, and moveable property seized by the marshal or
							sheriff. Her father escaped the warrant by a sudden flight from his home
							under the cover of midnight, and was in exile “beyond the seas;” her
							mother and herself taken at the time by the officers serving the
							warrants against them; the younger children of the family, left without
							protection, had dispersed, and been thrown upon the charity of
							neighbors; the house had been stripped of its contents, left open, and
							deserted. She had not a shilling in the world, and knew not where to
							look for aid. She <pb n="354" id="vII354"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2367">
								<figDesc>Page 354.</figDesc>
							</figure> was taken back to prison, and remained there for some time,
							until a person named Gammon, apparently a stranger, happened to hear of
							her case, and, touched with compassion, raised the money required, and
							released her. It was long before the affairs of the Jacobs' family were
							so far retrieved as to enable them to refund the money to the
							noble-hearted fisherman. How many others lingered in prison, or how
							long, we have no means of ascertaining.</p>
						<p>In reviewing the proceedings at the examinations and trials, it is
							impossible to avoid being struck with the infatuation of the magistrates
							and judges. They acted throughout in the character and spirit of
							prosecuting officers, put leading and ensnaring questions to the
							prisoners, adopted a browbeating deportment towards them, and pursued
							them with undisguised hostility. They assumed their guilt from the
							first, <pb n="355" id="vII355"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2368">
								<figDesc>Page 355.</figDesc>
							</figure> and endeavored to force them to confess; treating them as
							obstinate culprits because they would not. Every kind of irregularity
							was permitted. The marshal was encouraged in perpetual interference to
							prejudice the persons on trial, watching and reporting aloud to the
							Court every movement of their hands or heads or feet. Other persons were
							allowed to speak out, from the body of the crowd, whatever they chose to
							say adverse to the prisoner. Accusers were suffered to make private
							communications to the magistrates and judges before or during the
							hearings. The presiding officers showed off their smartness in attempts
							to make the persons on trial before them appear at a disadvantage. In
							some instances, as in the case of Sarah Good, the magistrate endeavored
							to deceive the accused by representing falsely the testimony given by
							another. The people in and around the court-room were allowed to act the
							part of a noisy mob, by clamors and threatening outcries; and juries
							were overawed to bring in verdicts of conviction, and rebuked from the
							bench if they exercised their rightful prerogative without regard to the
							public passions. The chief-justice, in particular, appears to have been
							actuated by violent prejudice against the prisoners, and to have
							conducted the trials, all along, with a spirit that bears the aspect of
							animosity.</p>
						<p>There is one point of view in which he must be held responsible for the
							blood that was shed, and the infamy that, in consequence, attaches to
							the proceedings. It may well be contended, that not a conviction would
								<pb n="356" id="vII356"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2369">
								<figDesc>Page 356.</figDesc>
							</figure> have taken place, but for a notion of his which he arbitrarily
							enforced as a rule of law. It was a part of the theory relating to
							witchcraft, that the Devil made use of the spectres, or apparitions, of
							some persons to afflict others. From this conceded postulate, a division
							of opinion arose. Some maintained that the Devil could employ only the
							spectres of persons in league with him; others affirmed, that he could
							send upon his evil errands the spectres of innocent persons, without
							their consent or knowledge. The chief-justice held the former opinion,
							against the judgment of many others, arbitrarily established it as a
							rule of Court, and peremptorily instructed juries to regard it as
							binding upon them in making their verdicts. The consequence was that a
							verdict of “Guilty” became inevitable. But few at that time doubted the
							veracity of the “afflicted persons,” which was thought to be
							demonstrated to the very senses by their fits and sufferings, in the
							presence of the Court, jury, and all beholders. When they swore that
							they saw the shapes of Bridget Bishop, or Rebecca Nurse, or George
							Burroughs, choking or otherwise torturing a person, the fact was
							regarded as beyond question.</p>
						<p>The prisoners took the ground, that the statements made by the witnesses,
							even if admitted, were not proof against them; for the Devil might
							employ the spectres of innocent persons, or of whomsoever he chose,
							without the knowledge of the persons whose shapes were thus used by him.
							When Mrs. Ann Putnam swore that she had seen the spectre of Rebecca
							Nurse <pb n="357" id="vII357"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2370">
								<figDesc>Page 357.</figDesc>
							</figure> afflicting various persons; and that the said spectre
							acknowledged to her, that “she had killed Benjamin Houlton, and John
							Fuller, and Rebecca Shepard,” — the answer of the prisoner was, “I
							cannot help it: the Devil may appear in my shape.” When the examining
							magistrate put the question to Susanna Martin, “How comes your
							appearance to hurt these?” Martin replied, “I cannot tell. He that
							appeared in Samuel's shape, a glorified saint, can appear in any one's
							shape.” The Rev. John Wise, in his noble appeal in favor of John
							Procter, argued to the same point. But the chief-justice was inexorably
							deaf to all reason; compelled the jury to receive, as absolute law, that
							the Devil could not use the shape of an innocent person; and, as the
							“afflicted” swore that they saw the shapes of the prisoners actually
							engaged in the diabolical work, there was no room left for question, and
							they must return a verdict of “Guilty.”</p>
						<p>In this way, innocent persons were slaughtered by a dogma in the mind of
							an obstinate judge. Dogmas have perverted courts and governments in all
							ages. A fabrication of fancy, an arbitrary verbal proposition, has been
							exalted above reason, and made to extinguish common sense. The world is
							full of such dogmas. They mislead the actions of men, and confound the
							page of history. “The king cannot die” is one of them. It is held as an
							axiom of political and constitutional truth. So an entire dynasty,
							crowded with a more glorious life than any other, is struck from the
							annals of an empire. In the public records of England, <pb n="358"
								id="vII358"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2371">
								<figDesc>Page 358.</figDesc>
							</figure> the existence of the Commonwealth is ignored; and the traces
							of its great events are erased from the archives of the government,
							which, in all its formulas and official papers, proclaims a lie. A
							hunted fugitive, wandering in disguise through foreign lands, without a
							foot of ground on the globe that he could call his own, is declared in
							all public acts, parliamentary and judicial, and even by those assuming
							to utter the voice of history, to have actually reigned all the time. In
							our country and in our day, we are perplexed, and our public men
							bewildered, by a similar dogma. The merest fabric of human contrivance,
							a particular form of political society, is impiously clothed with an
							essential attribute of God alone; and ephemeral politicians are
							announcing, as an eternal law of Providence, that “a State cannot die.”
							The mischiefs that result, in the management of human affairs, from
							enthroning dogmas over reason, truth, and fact, are, as they ever have
							been, incalculable.</p>
						<p>Chief-justice Stoughton appears to have kept his mind chained to his
							dogma to the last. It rendered him wholly incapable of opening his eyes
							to the light of truth. He held on to spectral evidence, and his
							corollary from it, when everybody else had abandoned both. He would not
							admit that he, or any one concerned, had been in error. He never could
							bear to hear any persons express penitence or regret for the part they
							had taken in the proceedings. When the public delusion had so far
							subsided that it became difficult to procure the execution of a witch,
							he was <pb n="359" id="vII359"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2372">
								<figDesc>Page 359.</figDesc>
							</figure> disturbed and incensed to such a degree that he abandoned his
							seat on the bench. During a session of the Court at Charlestown, in
							January, 1692-3, “word was brought in, that a reprieve was sent to
							Salem, and had prevented the execution of seven of those that were there
							condemned, which so moved the chief judge that he said to this effect:
							`We were in a way to have cleared the land of them; who it is that
							obstructs the cause of justice, I know not: the Lord be merciful to the
							country!' and so went off the bench, and came no more into that
							Court.”</p>
						<p>I have spoken of the judges as appearing to be infatuated, not on account
							of the opinions they held on the subject of witchcraft, for these were
							the opinions of their age; nor from the peculiar doctrine their chief
							enforced upon them, for that was entertained by many, and, as a mere
							theory, was perhaps as logically deducible from the prevalent doctrines
							as any other. Their infatuation consisted in not having eyes to see, or
							ears to hear, evidences continually occurring of the untruthful arts and
							tricks of the afflicted children, of their cunning evasinos, and, in
							some instances, palpable falsehoods. Then, further, there was solid and
							substantial evidence before them that ought to have made them pause and
							consider, if not doubt and disbelieve. We find the following paper among
							the files: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Testimony of John Putnam, Sr., and Rebecca
									his Wife,</hi> saith that our son-in-law John Fuller, and our
								daughter Rebecca Shepard, did both of them die a most violent death
								(and died acting very strangely at the time of <pb n="360"
									id="vII360"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2373">
									<figDesc>Page 360.</figDesc>
								</figure> their death); further saith, that we did judge then that
								they both died of a malignant fever, and had no suspicion of
								withcraft of any, neither can we accuse the prisoner at the bar of
								any such thing.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>When we recall the testimony of Ann Putnam the mother, and find that the
							afflicted generally charged the death of the above-named persons upon
							the shape of Rebecca Nurse, we perceive how absolutely Captain John
							Putnam and his wife discredit their testimony. The opinion of the father
							and mother of Fuller and Shepard ought to have had weight with the
							Court. They were persons of the highest standing, and of recognized
							intelligence and judgment. They were old church-members, and eminently
							orthodox in all their sentiments. They were the heads of a great family.
							He had represented the town in the General Court the year before. No man
							in this part of the country was more noted for strong good sense than
							Captain John Putnam. This deposition is honorable to their memory, and
							clears them from all responsibility for the extent to which the
							afflicted persons were allowed to sway the judgment of the Court. Taken
							in connection with the paper signed by so large a portion of the best
							people of the village, in behalf of Rebecca Nurse, it proves that the
							blame for the shocking proceedings in the witchcraft prosecutions cannot
							be laid upon the local population, but rests wholly upon the Court and
							the public authorities.</p>
						<p>The Special Court that condemned the persons charged with witchcraft in
							1692 is justly open to <pb n="361" id="vII361"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2374">
								<figDesc>Page 361.</figDesc>
							</figure> censure for the absence of all discrimination of evidence, and
							for a prejudgment of the cases submitted to them. In view of the then
							existing law and the practice in the mother-country under it, they ought
							to have the benefit of the admission that they did, in other respects
							than those mentioned, no more and no worse than was to be expected. And
							Cotton Mather, in the “Magnalia,” vindicates them on this ground: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“They consulted the precedents of former times, and precepts laid
								down by learned writers about witchcraft; as, Keeble on the Common
								Law, chap. `Conjuration' (an author approved by the twelve judges of
								our nation): also, Sir Matthew Hale's Trials of Witches, printed
								anno 1682; Glanvill's Collection of Sundry Trials in England and
								Ireland in the years 1658, '61, '63, '64, and '81; Bernard's Guide
								to Jury-men; Baxter's and R. B., their histories about Witches, and
								their Discoveries; Cotton Mather's Memorable Providences relating to
								Witchcraft, printed 1685.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>So far as the medical profession at the time is concerned, it must be
							admitted that they bear a full share of responsibility for the
							proceedings. They gave countenance and currency to the idea of
							witchcraft in the public mind, and were very generally in the habit,
							when a patient did not do well under their prescriptions, of getting rid
							of all difficulty by saying that “an evil hand” was upon him. Their
							opinion to this effect is cited throughout, and appears in a large
							number of the documents. There were coroners' juries in cases where it
							was suspected that a person <pb n="362" id="vII362"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2375">
								<figDesc>Page 362.</figDesc>
							</figure> died of witchcraft. It is much to be regretted that none of
							their verdicts have been preserved. Drawn up by an attending
							“chirurgeon,” they would illustrate the state of professional science at
							that day, by informing us of the marks, indications, and conditions of
							the bodily organization by which the traces of the Devil's hand were
							believed to be discoverable. All we know is that, in particular cases,
							as that of Bray Wilkins's grandson Daniel, the jury found decisive proof
							that he had died by “an evil hand.”</p>
						<p>It is not to be denied or concealed, that the clergy were instrumental in
							bringing on the witchcraft delusion in 1692. As the supposed agents of
							the mischief belonged to the supernatural and spiritual world, which has
							ever been considered their peculiar province, it was thought that the
							advice and co-operation of ministers were particularly appropriate and
							necessary. Opposition to prevailing vices and attempts to reform society
							were considered at that time in the light of a conflict with Satan
							himself; and he was thought to be the ablest minister who had the
							greatest power over the invisible enemy, and could most easily and
							effectively avert his blows, and counteract his baleful influence. This
							gave the clergy the front in the battle against the hosts of Belial.
							They were proud of the position, and were stimulated to distinguish
							themselves in the conflict. Cotton Mather represents that ministers were
							honored by the special hostility of the great enemy of souls, “more
							dogged by the Devil than any other men,” just as, according to his
							philosophy, <pb n="363" id="vII363"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2376">
								<figDesc>Page 363.</figDesc>
							</figure> the lightning struck the steeples of churches more frequently
							than other buildings because the Prince of the Power of the Air
							particularly hated the places where the sound of the gospel was heard.
							There were, moreover, it is to be feared, ministers whose ambition to
							acquire influence and power had been allowed to become a ruling
							principle, and who favored the delusion because thereby their object
							could be most surely achieved by carrying the people to the greatest
							extremes of credulity, superstition, and fanatical blindness.</p>
						<p>But justice requires it to be said that the ministers, as a general
							thing, did not take the lead after the proceedings had assumed their
							most violent aspect, and the disastrous effects been fully brought to
							view. It may be said, on the contrary, that they took the lead, as a
							class, in checking the delusion, and rescuing the public mind from its
							control. Prior to the time when they were called upon to give their
							advice to the government, they probably followed Cotton Mather: after
							that, they seemed to have freed themselves generally from his influence.
							The names of Dane and Barnard of Andover, Higginson of Salem, Cheever of
							Marblehead, Hubbard and Wise of Ipswich, Payson and Phillips of Rowley,
							Allin of Salisbury, and Capen of Topsfield, appear in behalf of persons
							accused. To come forward in their defence shows courage, and proves that
							their influence was in the right direction, even while the proceedings
							were at their height. Mr. Hale, of Beverly, abandoned the prosecutions,
							and expressed <pb n="364" id="vII364"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2377">
								<figDesc>Page 364.</figDesc>
							</figure> his disapprobation of them, before the government or the Court
							relaxed the vigor of their operations, as is sufficiently proved by the
							fact that the “afflicted children” cried out against his wife. Willard,
							and James Allen, and Moody, and John Bailey, and even Increase Mather,
							of Boston, openly discountenanced the course things were taking. The
							latter circulated a letter from his London correspondent, a person whose
							opinion was entitled to weight, condemning in the strongest terms the
							doctrine of the chief-justice, as follows: “All that I speak with much
							wonder that any man, much less a man of such abilities, learning, and
							experience as Mr. Stoughton, should take up a persuasion that the Devil
							cannot assume the likeness of an innocent, to afflict another person. In
							my opinion, it is a persuasion utterly destitute of any solid reason to
							render it so much as probable.” The ministers may have been among the
							first to bring on the delusion; but the foregoing facts prove, that, as
							a profession, they were the first to attempt to check and discountenance
							the prosecutions. While we are required, in all fairness, to give this
							credit to the clergy in general, it would be false to the obligations of
							historical truth and justice to attempt to palliate the conduct of some
							of them. Whoever considers all that Mr. Parris, according to his own
							account, said and did, cannot but shrink from the necessity of passing
							judgment upon him, and find relief in leaving him to that tribunal which
							alone can measure the extent of human responsibility, <pb n="365"
								id="vII365"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2378">

							</figure> and sound the depths of the heart. Lawson threw into the
							conflagration all the combustible materials his eloquence and talents,
							heated, it is to be feared, by resentment, could contribute. Dr.
							Bentley, in his “Description and History of Salem” (Mass. Hist. Coll.,
							1st series, vol. vi.) says, “Mr. Noyes came out and publicly confessed
							his error, never concealed a circumstance, never excused himself;
							visited, loved, blessed, the survivors whom he had injured; asked
							forgiveness always, and consecrated the residue of his life to bless
							mankind.” It is to be hoped that the statement is correct. There were
							several points of agreement between Noyes and Bentley. Both were men of
							ability and learning. Like Bentley, Noyes lived and died a bachelor;
							and, like him, was a man of lively and active temperament, and, in the
							general tenor of his life, benevolent and disinterested. Perhaps
							congeniality in these points led Bentley to make the statement, just
							quoted, a little too strong. He wrote more than a century after the
							witchcraft proceedings; just at that point when tradition had become
							inflated by all manner of current talk, of fable mixed with fact, before
							the correcting and expunging hand of a severe scrutiny of records and
							documents had commenced its work. The drag-net of time had drawn along
							with it every thing that anybody had said; but the process of sifting
							and discrimination had not begun. His kindly and ingenuous nature led
							him to believe, and prompted him to write down, all that was amiable,
							and pleasing to a mind like his. So far as the <pb n="366" id="vII366"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2379">
								<figDesc>Page 366.</figDesc>
							</figure> records and documents give us information, there is reason to
							apprehend, that Mr. Noyes, like Stoughton, another old bachelor, never
							recovered his mind from the frame of feeling or conviction in which it
							was during the proceedings. His name is not found, as are those of other
							ministers, to any petitions, memorials or certificates, in favor of the
							sufferers during the trials, or of reparation to their memories or to
							the feelings of their friends. He does not appear to have taken any part
							in arresting the delusion or rectifying the public mind.</p>
						<p>Of Cotton Mather, more is required to be said. He aspired to be
							considered the leading champion of the Church, and the most successful
							combatant against the Satanic powers. He seems to have longed for an
							opportunity to signalize himself in this particular kind of warfare;
							seized upon every occurrence that would admit of such a coloring to
							represent it as the result of diabolical agency; circulated in his
							numerous publications as many tales of witchcraft as he could collect
							throughout New and Old England, and repeatedly endeavored to get up
							cases of the kind in Boston. There is some ground for suspicion that he
							was instrumental in originating the fanaticism in Salem; at any rate, he
							took a leading part in fomenting it. And while there is evidence that he
							endeavored, after the delusion subsided, to escape the disgrace of
							having approved of the proceedings, and pretended to have been in some
							measure opposed to them, it can be too clearly shown that he was
							secretly and cunningly endeavoring to <pb n="367" id="vII367"/>

						<p>How blind is man to the future! The state of things which Cotton Mather
							labored to bring about, in order that he might increase his own
							influence over an infatuated people, by being regarded by them as mighty
								<pb n="368" id="vII368"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2381">
								<figDesc>Page 368.</figDesc>
							</figure> to cast out and vanquish evil spirits, and as able to hold
							Satan himself in chains by his prayers and his piety, brought him at
							length into such disgrace that his power was broken down, and he became
							the object of public ridicule and open insult. And the excitement that
							had been produced for the purpose of <pb n="369" id="vII369"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2382">
								<figDesc>Page 369.</figDesc>
							</figure> restoring and strengthening the influence of the clerical and

							prominent ministers with the witchcraft delusion brought a reproach upon
							the clergy from which they have not yet recovered.</p>

						</p>
						<p>In addition to the designing exertions of ambitious ecclesiastics, and
							the benevolent and praiseworthy efforts of those whose only aim was to
							promote a real and thorough reformation of religion, all the passions of
							our nature stood ready to throw their concentrated energy into the

							<figure id="Uphv2384">
								<figDesc>Page 371.</figDesc>
							</figure> fanatical propensities of the ignorant and deluded multitude,
							united with the best feelings of our nature to heighten the fury of the
							storm. Piety was indignant at the supposed rebellion against the
							sovereignty of God, and was roused to an extreme of agitation and
							apprehension in witnessing such a daring and fierce assault by the Devil
							and his adherents upon the churches and the cause of the gospel. Virtue
							was shocked at the tremendous guilt of those who were believed to have
							entered the diabolical confederacy; while public order and security
							stood aghast, amidst the invisible, the supernatural, the infernal, and
							apparently the irresistible attacks that were making upon the
							foundations of society. In baleful combination with principles, good in
							themselves, thus urging the passions into wild operation, there were all
							the wicked and violent affections to which humanity is liable.
							Theological bitterness, personal animosities, local controversies,
							private feuds, long-cherished grudges, and professional jealousies,
							rushed forward, and raised their discordant voices, to swell the
							horrible din; credulity rose with its monstrous and ever form, on the
							ruins of truth, reason, and the senses; malignity and cruelty rode
							triumphant through the storm, by whose fury every mild and gentle
							sentiment had been shipwrecked; and revenge, smiling in the midst of the
							tempest, welcomed its desolating wrath as it dashed the mangled objects
							of its hate along the shore.</p>
						<p>The treatment of the prisoners, by the administrative <pb n="372"

							<figure id="Uphv2385">
								<figDesc>Page 372.</figDesc>
							</figure> and subordinate officers in charge of them, there is reason to
							apprehend, was more than ordinarily harsh and unfeeling. The fate of
							Willard prevented expressions of kindness towards them. The crime of
							which they were accused put them outside of the pale of human charities.
							All who believed them guilty looked upon them, not only with horror, but
							hate. To have deliberately abandoned God and heaven, the salvation of
							Christ and the brotherhood of man, was regarded as detestable,
							execrable, and utterly and for ever damnable. This was the universal
							feeling at the time when the fanaticism was at its height; or, if there
							were any dissenters, they dared not show themselves. What the poor
							innocent sufferers experienced of cruelty, wrong, and outrage from this
							cause, it is impossible for words to tell. It left them in prison to
							neglect, ignominious ill-treatment, and abusive language from the
							menials having charge of them; it made their trials a brutal mockery; it
							made the pathway to the gallows a series of insults from an exasperated
							mob. If dear relatives or faithful friends kept near them, they did it
							at the peril of their lives, and were forbidden to utter the sentiments
							with which their hearts were breaking. There was no sympathy for those
							who died, or for those who mourned.</p>
						<p>It may seem strange to us, at this distance of time, and with the
							intelligence prevalent in this age, that persons of such known,
							established, and eminent reputation as many of those whose cases have
							been particularly <pb n="373" id="vII373"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2386">
								<figDesc>Page 373.</figDesc>
							</figure> noticed, could possibly have been imagined guilty of the crime
							imputed to them. The question arises in every mind, Why did not their
							characters save them from conviction, and even from suspicion? The
							answer is to be found in the peculiar views then entertained of the
							power and agency of Satan. It was believed that it would be one of the
							signs of his coming to destroy the Church of Christ, that some of the
							“elect” would be seduced into his service, — that he would drag captive
							in his chains, and pervert into instruments to further his wicked cause,
							many who stood among the highest in the confidence of Christians. This
							belief made them more vehement in their proceedings against ministers,
							church-members, and persons of good repute, who were proved, by the
							overwhelming evidence of the “afflicted children” and the confessing
							witches, to have made a compact with the Devil. There is reason to fear
							that Mr. Burroughs, and all accused persons of the highest reputation
							before for piety and worth, especially all who had been professors of
							religion and accredited church, suffered more than others from the
							severity of the judges and executive officers of the law, and from the
							rage and hatred of the people. It was indeed necessary, in order to keep
							up the delusion and maintain the authority of the prosecutions, to break
							down the influence of those among the accused and the sufferers who had
							stood the highest, and bore themselves the best through the fiery ordeal
							of the examinations, trials, and executions.</p>

							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>It is indeed a very remarkable fact, which has justly been enlarged upon
							by several who have had their attention turned to this subject, that, of
							the whole number that suffered, none, in the final scene, lost their
							fortitude for a moment. Many were quite aged; a majority, women, of whom
							some, brought up in delicacy, were wholly unused to rough treatment or
							physical suffering. They must have undergone the most dreadful
							hardships, suddenly snatched from their families and homes; exposed to a
							torrent of false accusations imputing to them the most odious, shameful,
							and devilish crimes; made objects of the abhorrence of their neighbors,
							and, through the notoriety of the affair, of the world; carried to and
							fro, over rugged roads, from jail to jail, too often by unfeeling
							sub-officials; immured in crowded, filthy, and noisome prisons; heavily
							loaded with chains, in dungeons; left to endure insufficient attention
							to necessary personal wants, often with inadequate food and clothing;
							all expressions of sympathy for them withheld and forbidden, — those who
							ought to have been their comforters denouncing them in the most awful
							language, and consigning them to the doom of excommunication from the
							church on earth and from the hope of heaven. Surely, there have been few
							cases in the dark and mournful annals of human suffering and wrong, few
							instances of “man's inhumanity to man,” to be compared with what the
							victims of this tragedy endured. Their bearing through the whole, from
							the arrest to the scaffold, reflects <pb n="375" id="vII375"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2388">
								<figDesc>Page 375.</figDesc>
							</figure> credit upon our common nature. The fact that Wardwell lost his
							firmness, for a time, ought not to exclude his name from the honored
							list. Its claim to be enrolled on it was nobly retrieved by his
							recantation, and his manly death.</p>
						<p>There is one consideration that imparts a higher character to the
							deportment of these persons than almost any of the tests to which the
							firmness of the mind of man has ever been exposed. There was nothing
							outside of the mind to hold it up, but every thing to bear it down. All
							that they had in this world, all on which they could rest a hope for the
							next, was the consciousness of their innocence. Their fidelity to this
							sense of innocence — for a lie would have saved them — their unfaltering
							allegiance to this consciousness; the preservation of a calm, steadfast,
							serene mind; their faith and their prayers, rising above the
							maledictions of a maniac mob, in devotion to God and forgiveness to men,
							and, as in the case of Martha Corey and George Burroughs, in clear and
							collected expressions, — this was truly sublime. It was appreciated, at
							the time, by many a heart melted back to its humanity; and paved the way
							for the deliverance of the world, we trust for ever, from all such
							delusions, horrors, and spectacles. The sufferers in 1692 deserve to be
							held in grateful remembrance for having illustrated the dignity of which
							our nature is capable; for having shown that integrity of conscience is
							an armor which protects the peace of the soul against all the powers
							that can assail it; and for having given an <pb n="376" id="vII376"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2389">
								<figDesc>Page 376.</figDesc>
							</figure> example, that will be seen of all and in all times, of a
							courage, constancy, and faithfulness of which all are capable, and which
							can give the victory over infirmities of age, weaknesses and pains of
							body, and the most appalling combination of outrages to the mind and
							heart that can be accumulated by the violence and the wrath of man.
							Superstition and ignorance consigned their names to obloquy, and
							shrouded them in darkness. But the day has dawned; the shadows are
							passing away; truth has risen; the reign of superstition is over; and
							justice will be done to all who have been true to themselves, and stood
							fast to the integrity of their souls, even to the death.</p>
						<p>The place selected for the executions is worthy of notice. It was at a
							considerable distance from the jail, and could be reached only by a
							circuitous and difficult route. It is a fatiguing enterprise to get at
							it now, although many passages that approach it from some directions
							have since been opened. But it was a point where the spectacle would be
							witnessed by the whole surrounding country far and near, being on the
							brow of the highest eminence in the vicinity of the town. As it was
							believed by the people generally that they were engaged in a great
							battle with Satan, one of whose titles was “the Prince of the Power of
							the Air,” perhaps they chose that spot to execute his confederates,
							because, in going to that high point, they were flaunting him in his
							face, celebrating their triumph over him in his own realm. There is no
							contemporaneous nor immediately subsequent record, that <pb n="377"
								id="vII377"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2390">
								<figDesc>Page 377.</figDesc>
							</figure> the executions took place on the spot assigned by tradition;
							but that tradition has been uniform and continuous, and appears to be
							verified by a singular item of evidence that has recently come to light.
							A letter written by the late venerable Dr. Holyoke to a friend at a
							distance, dated Salem, Nov. 25, 1791, has found its way back to the
							possession of one of his grand, which contains the following passage:
							“In the last month, there died a man in this town, by the name of John
							Symonds, aged a hundred years lacking about six months, having been born
							in the famous '92. He has told me that his nurse had often told him,
							that, while she was attending his mother at the time she lay in with
							him, she saw, from the chamber windows, those unhappy people hanging on
							Gallows' Hill, who were executed for witches by the delusion of the
							times.” John Symonds lived and died near the southern end of Beverly
							Bridge, on the south side of what is now Bridge Street. He was buried
							from his house, and Dr. Bentley made the funeral prayer, in which he is
							said to have used this language: “O God! the man who with his own hands
							felled the trees, and hewed the timbers, and erected the house in which
							we are now assembled, was the ancestor of him whose remains we are about
							to inter.” It is inferrible from this that Symonds was born in the house
							from which he was buried. Gallows Hill, now “Witch Hill” is in full view
							from that spot, and would be from the chamber windows of a house there,
							at any time, even in the season when intervening trees were in their <pb
								n="378" id="vII378"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2391">
								<figDesc>Page 378.</figDesc>
							</figure> fullest foliage, while no other point in that direction would
							be discernible. From the only other locality of persons of the name of
							Symonds, at that time, in North Fields near the North Bridge, Witch Hill
							is also visible, and the only point in that direction that then would
							have been.</p>
						<p>“Witch Hill” is a part of an elevated ledge of rock on the western side
							of the city of Salem, broken at intervals; beginning at Legg's Hill, and
							trending northerly. The turnpike from Boston enters Salem through one of
							the gaps in this ridge, which has been widened, deepened, and graded.
							North of the turnpike, it rises abruptly to a considerable elevation,
							called “Norman's Rocks.” At a distance of between three and four hundred
							feet, it sinks again, making a wide and deep gulley; and then, about a
							third of a mile from the turnpike, it re-appears, in a precipitous and,
							at its extremity, inaccessible cliff, of the height of fifty or sixty
							feet. Its southern and western aspect, as seen from the rough land north
							of the turnpike, is given in the headpiece of the Third Part, at the
							beginning of this volume. Its sombre and desolate appearance admits of
							little variety of delineation. It is mostly a bare and naked ledge. At
							the top of this cliff, on the southern brow of the eminence, the
							executions are supposed to have taken place. The outline rises a little
							towards the north, but soon begins to fall off to the general level of
							the country. From that direction only can the spot be easily reached. It
							is hard to climb the western side, impossible to clamber <pb n="379"
								id="vII379"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2392">
								<figDesc>Page 379.</figDesc>
							</figure> up the southern face. Settlement creeps down from the north,
							and has partially ascended the eastern acclivity, but can never reach
							the brink. Scattered patches of soil are too thin to tempt cultivation,
							and the rock is too craggy and steep to allow occupation. An active and
							flourishing manufacturing industry crowds up to its base; but a
							considerable surface at the top will for ever remain an open space. It
							is, as it were, a platform raised high in air.</p>
						<p>A magnificent panorama of ocean, island, headland, bay, river, town,
							field, and forest spreads out and around to view. On a clear summer day,
							the picture can scarcely be surpassed. Facing the sun and the sea, and
							the evidences of the love and bounty of Providence shining over the
							landscape, the last look of earth must have suggested to the sufferers a
							wide contrast between the mercy of the Creator and the wrath of his
							creatures. They beheld the face of the blessed God shining upon them in
							his works, and they passed with renewed and assured faith into his more
							immediate presence. The elevated rock, uplifted by the divine hand, will
							stand while the world stands, in bold relief, and can never be obscured
							by the encroachments of society or the structures of art, — a fitting
							memorial of their constancy.</p>
						<p>When, in some coming day, a sense of justice, appreciation of moral
							firmness, sympathy for suffering innocence, the diffusion of refined
							sensibility, a discriminating discernment of what is really worthy of
							commemoration among men, a rectified taste, a generous <pb n="380"
								id="vII380"/>

							</figure> public spirit, and gratitude for the light that surrounds and
							protects us against error, folly, and fanaticism, shall demand the
							rearing of a suitable monument to the memory of those who in 1692
							preferred death to a falsehood, the pedestal for the lofty column will
							be found ready, reared by the Creator on a foundation that can never be
							shaken while the globe endures, or worn away by the elements, man, or
							time — the brow of Witch Hill. On no other spot could such a tribute be
							more worthily bestowed, or more conspicuously displayed.</p>

								October, 1692, Thomas Hart, of Lynn, presented a memorial to the
								General Court, stating that his mother, Elizabeth Hart, had then
								been in Boston jail for nearly six months: “Though, in all this
								time, nothing has appeared against her whereby to render her
								deserving of imprisonment or death,... being ancient, and not able
								to undergo the hardship that is inflicted from lying in misery, and
								death rather to be chosen than a life in her circumstances.” He
								says, that his father is “ancient and decrepit, and wholly unable”
								to take any steps in her behalf; that he feels “obliged by all
								Christian duty, as becomes a child to parents,” to lay her case
								before the General Court. “The petitioner having lived from his
								childhood under the same roof with his mother, he dare presume to

								wherein there was any show of impiety nor witchcraft by her; and,

								enjoyments thereof, nourish or support any creature that he knew
								engaged in the drudgery of Satan. It is well known to all the

								godly life, always ready to discharge the part of a good Christian,
								and never deserving of afflictions from the hands of men for any
								thing of this nature.” He humbly prays “for the speedy enlargement
								of this person so much abused.” I present two more petitions. They

								having been active in carrying on the delusion in Salem and
								elsewhere, and, at the same time, to keep up such a degree of
								credulity and superstition in the minds of the people as to render
								it easy to plunge them into it again at the first favorable moment.
								In the following passages, he endeavors to escape the odium that had
								been connected with the prosecutions: —</p>
							<q direct="unspecified">
								<p>“The world knows how many pages I have composed and published,

							</q>
							<p>In his Life of Sir William Phips, he endeavors to take the credit to
								himself of having doubted the propriety of the proceedings while
								they were in progress. This work was published without his name, in
								order that he might commend himself with more freedom. The advice
								given by the ministers of Boston and the vicinity to the government
								has been spoken of. Cotton Mather frequently took occasion to
								applaud and magnify the merit of this production. In one of his
								writings, he speaks of “the gracious words” it contained. In his
								Life of Phips, he thus modestly takes the credit of its authorship
								to himself: it was “drawn up, at their (the ministers') desire, by
								Mr. Mather the younger, as I have been informed.” And, in order the
								more effectually to give the impression that he was rather opposed
								to the proceedings, he quotes those portions of the paper which
								recommended caution and circumspection, leaving out those other
								passages in which it was vehemently urged to carry the proceedings
								on “speedily and vigorously.”</p>
							<p>This single circumstance is decisive of the disingenuity of Dr.
								Mather. As it was the purpose of the government, in requesting the
								advice of the ministers, to ascertain their opinion of the
								expediency of continuing the prosecutions, it was a complete and
								deliberate perversion and falsification of their answer to omit the
								passages which encouraged the proceedings, and to record those only
								which recommended caution and circumspection. The object of Mather
								in suppressing the important parts of the document has, however, in
								some measure been answered. As the “Magnalia,” within which his Life
								of Phips is embraced, is the usual and popular source of information
								and reference respecting the topics of which it treats, the opinion
								has prevailed, that the Boston ministers, especially “Mr. Mather the
								younger,” endeavored to prevent the transactions connected with the
								trial and execution of the supposed witches. Unfortunately, however,
								for the reputation of Cotton Mather, Hutchinson has preserved the
								address of the ministers entire: and it appears that they approved,
								applauded, and stimulated the prosecutions; and that the people of
								Salem and the surrounding country were the victims of a delusion,
								the principal promoters of which have, to a great degree, been
								sheltered from reproach by the dishonest artifice, which has now
								been exposed.</p>
							<p>But, like other ambitious and grasping politicans, he was anxious to
								have the support of all parties at the same time. After making court
								to those who were dissatisfied with the prosecutions, he thus
								commends himself to all who approved of them: —</p>
							<q direct="unspecified">
								<p>“And why, after all my unwearied cares and pains to rescue the
									miserable from the lions and bears of hell which had seized
									them, and after all my studies to disappoint the devils in their
									designs to confound my neighborhood, must I be driven to the
									necessity of an apology? Truly, the hard representations
									wherewith some ill men have reviled my conduct, and the
									countenance which other men have given to these representations,
									oblige me to give mankind some account of my behavior. No
									Christian can (I say none but evilworkers can) criminate my
									visiting such of my poor flock as have at any time fallen under
									the terrible and sensible molestations of evil angels. Let their
									afflictions have been what they will, I could not have answered
									it unto my glorious Lord, if I had withheld my just comforts and
									counsels from them; and, if I have also, with some exactness,
									observed the methods of the invisible world, when they have thus
									become observable, I have been but a servant of mankind in doing
									so: yea, no less a person than the venerable Baxter has more
									than once or twice, in the most public manner, invited mankind
									to thank me for that service.”</p>
							</q>

								<p>“Wherefore, instead of all apish shouts and jeers at histories
									which have such undoubted confirmation as that no man that has
									breeding enough to regard the common laws of human society will
									offer to doubt of them, it becomes us rather to adore the
									goodness of God, who does not permit such things every day to
									befall us all, as he sometimes did permit to befall some few of
									our miserable neighbors.</p>
								<p>“And it is a very glorious thing that I have now to mention: The
									devils have, with most horrid operations, broke in upon our
									neighborhood; and God has at such a rate overruled all the fury
									and malice of those devils, that all the afflicted have not only
									been delivered, but, I hope, also savingly brought home unto
									God; and the reputation of no one good person in the world has
									been damaged, but, instead thereof, the souls of many,
									especially of the rising generation, have been thereby awakened
									unto some acquaintance with religion. Our young people, who
									belonged unto the praying-meetings, of both sexes, apart, would
									ordinarily spend whole nights, by whole weeks together, in
									prayers and psalms upon these occasions, in which devotions the
									devils could get nothing but, like fools, a scourge for their
									own backs: and some scores of other young people, who were
									strangers to real piety, were now struck with the lively
									demonstrations of hell evidently set forth before their eyes,
									when they saw persons cruelly frighted, wounded and starved by
									devils, and scalded with burning brimstone, and yet so preserved
									in this tortured state, as that, at the end of one month's
									wretchedness, they were as able still to undergo another; so
									that, of these also, it might now be said, `Behold, they pray.'
									In the whole, the Devil got just nothing, but God got praises,
									Christ got subjects, the Holy Spirit got temples, the church got
									additions, and the souls of men got everlasting benefits. I am
									not so vain as to say that any wisdom or virtue of mine did
									contribute unto this good order of things; but I am so just as
									to say, I did not hinder this good.”</p>

						<p>The effects of the delusion upon the country at large were very
							disastrous. It cast its shadows over a broad surface, and they darkened
							the condition of generations. The material interests of the people long
							felt its blight. Breaking out at the opening of the season, it
							interrupted the planting and cultivating of the grounds. It struck an
							entire summer out of one year, and broke in upon another. The fields
							were neglected; fences, roads, barns, and even the meeting, went into
							disrepair. Burdens were accumulated upon the already over-taxed
							resources of the people. An actual scarcity of provisions, amounting
							almost to a famine, continued for some time to press upon families.
							Farms were brought under mortgage or sacrificed, and large numbers of
							the people were dispersed. One locality in the village, which was the
							scene of this wild and tragic fanaticism, bears to this day the marks of
							the blight then brought upon it. Although in the centre of a town
							exceeding almost <pb n="381" id="vII381"/>

							</figure> all others in its agricultural development and thrift, — every
							acre elsewhere showing the touch of modern improvement and culture, —
							the “old meeting-house road,” from the crossing of the Essex Railroad to
							the point where it meets the road leading north from Tapleyville, has
							to-day a singular appearance of abandonment. The Surveyor of Highways
							ignores it. The old, gray, moss-covered stone walls are dilapidated, and
							thrown out of line. Not a house is on either of its borders, and no gate
							opens or path leads to any. Neglect and desertion brood over the
							contiguous grounds. Indeed, there is but one house standing directly on
							the roadside until you reach the vicinity of the site of the old
							meeting-house; and that is owned and occupied by a family that bear the
							name and are the direct descendants of Rebecca Nurse. On both sides
							there are the remains of cellars, which declare that once it was lined
							by a considerable population. Along this road crowds thronged in 1692,
							for weeks and months, to witness the examinations.</p>
						<p>The ruinous results were not confined to the village, but extended more
							or less over the country generally. Excitement, wrought up to
							consternation, spread everywhere. People left their business and
							families, and came from distant points, to gratify their curiosity, and
							enable themselves to form a judgment of the character of the phenomena
							here exhibited. Strangers from all parts swelled the concourse, gathered
							to behold the sufferings of “the afflicted” as manifested at the
							examinations; and flocked to the surrounding <pb n="382" id="vII382"/>

							</figure> eminences and the grounds immediately in front of Witch Hill,
							to catch a view of the convicts as they approached the place selected
							for their execution, offered their dying prayers, and hung suspended
							high in air. Such scenes always draw together great multitudes. None
							have possessed a deeper, stronger, or stranger attraction; and never has
							the dread spectacle been held out to view over a wider area, or from so
							conspicuous a spot. The assembling of such multitudes so often, for such
							a length of time, and from such remote quarters, must have been
							accompanied and followed by wasteful, and in all respects deleterious,
							effects. The continuous or frequently repeated sessions of the
							magistrates, grand jury, and jury of trials; and the attendance of
							witnesses summoned from other towns, or brought from beyond the
							jurisdiction of the Province, and of families and parties interested
							specially in the proceedings, — must have occasioned an extensive and
							protracted interruption of the necessary industrial pursuits of society,
							and heavily increased the public burdens.</p>

						<p>What are we to think of those persons who commenced and continued the
							accusations, — the “afflicted children” and their associates?</p>
						<p>In some instances and to some extent, the steps they took and the
							testimony they bore may be explained by referring to the mysterious
							energies of the imagination, the power of enthusiasm, the influence of
							sympathy, and the general prevalence of credulity, <pb n="385"
								id="vII385"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2398">
								<figDesc>Page 385.</figDesc>
							</figure> ignorance, superstition, and fanaticism at the time; and it is
							not probable, that, when they began, they had any idea of the tremendous
							length to which they were finally led on.</p>
						<p>It was perhaps their original design to gratify a love of notoriety or of
							mischief by creating a sensation and excitement in their neighborhood,
							or, at the worst, to wreak their vengeance upon one or two individuals
							who had offended them. They soon, however, became intoxicated by the
							terrible success of their imposture, and were swept along by the frenzy
							they had occasioned. It would be much more congenial with our feelings
							to believe, that these misguided and wretched young persons early in the
							proceedings became themselves victims of the delusion into which they
							plunged every one else. But we are forbidden to form this charitable
							judgment by the manifestations of art and contrivance, of deliberate
							cunning and cool malice, they exhibited to the end. Once or twice they
							were caught in their own snare; and nothing but the blindness of the
							bewildered community saved them from disgraceful exposure and
							well-deserved punishment. They appeared as the prosecutors of every poor
							creature that was tried, and seemed ready to bear testimony against any
							one upon whom suspicion might happen to fall. It is dreadful to reflect
							upon the enormity of their wickedness, if they were conscious of
							imposture throughout. It seems to transcend the capabilities of human
							crime. There is, perhaps, a slumbering element in the heart of man, <pb
								n="386" id="vII386"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2399">
								<figDesc>Page 386.</figDesc>
							</figure> that sleeps for ever in the bosom of the innocent and good,
							and requires the perpetration of a great sin to wake it into action, but
							which, when once aroused, impels the transgressor onward with increasing
							momentum, as the descending ball is accelerated in its course. It may be
							that crime begets an appetite for crime, which, like all other
							appetites, is not quieted but inflamed by gratification.</p>
						<p>Their precise moral condition, the degree of guilt to be ascribed, and
							the sentence to be passed upon them, can only be determined by a
							considerate review of all the circumstances and influences around
							them.</p>
						<p>For a period embracing about two months, they had been in the habit of
							meeting together, and spending the long winter evenings, at Mr. Parris's
							house, practising the arts of fortune-telling, jugglery, and magic. What
							they had heard in the traditions and fables of a credulous and
							superstitious age, — stories handed down in the interior settlements,
							circulated in companies gathered around the hearths of farmhouses,
							indulging the excitements of terrified imaginations; filling each
							other's minds with wondrous tales of second-sight, ghosts and spirits
							from the unseen world, together with what the West-Indian or South
							slaves could add, — was for a long time the food of their fancies. They
							experimented continually upon what was the spiritualism of their day,
							and grew familiar with the imagery and the exhibitions of the
							marvellous. The prevalent notions concerning witchcraft <pb n="387"
								id="vII387"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2400">
								<figDesc>Page 387.</figDesc>
							</figure> operations and spectral manifestations came into full effect
							among them. Living in the constant contemplation of such things, their
							minds became inflamed and bewildered; and, at the same time, they grew
							expert in practising and exhibiting the forms of pretended
							supernaturalism, the conditions of diabolical distraction, and the
							terrors of demonology. Apparitions rose before them, revealing the
							secrets of the past and of the future. They beheld the present spectres
							of persons then bodily far distant. They declared in language, fits,
							dreams, or trance, the immediate operations upon themselves of the
							Devil, by the agency of his confederates. Their sufferings, while thus
							under “an evil hand,” were dreadful to behold, and soon drew wondering
							and horror-struck crowds around them.</p>
						<p>At this point, if Mr. Parris, the ministers, and magistrates had done
							their duty, the mischief might have been stopped. The girls ought to
							have been rebuked for their dangerous and forbidden sorceries and
							divinations, their meetings broken up, and all such tamperings with
							alleged supernaturalism and spiritualism frowned down. Instead of this,
							the neighboring ministers were summoned to meet at Mr. Parris's house to
							witness the extraordinary doings of the girls, and all they did was to
							indorse, and pray over, them. Countenance was thus given to their
							pretensions, and the public confidence in the reality of their
							statements established. Magistrates from the town, church, leading
							people, and people of all sorts, flocked to witness the awful power of
							Satan, as displayed in <pb n="388" id="vII388"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2401">
								<figDesc>Page 388.</figDesc>
							</figure> the tortures and contortions of the “afflicted children;” who
							became objects of wonder, so far as their feats were regarded, and of
							pity in view of their agonies and convulsions.</p>
						<p>The aspect of the evidence rather favors the supposition, that the girls
							originally had no design of accusing, or bringing injury upon, any one.
							But the ministers at Parris's house, physicians and others, began the
							work of destruction by pronouncing the opinion that they were bewitched.
							This carried with it, according to the received doctrine, a conviction
							that there were witches about; for the Devil could not act except
							through the instrumentality of beings in confederacy with him.
							Immediately, the girls were beset by everybody to say who it was that
							bewitched them. Yielding to this pressure, they first cried out upon
							such persons as might have been most naturally suggested to them, —
							Sarah Good, apparently without a regular home, and wandering with her
							children from house to house for shelter and relief; Sarah Osburn, a
							melancholy, broken-minded, bed-ridden person; and Tituba, a slave,
							probably of mixed African and Indian blood. At the examination of these
							persons, the girls were first brought before the public, and the awful
							power in their hands revealed to them. The success with which they acted
							their parts; the novelty of the scene; the ceremonials of the occasion,
							the magistrates in their imposing dignity and authority, the trappings
							of the marshal and his officers, the forms of proceeding, — all which
							they had never seen <pb n="389" id="vII389"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2402">
								<figDesc>Page 389.</figDesc>
							</figure> before; the notice taken of them; the importance attached to
							them; invested the affair with a strange fascination in their eyes, and
							awakened a new class of sentiments and ideas in their minds. A love of
							distinction and notoriety, and the several passions that are gratified
							by the expression by others of sympathy, wonder, and admiration, were
							brought into play. The fact that all eyes were upon them, with the
							special notice of the magistrates, and the entire confidence with which
							their statements were received, flattered and beguiled them. A fearful
							responsibility had been assumed, and they were irretrievably committed
							to their position. While they adhered to that position, their power was
							irresistible, and they were sure of the public sympathy and of being
							cherished by the public favor. If they faltered, they would be the
							objects of universal execration and of the severest penalties of law for
							the wrongs already done and the falsehoods already sworn to. There was
							no retracing their steps; and their only safety was in continuing the
							excitement they had raised. New victims were constantly required to
							prolong the delusion, fresh fuel to keep up the conflagration; and they
							went on to cry out upon others. With the exception of two of their
							number, who appear to have indulged spite against the families in which
							they were servants, there is no evidence that they were actuated by
							private grievances or by animosities personal to themselves. They were
							ready and sure to wreak vengeance upon any who expressed doubts about
							the truth of their <pb n="390" id="vII390"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2403">
								<figDesc>Page 390.</figDesc>
							</figure> testimony, or the propriety of the proceedings; but, beyond
							this, they were very indifferent as to whom they should accuse. They
							were willing, as to that matter, to follow the suggestions of others,
							and availed themselves of all the gossip and slander and unfriendly talk
							in their families that reached their ears. It was found, that a hint,
							with a little information as to persons, places, and circumstances,
							conveyed to them by those who had resentments and grudges to gratify,
							would be sufficient for the purpose. There is reason to fear, that there
							were some behind them, giving direction to the accusations, and managing
							the frightful machinery, all the way through. The persons who were
							apprehended had, to a considerable extent, been obnoxious, and subject
							to prejudice, in connection with quarrels and controversies related in
							Part I., vol. i. They were “Topsfield men,” or the opponents of Bayley
							or of Parris, or more or less connected with some other feuds. As
							further proof that the girls were under the guidance of older heads, it
							is obvious, that there was, in the order of the proceedings, a skilful
							arrangement of times, sequences, and concurrents, that cannot be
							ascribed to them. No novelist or dramatist ever laid his plot deeper,
							distributed his characters more artistically, or conducted more
							methodically the progress of his story.</p>
						<p>In the mean while, they were becoming every day more perfect in the
							performance of their parts; and their imaginative powers, nervous
							excitability, and flexibility and rapidity of muscular action, were kept
								<pb n="391" id="vII391"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2404">
								<figDesc>Page 391.</figDesc>
							</figure> under constant stimulus, and attaining a higher development.
							The effect of these things, so long continued in connection with the
							perpetual pretence, becoming more or less imbued with the character of
							belief, of their alliance and communion with spiritual beings and
							manifestations, may have unsettled, to some extent, their minds. Added
							to this, a sense of the horrid consequences of their actions,
							accumulating with every pang they inflicted, the innocent blood they
							were shedding, and the depths of ruin into which they were sinking
							themselves and others, not only demoralized, but to some extent,
							perhaps, crazed them. It is truly a marvel that their physical
							constitutions did not break down under the exhausting excitements, the
							contortions of frame, the force to which the bodily functions were
							subjected in trances and fits, and the strain upon all the vital
							energies, protracted through many months. The wonder, however, would
							have been greater, if the mental and moral balance had not thereby been
							disturbed.</p>
						<p>Perpetual conversance with ideas of supernaturalism; daily and nightly
							communications, whether in the form of conscious imposture or honest
							delusion, with the spiritual world, continued through a great length of
							time, — as much at least as the exclusive contemplation of any one idea
							or class of ideas, — must be allowed to be unsalutary. Whatever keeps
							the thoughts wholly apart from the objects of real and natural life, and
							absorbs them in abstractions, cannot be favorable to the soundness of
							the faculties or the tone of the <pb n="392" id="vII392"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2405">
								<figDesc>Page 392.</figDesc>
							</figure> mind. This must especially be the effect, if the subjects thus
							monopolizing the attention partake of the marvellous and mysterious.
							When these things are considered, and the external circumstances of the
							occasion, the wild social excitement, the consternation, confusion, and
							horror, that were all crowded and heaped up and kept pressing upon the
							soul without intermission for months, the wonder is, indeed, that not
							only the accusers, prosecutors, and sufferers, but the whole people, did
							not lose their senses. Never was the great boon of life, a sound mind in
							a sound body, more liable to be snatched away from all parties. The
							depositions of Ann Putnam, Sr., have a tinge of sadness; — a melancholy,
							sickly mania running through them. Something of the kind is, perhaps,
							more or less discernible in the depositions of others.</p>
						<p>Let us, then, relieve our common nature from the load of the imputation,
							that, in its normal state, it is capable of such inconceivable
							wickedness, by giving to these wretched persons the benefit of the
							supposition that they were more or less deranged. This view renders the
							lesson they present more impressive and alarming. Sin in all cases, when
							considered by a mind that surveys the whole field, is itself insanity.
							In the case of these accusers, it was so great as to prove, by its very
							monstrousness, that it had actually subverted their nature and
							overthrown their reason. They followed their victims to the gallows, and
							jeered, scoffed, insulted them in their dying hours. Sarah Churchill,
							according to the testimony of Sarah Ingersoll, <pb n="393" id="vII393"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2406">
								<figDesc>Page 393.</figDesc>
							</figure> on one occasion came to herself, and manifested the symptoms
							of a restored moral consciousness: but it was a temporary gleam, a lucid
							interval; and she passed back into darkness, continuing, as before, to
							revel in falsehood, and scatter destruction around her. With this single
							exception, there is not the slightest appearance of compunction or
							reflection among them. On the contrary, they seem to have been in a
							frivolous, sportive, gay frame of thought and spirits. There is,
							perhaps, in this view of their conduct and demeanor, something to
							justify the belief that they were really demented. The fact that a large
							amount of skilful art and adroit cunning was displayed by them is not
							inconsistent with the supposition that they had become partially insane;
							for such cunning and art are often associated with insanity.</p>
						<p>The quick wit and ready expedients of the “afflicted children” are very
							remarkable. They were prompt with answers, if any attempted to
							cross-examine them, extricated themselves most ingeniously if ever
							brought into embarrassment, and eluded all efforts to entrap or expose
							them. Among the papers is a deposition, the use of which at the trials
							is not apparent. It does not purport to bear upon any particular case.
							Joseph Hutchinson was a firm-minded man, of strong common sense. He
							could not easily be deceived; and, although he took part in the
							proceedings at the beginning, soon became opposed to them. It looks as
							if, by close questions put to the child, Abigail Williams, on some
							occasion of his casually meeting her, he had tried <pb n="394"
								id="vII394"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2407">
								<figDesc>Page 394.</figDesc>
							</figure> to expose the falseness of her accusations, and that he was
							made to put the conversation into the shape of a deposition. It is as
							follows:—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Joseph Hutchinson,</hi> aged
								fiftynine years, do testify as followeth: “Abigail Williams, I have
								heard you speak often of a book that has been offered to you. She
								said that there were two books: one was a short, thick book; and the
								other was a long book. I asked her what color the book was of. She
								said the books were as red as blood. I asked her if she had seen the
								books opened. She said she had seen it many times. I asked her if
								she did see any writing in the book. She said there were many lines
								written; and, at the end of every line, there was a seal. I asked
								her, who brought the book to her. She told me that it was the black
								man. I asked her who the black man was. She told me it was the
								Devil. I asked her if she was not afraid to see the Devil. She said,
								at the first she was, and did go from him; but now she was not
								afraid, but could talk with him as well as she could with me.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>There is an air of ease and confidence in the answers of Abigail, which
							illustrates the promptness of invention and assurance of their grounds
							which the girls manifested on all occasions. They were never at a loss,
							and challenged scrutiny. Hutchinson gained no advantage, and no one else
							ever did, in an encounter with them.</p>
						<p>Whatever opinion may be formed of the moral or mental condition of the
							“afflicted children,” as to their sanity and responsibility, there can
							be no doubt that they were great actors. In mere jugglery and <pb
								n="395" id="vII395"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2408">
								<figDesc>Page 395.</figDesc>
							</figure> sleight of hand, they bear no mean comparison with the workers
							of wonders, in that line, of our own day. Long practice had given them
							complete control over their countenances, intonations of voice, and the
							entire muscular and nervous organization of their bodies; so that they
							could at will, and on the instant, go into fits and convulsions, swoon
							and fall to the floor, put their frames into strange contortions, bring
							the blood to the face, and send it back again. They could be deadly pale
							at one moment, at the next flushed; their hands would be clenched and
							held together as with a vice; their limbs stiff and rigid or wholly
							relaxed; their teeth would be set; they would go through the paroxysms
							of choking and strangulation, and gasp for breath, bringing froth and
							blood from the mouth; they would utter all sorts of screams in unearthly
							tones; their eyes remain fixed, sometimes bereft of all light and
							expression, cold and stony, and sometimes kindled into flames of
							passion; they would pass into the state of somnambulism, without aim or
							conscious direction in their movements, looking at some point, where was
							no apparent object of vision, with a wild, unmeaning glare. There are
							some indications that they had acquired the art of ventriloquism; or
							they so wrought upon the imaginations of the beholders, that the sounds
							of the motions and voices of invisible beings were believed to be heard.
							They would start, tremble, and be pallid before apparitions, seen, of
							course, only by themselves; but their acting was so perfect that all
							present thought they saw them too. They would <pb n="396" id="vII396"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2409">
								<figDesc>Page 396.</figDesc>
							</figure> address and hold colloquy with spectres and ghosts; and the
							responses of the unseen beings would be audible to the fancy of the
							bewildered crowd. They would follow with their eyes the airy visions, so
							that others imagined they also beheld them. This was surely a high
							dramatic achievement. Their representations of pain, and every form and
							all the signs and marks of bodily suffering, — as in the case of Ann
							Putnam's arm, and the indentations of teeth on the flesh in many
							instances, — utterly deceived everybody; and there were men present who
							could not easily have been imposed upon. The Attorney-general was a
							barrister fresh from Inns of Court in London. Deodat Lawson had seen
							something of the world; so had Joseph Herrick. Joseph Hutchinson was a
							sharp, stern, and sceptical observer. John Putnam was a man of great
							practical force and discrimination; so was his brother Nathaniel, and
							others of the village. Besides, there were many from Boston and
							elsewhere competent to detect a trick; but none could discover any
							imposture in the girls. Sarah Nurse swore that she saw Goody Bibber
							cheat in the matter of the pins; but Bibber did not belong to the
							village, and was a bungling interloper. The accusing girls showed
							extraordinary skill, ingenuity, and fancy in inventing the stories to
							which they testified, and seemed to have been familiar with the imagery
							which belonged to the literature of demonology. This has led some to
							suppose that they must have had access to books treating the subject.
							Our fathers abhorred, with a perfect hatred, all theatrical exhibitions.
							It would <pb n="397" id="vII397"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2410">
								<figDesc>Page 397.</figDesc>
							</figure> have filled them with horror to propose going to a play. But
							unwittingly, week after week, month in and month out, ministers,
							deacons, brethren, and sisters of the church rushed to Nathaniel
							Ingersoll's, to the village and town meeting-houses, and to Thomas
							Beadle's Globe Tavern, and gazed with wonder, awe, and admiration upon
							acting such as has seldom been surpassed on the boards of any theatre,
							high or low, ancient or modern.</p>
						<p>There is another aspect that perplexes and confounds the judgments of all
							who read the story. It is this: As it is at present the universal
							opinion that the whole of this witchcraft transaction was a delusion,
							having no foundation whatever but in the imaginations and passions; and
							as it is now certain, that all the accused, both the condemned and the
							pardoned, were entirely innocent, — how can it be explained that so many
							were led to confess themselves guilty? The answer to this question is to
							be found in those general principles which have led the wisest
							legislators and jurists to the conclusion, that, although on their face
							and at first thought, they appear to be the very best kind of evidence,
							yet, maturely considered, confessions made under the hope of a benefit,
							and sometime even without the impulses of such a hope, are to be
							received with great caution and wariness. Here were fifty-five persons,
							who declared themselves guilty of a capital, nay, a diabolical crime, of
							which we know they were innocent. It is probable that the motive of
							self-preservation influenced most of them. An <pb n="398" id="vII398"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2411">
								<figDesc>Page 398.</figDesc>
							</figure> awful death was in immediate prospect. There was no escape
							from the wiles of the accusers. The delusion had obtained full
							possession of the people, the jury, and the Court. By acknowledging a
							compact with Satan, they could in a moment secure their lives and
							liberty. It was a position which only the firmest minds could safely
							occupy. The principles and the prowess of ordinary characters could not
							withstand the temptation and the pressure. They yielded, and were saved
							from an impending and terrible death.</p>
						<p>As these confessions had a decisive effect in precipitating the public
							mind into the depths of its delusion, gave a fatal power to the
							accusers, and carried the proceedings to the horrible extremities which
							have concentrated upon them the attention of the world, they assume an
							importance in the history of the affair that demands a full and thorough
							exposition. At the examination of Ann Foster, at Salem Village, on the
							15th of July, 1692, the following confession was, “after a while,”
							extorted from her. It was undoubtedly the result of the overwhelming
							effect of the horrors of her condition upon a distressed and half-crazed

								such a bird as she never saw the like before; and she had had this
								gift (viz., of striking the afflicted down with her eye) ever since.
								Being asked why she thought that bird was the Devil, she answered,
								because he came <pb n="399" id="vII399"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2412">
									<figDesc>Page 399.</figDesc>
								</figure> white and vanished away black; and that the Devil told her
								she should have this gift, and that she must believe him, and told
								her she should have prosperity: and she said that he had appeared to
								her three times, and always as a bird, and the last time about half
								a year since, and sat upon a table, — had two legs and great eyes,
								and that it was the second time of his appearance that he promised
								her prosperity. She further stated, that it was Goody Carrier that
								made her a witch. She told her, that, if she would not be a witch,
								the Devil would tear her to pieces, and carry her away, — at which
								time she promised to serve the Devil; that she was at the meeting of
								the witches at Salem Village; that Goody Carrier came, and told her
								of the meeting, and would have her go: so they got upon sticks, and
								went said journey, and, being there, did see Mr. Burroughs, the
								minister, who spake to them all; that there were then twenty persons
								met together; that she tied a knot in a rag, and threw it into the
								fire to hurt Timothy Swan, and that she did hurt the rest that
								complained of her by squeezing puppets like them, and so almost
								choked them; that she and Martha Carrier did both ride on a stick or
								pole when they went to the witch-meeting at Salem Village, and that
								the stick broke as they were carried in the air above the tops of
								the trees, and they fell: but she did hang fast about the neck of
								Goody Carrier, and they were presently at the village; that she had
								heard some of the witches say that there were three hundred and five
								in the whole country, and that they would ruin that place, the
								village; that there were also present at that meeting two men
								besides Mr. Burroughs, the minister, and one of them had gray hair;
								and that the discourse among the witches at the meeting in Salem
								Village was, that they would afflict there to set up the Devil's
								kingdom.</p>

						<p>The confession of which the foregoing is the substance appears to have
							been drawn out at four several examinations on different days, during
							which she was induced by the influences around her to make her testimony
							more and more extravagant at each successive examination. Her daughter,
							Mary Lacy, called Goody Lacy, was brought up on the charge of witchcraft
							at the same time; and, upon finding the mother confessing, she saw that
							her only safety was in confessing also. When confronted, the daughter
							cried out to the mother, “We have forsaken Jesus Christ, and the Devil
							hath got hold of us. How shall we get clear of this Evil One?” She
							proceeded to say that she had accompanied her mother and Goody Carrier,
							all three riding together on the pole, to Salem Village. She then made
							the following statement: “About three or four years ago, she saw
							Mistress Bradbury, Goody Howe, and Goody Nurse baptized by the old
							Serpent at Newbury Falls; that he dipped their heads in the water, and
							then said they were his, and he had power over them; that there were six
							baptized at that time, who were some of the chief or higher powers, and
							that there might be near about a hundred in company at that time.” It
							being asked her “after what manner she went to Newbury Falls,” she
							answered, “the Devil carried her in his arms.” She said, that, “if she
							did take a rag, and roll it up together, and imagine it to represent
							such and such a person, then that, whatsoever she did to that rag so
							rolled up, the person represented thereby would be <pb n="401"
								id="vII401"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2414">
								<figDesc>Page 401.</figDesc>
							</figure> in like manner afflicted.” Her daughter, also named Mary Lacy,
							followed the example of her mother and grandmother, and made
							confession.</p>
						<p>An examination of the confessions shows, that, when accused persons made
							up their minds to confess, they saw, that, to make their safety secure,
							it was necessary to go the whole length of the popular superstition and
							fanaticism. In many instances, they appear to have fabricated their
							stories with much ingenuity and tact, making them tally with the
							statements of the accusers, adding points and items that gave an air of
							truthfulness, and falling in with current notions and fancies. They were
							undoubtedly under training by the girls, and were provided with the
							materials of their testimony. Their depositions are valuable, inasmuch
							as they enable us to collect about the whole of the notions then
							prevalent on the subject. If, in delivering their evidences, any
							prompting was needed, the accusers were at their elbows, and helped them
							along in their stories. If, in any particular, they were in danger of
							contradicting themselves or others, they were checked or diverted. In
							one case, a confessing witch was damaging her own testimony, whereupon
							one of the afflicted cried out that she saw the shapes or apparitions of
							other witches interfering with her utterance. The witness took the hint,
							pretended to have lost the power of expressing herself, and was removed
							from the stand.</p>
						<p>In some cases, the confessing witches showed great adroitness, and
							knowledge of human nature. When <pb n="402" id="vII402"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2415">
								<figDesc>Page 402.</figDesc>
							</figure> a leading minister was visiting them in the prison, one of
							them cried out as he passed her cell, calling him by name, “Oh! I
							remember a text you preached on in England, twenty years since, from
							these words: `You sin will find you out;' for I find it to be true in my
							own case.” This skilful compliment, showing the power of his preaching
							making an impression which time could not efface, was no doubt
							flattering to the good man, and secured for her his favorable
							influence.</p>
						<p>Justice requires that their own explanation of the influences which led
							them to confess should not be withheld.</p>
						<p>The following declaration of six women belonging to Andover is
							accompanied by a paper signed by more than fifty of the most respectable
							inhabitants of that town, testifying to their good character, in which
							it is said that “by their sober, godly, and exemplary conversation, they

							esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members:” —</p>

								in the year 1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at
								Mr. Parris's house, several young persons, being seemingly
								afflicted, did accuse several persons for afflicting them; and many
								there believing it so to be, we being informed, that, if a person
								was sick, the afflicted person could tell what or who was the cause
								of that sickness: John Ballard of Andover, his wife being <pb

								</figure> sick at the same time, he, either from himself, or by the
								advice of others, fetched two of the persons called the afflicted
								persons from Salem Village to Andover, which was the beginning of
								that dreadful calamity that befell us in Andover, believing the said
								accusations to be true, sent for the said persons to come together
								to the meeting-house in Andover, the afflicted persons being there.
								After Mr. Barnard had been at prayer, we were blindfolded, and our
								hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their
								fits, and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence,
								as they said: and some led us, and laid our hands upon them; and
								then they said they were well, and that we were guilty of afflicting
								them. Whereupon we were all seized as prisoners, by a warrant from
								the justice of the peace, and forthwith carried to Salem; and by
								reason of that sudden surprisal, we knowing ourselves altogether
								innocent of that crime, we were all exceedingly astonished and
								amazed, and consternated and affrighted, even out of our reason; and
								our nearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful
								condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehended there was no
								other way to save our lives, as the case was then circumstanced, but
								by our confessing ourselves to be such and such persons as the
								afflicted represented us to be, they, out of tenderness and pity,
								persuaded us to confess what we did confess. And, indeed, that
								confession that it is said we made was no other than what was
								suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we were
								witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that
								it was so; and, our understandings, our reason, our faculties almost
								gone, we were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the

								</figure> every thing which they desired, and most of what we said
								was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Some time after,
								when we were better composed, they telling us what we had confessed,
								we did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things;
								and we hearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his confession,
								and was quickly after condemned and executed, some of us were told

						<p>The means employed, and the influences brought to bear upon persons

							relieve their confessions, to a great extent, of a criminal character.
							They were scarcely responsible moral agents. In the month of October,
							Increase Mather came to Salem, to confer with the confessing witches in
							prison. The result of his examinations is preserved in a document of
							which he is supposed to have been the author. The following extracts
							afford some explanation of the whole subject: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Goodwife Tyler did say, that, when she was first apprehended, she
								had no fears upon her, and did think that nothing could have made
								her confess against herself. But since, she had found, to her great
								grief, that she had wronged the truth, and falsely accused herself.
								She said that, when she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges
								rode with her; and that, all along the way from Andover to Salem,
									<pb n="405" id="vII405"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2418">
									<figDesc>Page 405.</figDesc>
								</figure> her brother kept telling her that she must needs be a
								witch, since the afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised
								out of their fits, and urging her to confess herself a witch. She as
								constantly told him that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of
								witchcraft, and begged him not to urge her to confess. However, when
								she came to Salem, she was carried to a room, where her brother on
								one side, and Mr. John Emerson on the other side, did tell her that
								she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the Devil before her
								eyes at that time (and, accordingly, the said Emerson would attempt
								with his hand to beat him away from her eyes); and they so urged her
								to confess, that she wished herself in any dungeon, rather than be
								so treated. Mr. Emerson told her, once and again, `Well, I see you
								will not confess! Well, I will now leave you; and then you are
								undone, body and soul, for ever.' Her brother urged her to confess,
								and told her that, in so doing, she could not lie: to which she
								answered, `Good brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if I
								confess, and then who shall answer unto God for my lie?' He still
								asserted it, and said that God would not suffer so many good men to
								be in such an error about it, and that she would be hanged if she
								did not confess; and continued so long and so violently to urge and
								press her to confess, that she thought, verily, that her life would
								have gone from her, and became so terrified in her mind that she
								owned, at length, almost any thing that they propounded to her; that
								she had wronged her conscience in so doing; she was guilty of a
								great sin in belying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long
								as she lived. This she said, and a great deal more of the like
								nature; and all with such affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and
								mourning, as that it exceeds any pen to describe and express the
								same.”</p>

							<p>“Goodwife Wilson said that she was in the dark as to some things in
								her confession. Yet she asserted that, knowingly, she never had
								familiarity with the Devil; that, knowingly, she never consented to
								the afflicting of any person, &amp;c. However, she said that truly
								she was in the dark as to the matter of her being a witch. And being
								asked how she was in the dark, she replied, that the afflicted
								persons crying out of her as afflicting them made her fearful of
								herself; and that was all that made her say that she was in the
								dark.”</p>
							<p>“Goodwife Bridges said that she had confessed against herself things
								which were all utterly false; and that she was brought to her
								confession by being told that she certainly was a witch, and so made
								to believe it, — though she had no other grounds so to believe.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Some explanation of the details which those, prevailed upon to confess,
							put into their testimony, and which seemed, at the time, to establish
							and demonstrate the truth of their statements, is afforded by what Mary
							Osgood is reported, by Increase Mather, to have said to him on this
							occasion: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Being asked why she prefixed a time, and spake of her being
								baptized, &amp;c., about twelve years since, she replied and said,
								that, when she had owned the thing, they asked the time, to which
								she answered that she knew not the time. But, being told that she
								did know the time, and must tell the time, and the like, she
								considered that about twelve years before (when she had her last
								child) she had a fit of sickness, and was melancholy; and so thought
								that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and
								accordingly did prefix the said time. Being asked about <pb n="407"
									id="vII407"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2420">
									<figDesc>Page 407.</figDesc>
								</figure> the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed that the
								Devil had appeared to her, &amp;c., she replied, that, being told
								that the Devil had appeared to her, and must needs appear to her,
								&amp;c. (she being a witch), she at length did own that the Devil
								had appeared to her; and, being pressed to say in what creature's
								shape he appeared, she at length did say that it was in the shape of
								a cat. Remembering that, some time before her being apprehended, as
								she went out at her door, she saw a cat, &amp;c.; not as though she
								any whit suspected the said cat to be the Devil, in the day of it,
								but because some creature she must mention, and this came into her
								mind at that time.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>This poor woman, as well as several others, besides Goodwife Tyler, who
							denied and renounced their confessions, manifested, as Dr. Mather
							affirms, the utmost horror and anguish at the thought that they could
							have been so wicked as to have belied themselves, and brought injury
							upon others by so doing. They “bewailed and lamented their accusing of
							others, about whom they never knew any evil” in their lives. They proved
							the sincerity of their repentance by abandoning and denouncing their
							confessions, and thus offering their lives as a sacrifice to atone for
							their falsehood. They were then awaiting their trial; and there seemed
							no escape from the awful fate which had befallen all persons brought to
							trial before, and who had not confessed or had withdrawn their
							confession. Fortunately for them, the Court did not meet again in 1692;
							and they were acquitted at the regular session, in the January
							following.</p>

						</p>
						<p>In one of Calef's tracts, he sums up his views, on the subject of the
							confessions, as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“Besides the powerful argument of life (and freedom from hardships,
								not only promised, but also performed to all that owned their
								guilt), there are numerous instances of the tedious examinations
								before private persons, many hours together; they all that time
								urging them to confess (and taking turns to persuade them), till the
								accused were wearied out by being forced to stand so long, or for
								want of sleep, &amp;c., and so brought to give assent to what they
								said; they asking them, `Were you at such a witch meeting?' or,
								`Have you signed the Devil's book?' &amp;c. Upon their replying
								`Yes,' the whole was drawn into form, as their confession.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>This accounts for the similarity of construction and substance of the
							confessions generally.</p>
						<p>Calef remarks:—</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“But that which did mightily further such confessions was their
								nearest relations urging them to it. These, seeing no other way of
								escape for them, thought it the best advice that could be given;
								hence it was, that the husbands of some, by counsel, often urging,
								and utmost earnestness, and children upon their knees intreating,
								have at length prevailed with them to say they were guilty.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>One of the most painful things in the whole affair was, that the absolute
							conviction of the guilt of the persons accused, pervading the community,
							took full effect upon the minds of many relatives and friends. They did
							not consider it as a matter of the least possible doubt. They therefore
							looked upon it as wicked <pb n="409" id="vII409"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2422">
								<figDesc>Page 409.</figDesc>
							</figure> obstinacy not to confess, and, in this sense, an additional
							and most conclusive evidence of a mind alienated from truth and wholly
							given over to Satan. This turned natural love and previous friendships
							into resentment, indignation, and abhorrence, which left the unhappy
							prisoners in a condition where only the most wonderful clearness of
							conviction and strength of character could hold them up. And, in many
							cases where they yielded, it was not from unworthy fear, or for
							self-preservation, but because their judgment was overthrown, and their
							minds in complete subjection and prostration.</p>
						<p>There can, indeed, hardly be a doubt, that, in some instances, the
							confessing persons really believed themselves guilty. To explain this,
							we must look into the secret chambers of the human soul; we must read
							the history of the imagination, and consider its power over the
							understanding. We must transport ourselves to the dungeon, and think of
							its dark and awful walls, its dreary hours, its tedious loneliness, its
							heavy and benumbing fetters and chains, its scanty fare, and all its
							dismal and painful circumstances. We must reflect upon their influence
							over a terrified and agitated, an injured and broken spirit. We must
							think of the situation of the poor prisoner, cut off from hope; hearing
							from all quarters, and at all times, morning, noon, and night, that
							there is no doubt of his guilt; surrounded and overwhelmed by
							accusations and evidence, gradually but insensibly mingling and
							confounding the visions and vagaries of his troubled <pb n="410"
								id="vII410"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2423">
								<figDesc>Page 410.</figDesc>
							</figure> dreams with the reveries of his waking hours, until his reason
							becomes obscured, his recollections are thrown into derangement, his
							mind loses the power of distinguishing between what is perpetually told
							him by others and what belongs to the suggestions of his own memory: his
							imagination at last gains complete ascendency over his other faculties,
							and he believes and declares himself guilty of crimes of which he is as
							innocent as the child unborn. The history of the transaction we have
							been considering, affords a clear illustration of the truth and
							reasonableness of this explanation.</p>
						<p>The facility with which persons can be persuaded, by perpetually
							assailing them with accusations of the truth of a charge, in reality not
							true, even when it is made against themselves, has been frequently
							noticed. Addison, in one of the numbers of his “Spectator,” speaks of it
							in connection with our present subject: “When an old woman,” says he,
							“begins to dote, and grow chargeable to a parish, she is generally
							turned into a witch, and fills the whole country with extravagant
							fancies, imaginary distempers, and terrifying dreams. In the mean time,
							the poor wretch that is the innocent occasion of so many evils begins to
							be frighted at herself, and sometimes confesses secret commerces and
							familiarities that her imagination forms in a delirious old age. This
							frequently cuts off charity from the greatest objects of compassion, and
							inspires people with a malevolence towards those poor, decrepit parts of
							our species <pb n="411" id="vII411"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2424">
								<figDesc>Page 411.</figDesc>
							</figure> in whom human nature is defaced by infirmity and dotage.”</p>
						<p>This passage is important, in addition to the bearing it has upon the
							point we have been considering, as describing the state of opinion and
							feeling in England twenty years after the folly had been exploded here.
							In another number of the same series of essays, he bears evidence, that
							the superstitions which here came to a head in 1692 had long been
							prevalent in the mother-country: “Our forefathers looked upon nature
							with more reverence and horror before the world was enlightened by
							learning and philosophy, and loved to astonish themselves with the
							apprehensions of witchcraft, prodigies, charms, and enchantments. There
							was not a village in England that had not a ghost in it; the churchyards
							were all haunted; every large common had a circle of fairies belonging
							to it; and there was scarce a shepherd to be met with who had not seen a
							spirit.” These fancies still linger in the minds of some in the Old
							World and in the New.</p>
						<p>After allowing for the utmost extent of prevalent superstitions, the
							exaggerations incident to a state of general excitement, and the fertile
							inventive faculties of the accusing girls, there is much in the evidence
							that cannot easily be accounted for. In other cases than that of
							Westgate, we find the symptoms of that bewildered condition of the
							senses and imagination not at all surprising or unusual in the
							experience of men staggering home in midnight hours from tavern haunts.
							Disturbed dreams were, it is <pb n="412" id="vII412"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2425">
								<figDesc>Page 412.</figDesc>
							</figure> not improbable, a fruitful source of delusion. A large part of
							the evidence is susceptible of explanation by the supposition, that the
							witnesses had confounded the visions of their sleeping, with the actual
							observations and occurrences of their waking hours. At the trial of
							Susanna Martin, it was in evidence, that one John Kembal had agreed to
							purchase a puppy from the prisoner, but had afterwards fallen back from
							his bargain, and procured a puppy from some other person, and that
							Martin was heard to say, “If I live, I will give him puppies enough.”
							The circumstances seem to me to render it probable, that the following
							piece of evidence given by Kembal, and to which the Court attached great
							weight, was the result of a nightmare occasioned by his apprehension and
							dread of the fulfilment of the reported threat: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“I, this deponent, coming from his intended house in the woods to
								Edmund Elliot's house where I dwelt, about the sunset or presently
								after; and there did arise a little black cloud in the north-west,
								and a few drops of rain, and the wind blew pretty hard. In going
								between the house of John Weed and the meeting-house, this deponent
								came by several stumps of trees by the wayside; and he by impulse he
								can give no reason of, that made him tumble over the stumps one
								after another, though he had his axe upon his shoulder which put him
								in much danger, and made him resolved to avoid the next, but could
								not.</p>
							<p>“And, when he came a little below the meeting-house, there did appear
								a little thing like a puppy, of a darkish color. It shot between my
								legs forward and backward, as <pb n="413" id="vII413"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2426">
									<figDesc>Page 413.</figDesc>
								</figure> one that were dancing the hay.<note target="v2n7"
									place="unspecified" anchored="yes">*</note> And this deponent,
								being free from all fear, used all possible endeavors to cut it with
								his axe, but could not hurt it; and, as he was thus laboring with
								his axe, the puppy gave a little jump from him, and seemed to go
								into the ground.</p>
							<p>“In a little further going, there did appear a black puppy, somewhat
								bigger than the first, but as black as a coal to his apprehension,
								which came against him with such violence as its quick motions did
								exceed his motions of his axe, do what he could. And it flew at his
								belly, and away, and then at his throat and over his shoulder one
								way, and go off, and up at it again another way; and with such
								quickness, speed, and violence did it assault him, as if it would
								tear out his throat or his belly. A good while, he was without fear;
								but, at last, I felt my heart to fail and sink under it, that I
								thought my life was going out. And I recovered myself, and gave a
								start up, and ran to the fence, and calling upon God and naming the
								name Jesus Christ, and then it invisibly away. My meaning is, it
								ceased at once; but this deponent made it not known to anybody, for
								fretting his wife.”<note target="v2n8" place="unspecified"

						<p>We are all exposed to the danger of confounding the impressions left by
							the imagination, when, set free from all confinement, it runs wild in
							dreams, with the actual experiences of wakeful faculties in real life.
							It is a topic worthy the consideration of writers on evidence, and of
							legal tribunals. So also is the effect, upon the personal consciousness,
							of the continued <pb n="415" id="vII415"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2428">
								<figDesc>Page 415.</figDesc>

								<figDesc>Page 416.</figDesc>
							</figure> fabrication of falsehood or of fancy has come, at last, to be

						<p>A thorough and philosophical treatise on the subject of evidence is, in
							view of these considerations, much needed. The liability all men are
							under to confound the fictions of their imaginations with the realities
							of actual observation is not understood with sufficient clearness by the
							community; and, so long as it is not understood and regarded, serious
							mistakes and inconveniences will be apt to occur in seasons of general
							excitement. We are still disposed to attribute more importance than we
							ought to strong convictions, without stopping to inquire whether they
							may not be in reality delusions of the understanding. The cause of truth
							demands a more thorough examination of this whole subject. The visions
							that appeared before the mind of the celebrated Colonel Gardiner are
							still regarded by the generality of pious people as evidence of
							miraculous interposition, while, just so far as they are evidence to
							that point, so far is the authority of Christianity overthrown; for it
							is a fact, that Lord Herbert of Cherbury believed with equal sincerity
							and confidence that he had been vouchsafed a similar vision sanctioning
							his labors, when about to publish what has been pronounced one of the

							<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The Deposition of Joseph Bayley,</hi> aged
								forty-four years. — Testifieth and saith, that, on the twenty-fifth
								day of May last, myself and my wife being bound to Boston, on the
								road, when I came in sight of the house where John Procter did live,
								there was a very hard blow struck on my breast, which caused great
								pain in my stomach and amazement in my head, but did see no person
								near me, only my wife behind me on the same horse; and, when I came
								against said Procter's house, according to my understanding, I did
								see John Procter and his wife at said house. Procter himself looked
								out of the window, and his wife did stand just without the door. I
								told my wife of it; and she did look that way, and could see nothing
								but a little maid at <pb n="418" id="vII418"/>
								<figure id="Uphv2431">
									<figDesc>Page 418.</figDesc>
								</figure> the door. Afterwards, about half a mile from the aforesaid
								house, I was taken spechless for some short time. My wife did ask me
								several questions, and desired me, that, if I could not speak, I
								should hold up my hand; which I did, and immediately I could speak
								as well as ever. And, when we came to the way where Salem road
								cometh into Ipswich road, there I received another blow on my
								breast, which caused so much pain that I could not sit on my horse.
								And, when I did alight off my horse, to my understanding, I saw a
								woman coming towards us about sixteen or twenty pole from us, but
								did not know who it was: my wife could not see her. When I did get
								up on my horse again, to my understanding, there stood a cow where I
								saw the woman. After that, we went to Boston without any further
								molestation; but, after I came home again to Newbury, I was pinched
								and nipped by something invisible for some time: but now, through
								God's goodness to me, I am well again. — <hi rend="italics">Jurat in
									curia</hi> by both persons.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>Bayley and his wife were going to Boston on election week. It was a good
							two days' journey from Newbury, as the roads then were, and riding as
							they did. According to the custom of the times, she was mounted on a
							pillion behind him. They had probably passed the night at the house of
							Sergeant Thomas Putnam, with whom he was connected by marriage. It was
							at the height of the witchcraft delirium. Thomas Putnam's house was the
							very focus of it. There they had listened to highly wrought accounts of
							its wonders and terrors, had witnessed the amazing phenomena exhibited
							by Ann Putnam and Mercy Lewis, and their minds been filled with images
							of <pb n="419" id="vII419"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2432">
								<figDesc>Page 419.</figDesc>
							</figure> spectres of living witches, and ghosts of the dead. They had
							seen with their own eyes the tortures of the girls under cruel
							diabolical influence, of which they had heard so much, and realized the
							dread outbreak of Satan and his agents upon the lives and souls of
							men.</p>
						<p>They started the next morning on their way through the gloomy woods and
							over the solitary road. It was known that they were to pass the house of
							John Procter, believed to be a chief resort of devilish spirits.
							Oppressed with terror and awe, Bayley was on the watch, his heart in his
							mouth. The moment he came in sight, his nervous agitation reached its
							climax; and he experienced the shock he describes. When he came opposite
							to the house, to his horror there was Procter looking at him from the
							window, and Procter's wife standing outside of the door. He knew, that,
							in their proper persons and natural bodies, they were, at that moment,
							both of them, and had been for six weeks, in irons, in one of the cells
							of the jail at Boston. Bayley's wife, from her position on the pillion
							behind him, had her face directed to the other side of the road. He told
							her what he saw. She looked round to the house, and could see nothing
							but a little maid at the door. After one or two more fits of fright, he
							reached the Lynn road, had escaped from the infernal terrors of the
							infected region, and his senses resumed their natural functions. It was
							several days before his nervous agitations ceased. Altogether, this is a
							remarkable case of hallucination: <pb n="420" id="vII420"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2433">
								<figDesc>Page 420.</figDesc>
							</figure> showing that the wildest fancies brought before the mind in
							dreams may be paralleled in waking hours; and that mental excitement
							may, even then, close the avenues of the senses, exclude the perception
							of reality, and substitute unsubstantial visions in the place of actual
							and natural objects.</p>
						<p>There may be an interest in some minds to know who the “little maid at
							the door” was. The elder children of John Procter were either married
							off, or lived on his farm at Ipswich, with the exception of Benjamin,
							his oldest son, who remained with his father on the Salem farm. Benjamin
							had been imprisoned two days before Bayley passed the house. Four days
							before, Sarah, sixteen years of age, had also been arrested, and
							committed to jail. This left only William, eighteen years of age, who,
							three days after, was himself put into prison; Samuel, seven; Abigail,
							between three and four years of age; and one still younger. No female of
							the family was then at the house older than Abigail. This poor deserted
							child was “the little maid.” Curiosity to see the passing strangers, or
							possibly the hope that they might be her father and mother, or her
							brother and sister, brought her to the door.</p>
						<p>In the terrible consequences that resulted from the mischievous, and
							perhaps at the outset merely sportive, proceedings of the children in
							Mr. Parris's family, we have a striking illustration of the principle,
							that no one can foretell, with respect either to himself or others, the
							extent of the suffering and injury that may <pb n="421" id="vII421"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2434">
								<figDesc>Page 421.</figDesc>
							</figure> be occasioned by the least departure from truth, or from the
							practice of deception. In the horrible succession of crimes through
							which those young persons were led to pass, in the depth of depravity to
							which they were thrown, we discern the fate that endangers all who enter
							upon a career of wickedness.</p>
						<p>No one can have an adequate knowledge of the human mind, who has not
							contemplated its developments in scenes like those that have now been
							related. It may be said of the frame of our spiritual, even with more
							emphasis than of our corporeal nature, that we are fearfully and
							wonderfully made. In the maturity of his bodily and mental organization,
							health gliding through his veins, strength and symmetry clothing his
							form, intelligence beaming from his countenance, and immortality stamped
							on his brow, man is indeed the noblest work of God. In the degradation
							and corruption to which he can descend, he is the most odious and
							loathsome object in the creation. The human mind, when all its faculties
							are fully developed and in proper proportions, reason seated on its
							rightful throne and shedding abroad its light, memory embracing the
							past, hope smiling upon the future, faith leaning on Heaven, and the
							affections diffusing through all their gentle warmth, is worthy of its
							source, deserves its original title of “image of God,” and is greater
							and better than the whole material universe. It is nobler than all the
							works of God; for it is an emanation, a part of God himself, “a ray from
							the fountain of light.” But where, I <pb n="422" id="vII422"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2435">
								<figDesc>Page 422.</figDesc>
							</figure> ask, can you find a more deplorable and miserable object than
							the mind in ruins, tossed by its own rebellious principles, and
							distorted by the monstrously unequal development of its faculties? You
							will look in vain upon the earthquake, the volcano, or the hurricane,
							for those elements of the awful and terrible which are manifested in a
							community of men whose passions have trampled upon their principles,
							whose imaginations have overthrown the government of reason, and who are
							swept along by the torrent until all order and security are swallowed up
							and lost. Such a spectacle we have now been witnessing. We have seen the
							whole population of this place and vicinity yielding to the sway of
							their credulous fancies, allowing their passions to be worked up to a
							tremendous pitch of excitement, and rushing into excesses of folly and
							violence that have left a stain on their memory, and will awaken a sense
							of shame, pity, and amazement in the minds of their latest
							posterity.</p>
						<p>There is nothing more mysterious than the selfdeluding power of the mind,
							and there never were scenes in which it was more clearly displayed than
							the witchcraft prosecutions. Honest men testified, with perfect
							confidence and sincerity, to the most absurd impossibilities; while
							those who thought themselves victims of diabolical influence would
							actually exhibit, in their corporeal frames, all the appropriate
							symptoms of the sufferings their imaginations had brought upon them.
							Great ignorance prevailed in reference to the influences of the body and
							the mind <pb n="423" id="vII423"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2436">
								<figDesc>Page 423.</figDesc>
							</figure> upon each other. While the imagination was called into a more
							extensive and energetic action than at any succeeding or previous
							period, its properties and laws were but little understood: the extent
							of the connection of the will and the muscular system, the reciprocal
							influence of the nerves and the fancy, and the strong and universally
							pervading sympathy between our physical and moral constitutions, were
							almost wholly unknown. These important subjects, indeed, are but
							imperfectly understood at the present day.</p>
						<p>It may perhaps be affirmed, that the relations of the human mind with the
							spiritual world will never be understood while we continue in the
							present stage of existence and mode of being. The error of our ancestors
							— and it is an error into which men have always been prone to fall, and
							from which our own times are by no means exempt — was in imagining that
							their knowledge had extended, in this direction, beyond the boundary
							fixed unalterably to our researches, while in this corporeal life.</p>
						<p>It admits of much question, whether human science can ever find a solid
							foundation in what relates to the world of spirits. The only instrument
							of knowledge we can here employ is language. Careful thinkers long ago
							came to the conclusion, that it is impossible to frame a language
							precisely and exclusively adapted to convey abstract and spiritual
							ideas, even if it is possible, as some philosophers have denied, for the
							mind, in its present state, to have such ideas. All <pb n="424"
								id="vII424"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2437">
								<figDesc>Page 424.</figDesc>
							</figure> attempts to construct such a language, though made by the most
							ingenious men, have failed. Language is based upon imagery, and
							associations drawn from so much of the world as the senses disclose to
							us; that is, from material objects and their relations. We are here
							confined, as it were, within narrow walls. We can catch only glimpses of
							what is above and around us, outside of those walls. Such glimpses may
							be vouchsafed, from time to time, to rescue us from sinking into
							materialism, and to keep alive our faith in scenes of existence
							remaining to be revealed when the barriers of our imprisonment shall be
							taken down, and what we call death lift us to a clearer and broader
							vision of universal being.</p>
						<p>Of the reality of the spiritual world, we are assured by consciousness
							and by faith; but our knowledge of that world, so far as it can go into
							particulars, or become the subject of definition or expression, extends
							no further than revelation opens the way. In all ages, men have been
							awakened to the “wonders of the invisible world;” but they remain
							“wonders” still. Nothing like a permanent, stable, or distinct science
							has ever been achieved in this department. Man and God are all that are
							placed within our ken. Metaphysics and Theology are the names given to
							the sciences that relate to them. The greater the number of books
							written by human learning and ingenuity to expound them, the more
							advanced the intelligence and piety of mankind, the less, it is
							confessed, do we know of them in detail, the more they rise above our
							comprehension, <pb n="425" id="vII425"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2438">
								<figDesc>Page 425.</figDesc>
							</figure> the more unfathomable become their depths. Experience,
							history, the progress of light, all increase our sense of the
							impossibility of estimating the capacities of the human soul. So also we
							find that the higher we rise towards the Deity, in the contemplation of
							his works and word, the more does he continue to transcend our power to
							describe or imagine his greatness and glory. The revelation which the
							Saviour brought to mankind is all that the heart of man need desire or
							the mind of man can comprehend. We are God's children, and he is our
							Father. That is all; and, the wiser and better we become, the more we
							are convinced and satisfied that it is enough.</p>
						<p>There are, undoubtedly, innumerable beings in the world of spirits,
							besides departed souls, the Redeemer and the Father. But of such beings
							we have, while here, no absolute and specific knowledge. In every age,
							as well as in our own, there have been persons who have believed
							themselves to hold communication with unseen spirits. The methods of
							entering into such communication have been infinitely diversified, from
							the incantations of ancient sorcery to the mediums and rappings of the
							present day. In former periods, particularly where the belief of
							witchcraft prevailed, it was thought that such communications could be
							had only with evil spirits, and, mostly, with the Chief of evil spirits.
							They were accordingly treated as criminal, and made the subject of the
							severest penalties known to the law. In our day, no such penalties are
							attached to the practice of seeking spiritual communications. <pb
								n="426" id="vII426"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2439">
								<figDesc>Page 426.</figDesc>
							</figure> Those who have a fancy for such experiments are allowed to
							amuse themselves in this way without reproach or molestation. It is not
							charged upon them that they are dealing with the Evil One or any of his
							subordinates. They do not imagine such a thing themselves. I have no
							disposition, at any time, in any given case, to dispute the reality of
							the wonderful stories told in reference to such matters. All that I am
							prompted ever to remark is, that, if spirits do come, as is believed, at
							the call of those who seek to put themselves into communication with
							them, there is no evidence, I venture to suggest, that they are good
							spirits. I have never heard of their doing much good, substantially, to
							any one. No important truth has been revealed by them, no discovery been
							made, no science had its field enlarged; no department of knowledge has
							been brought into a clearer light; no great interest has been promoted;
							no movement of human affairs, whether in the action of nations or the
							transactions of men, has been advanced or in any way facilitated; no
							impulse has been given to society, and no elevation to life and
							character. It may be that the air is full of spiritual beings, hovering
							about us; but all experience shows that no benefit can be derived from
							seeking their intervention to share with us the duties or the burdens of
							our present probation. The mischiefs which have flowed from the belief
							that they can operate upon human affairs, and from attempting to have
							dealings with them, have been illustrated in the course of our
							narrative. In this view of the subject, <pb n="427" id="vII427"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2440">
								<figDesc>Page 427.</figDesc>
							</figure> no law is needed to prevent real or pretended communication
							with invisible beings. Enlightened reflection, common sense, natural
							prudence, would seem to be sufficient to keep men from meddling at all
							with practices, or countenancing notions, from which all history
							proclaims that no good has ever come, but incalculable evil flowed.</p>
						<p>For the conduct of life, while here in these bodies, we must confine our
							curiosity to fields of knowledge open to our natural and ordinary
							faculties, and embraced within the limits of the established condition
							of things. Our fathers filled their fancies with the visionary images of
							ghosts, demons, apparitions, and all other supposed forms and shadows of
							the invisible world; lent their ears to marvellous stories of
							communications with spirits; gave to supernatural tales of witchcraft
							and demonology a wondering credence, and allowed them to occupy their
							conversation, speculations, and reveries. They carried a belief of such
							things, and a proneness to indulge it, into their daily life, their
							literature, and the proceedings of tribunals, ecclesiastical and civil.
							The fearful results shrouded their annals in darkness and shame. Let
							those results for ever stand conspicuous, beacon-monuments warning us,
							and coming generations, against superstition in every form, and all
							credulous and vain attempts to penetrate beyond the legitimate
							boundaries of human knowledge.</p>
						<p>The phenomena of the real world, so far as science discloses them to our
							contemplation; the records of <pb n="428" id="vII428"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2441">
								<figDesc>Page 428.</figDesc>
							</figure> actual history; the lessons of our own experience; the
							utterances of the voice within, audible only to ourselves; and the
							teachings of the Divine Word, — are sufficient for the exercise of our
							faculties and the education of our souls during this brief period of our
							being, while in these bodies. In God's appointed time, we shall be
							transferred to a higher level of vision. Then, but not before, we may
							hope for re-union with disembodied spirits, for intercourse with angels,
							and for a nearer and more open communion with all divine beings.</p>
						<p>The principal difference in the methods by which communications were
							believed to be made between mortals and spiritual beings, at the time of
							the witchcraft delusion and now, is this. Then it was chiefly by the
							medium of the eye, but at present by the ear. The “afflicted children”
							professed to have seen and conversed with the ghosts of George
							Burroughs's former wives and of others. They also professed to have seen
							the shapes or appearances of living persons in a disembodied form, or in
							the likeness of some animal or creature. Now it is affirmed by those
							calling themselves Spiritualists, that, by certain rappings or other
							incantations, they can summon into immediate but invisible presence the
							spirits of the departed, hold conferences with them, and draw from them
							information not derivable from any sources of human knowledge. There is
							no essential distinction between the old and the new belief and
							practice. The consequences that resulted from the former would be <pb
								n="429" id="vII429"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2442">
								<figDesc>Page 429.</figDesc>
							</figure> likely to result from the latter, if it should obtain
							universal or general credence, be allowed to mix with judicial
							proceedings, or to any extent affect the rights of person, property, or
							character.</p>
						<p>The “afflicted children” at Salem Village had, by long practice, become
							wonderful adepts in the art of jugglery, and probably of ventriloquism.
							They did many extraordinary things, and were believed to have constant
							communications with ghosts and spectres; but they did not attain to
							spiritual rapping. If they had possessed that power, the credulity of
							judges, ministers, magistrates, and people, would have been utterly
							overwhelmed, and no limit could have been put to the destruction they
							might have wrought.</p>
						<p>If there was any thing supernatural in the witchcraft of 1692, if any
							other than human spirits were concerned at all, one thing is beyond a
							doubt: they were shockingly wicked spirits, and led those who dealt with
							them to the utmost delusion, crime, and perdition; and this example
							teaches all who seek to consult with spirits, through a medium or in any
							other way, to be very strict to require beforehand the most satisfactory
							and conclusive evidence of good character before they put themselves
							into communication with them. Spirits who are said to converse with
							people, in these modern ages, cannot be considered as having much claim
							to a good repute. No valuable discovery of truth, no important guidance
							in human conduct, no useful instruction, has ever been conveyed to
							mankind through them; and much <pb n="430" id="vII430"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2443">
								<figDesc>Page 430.</figDesc>
							</figure> mischief perhaps may have resulted from confiding in them. It
							is not wise to place our minds under the influence of any of our
							fellow-creatures, in the ordinary guise of humanity, unless we know
							something about them entitling them to our acquaintance; much less so,
							to take them into our intimacy or confidence. Spirits cannot be put
							under oath, or their credibility be subjected to tests. Whether they are
							spirits of truth or falsehood cannot be known; and common caution would
							seem to dictate an avoidance of their company. The fields of knowledge
							opened to us in the works of mortal men; the stores of human learning
							and science; the pages of history, sacred or profane; the records of
							revelation; and the instructions and conversation of the wise and good
							of our fellow, while in the body, — are wide enough for our exploration,
							and may well occupy the longest lifetime.</p>
						<p>In its general outlines and minuter details, Salem Witchcraft is an
							illustration of the fatal effects of allowing the imagination inflamed
							by passion to take the place of common sense, and of pushing the
							curiosity and credence of the human mind, in this stage of our being,
							while in these corporeal embodiments, beyond the boundaries that ought
							to limit their exercise. If we disregard those boundaries, and try to
							overleap them, we shall be liable to the same results. The lesson needs
							to be impressed equally upon all generations and ages of the world's
							future history. Essays have been written and books published to prove
							that the sense of the miraculous is destined <pb n="431" id="vII431"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2444">
								<figDesc>Page 431.</figDesc>
							</figure> to decline as mankind becomes more enlightened, and ascribing
							a greater or less tendency to the indulgence of this sense to particular
							periods of the church, or systems of belief, or schools of what is
							called philosophy. It is maintained that it was more prevalent in the
							mediæval ages than in modern times. Some assert that it has had a
							greater development in Catholic than Protestant countries; and some,
							perhaps, insist upon the reverse. Some attempt to show that it has
							manifested itself more remarkably among Puritans than in other classes
							of Protestant Christians. The last and most pretentious form of this
							dogma is, that the sense of the miraculous fades away in the progress of
							what arrogates to itself the name of Rationalism. This is one of the
							delusive results of introducing generalization into historical
							disquisitions. History deals with man. Man is always the same. The race
							consists, not of an aggregation, but of individuals, in all ages, never
							moulded or melted into classes. Each individual has ever retained his
							distinctness from every other. There has been the same infinite variety
							in every period, in every race, in every nation. Society, philosophy,
							custom, can no more obliterate these varieties than they can bring the
							countenances and features of men into uniformity. Diversity everywhere
							alike prevails. The particular forms and shapes in which the sense of
							the miraculous may express itself have passed and will pass away in the
							progress of civilization. But the sense itself remains; just as
							particular costumes and fashions of garment pass away, while the <pb
								n="432" id="vII432"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2445">
								<figDesc>Page 432.</figDesc>
							</figure> human form, its front erect and its vision towards the
							heavens, remains. The sense of the miraculous remains with Protestants
							as much as with Catholics, with Churchmen as much as with Puritans, with
							those who reject all creeds, equally with those whose creeds are the
							longest and the oldest. In our day, it must have been generally noticed,
							that the wonders of what imagines itself to be Spiritualism are rather
							more accredited by persons who aspire to the character of rationalists
							than by those who hold on tenaciously to the old landmarks of
							Orthodoxy.</p>
						<p>The truth is, that the sense of the miraculous has not declined, and
							never can. It will grow deeper and stronger with the progress of true
							intelligence. As long as man thinks, he will feel that he is himself a
							perpetual miracle. The more he thinks, the more will he feel it. The
							mind which can wander into the deepest depths of the starry heavens, and
							feel itself to be there; which, pondering over the printed page, lives
							in the most distant past, communes with sages of hoar antiquity, with
							prophets and apostles, joins the disciples as they walk with the risen
							Lord to Emmaus, or mingles in the throng that listen to Paul at Mars'
							Hill, — knows itself to be beyond the power of space or time, and
							greater than material things. It knows not what it shall be; but it
							feels that it is something above the present and visible. It realizes
							the spiritual world, and will do so more and more, the higher its
							culture, the greater its freedom, and the wider its view of the material
							nature <pb n="433" id="vII433"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2446">
								<figDesc>Page 433.</figDesc>
							</figure> by which it is environed, while in this transitory stage of
							its history.</p>
						<p>The lesson of our story will be found not to discard spiritual things,
							but to teach us, while in the flesh, not to attempt to break through
							present limitations, not to seek to know more than has been made known
							of the unseen and invisible, but to keep the inquiries of our minds and
							the action of society within the bounds of knowledge now attainable, and
							extend our curious researches and speculations only as far as we can
							here have solid ground to stand upon.</p>
						<p>To explain the superstitious opinions that took effect in the witchcraft
							delusion, it is necessary to consider the state of biblical criticism at
							that period. That department of theological learning was then in a very
							immature condition.</p>
						<p>The authority of Scripture, as it appeared on the face of the standard
							version, seemed to require them to pursue the course they adopted; and
							those enlarged and just principles of interpretation which we are taught
							by the learned of all denominations at the present day to apply to the
							Sacred Writings had not then been brought to the view of the people or
							received by the clergy.</p>
						<p>It was gravely argued, for instance, that there was nothing improbable in
							the idea that witches had the power, in virtue of their compact with the
							Devil, of riding aloft through the air, because it is recorded, in the
							history of our Lord's temptation, that Satan transported him in a
							similar manner to the pinnacle of the <pb n="434" id="vII434"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2447">
								<figDesc>Page 434.</figDesc>
							</figure> temple, and to the summit of an exceedingly high mountain. And
							Cotton Mather declares, that, to his apprehension, the disclosures of
							the wonderful operations of the Devil, upon and through his subjects,
							that were made in the course of the witchcraft prosecutions, had shed a
							marvellous light upon the Scriptures! What a perversion of the Sacred
							Writings to employ them for the purpose of sanctioning the extravagant
							and delirious reveries of the human imagination! What a miserable
							delusion, to suppose that the Word of God could receive illumination
							from the most absurd and horrible superstition that ever brooded in
							darkness over the mind of man!</p>
						<p>One of the sources of the delusion of 1692 was ignorance of many natural
							laws that have been revealed by modern science. A vast amount of
							knowledge on these subjects has been attained since that time. In our
							halls of education, in associations for the diffusion of knowledge, and
							in a diversified and all-pervading popular literature, what was dark and
							impenetrable mystery then has been explained, accounted for, and brought
							within the grasp of all minds. The contemplation of the evils brought
							upon our predecessors by their ignorance of the laws of nature cannot
							but lead us to appreciate more highly our opportunities to get knowledge
							in this department: As we advance into the interior of the physical
							system to which we belong; are led in succession from one revelation of
							beauty and grandeur to another, and the field of light and truth
							displaces that of darkness and <pb n="435" id="vII435"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2448">
								<figDesc>Page 435.</figDesc>
							</figure> mystery; while the fearful images that disturbed the faith and
							bewildered the thoughts of our fathers are dissolving and vanishing, the
							whole host of spirits, ghosts, and demons disappearing, and the presence
							and providence of God alone found to fill all scenes and cause all
							effects, — our hearts ought to rise to him in loftier adoration and
							holier devotion. If, while we enjoy a fuller revelation of his infinite
							and all-glorious operations and designs than our fathers did, the
							sentiment of piety which glowed in their hearts like a coal from the
							altar of God has been permitted to grow dim in ours, no reproach their
							errors and faults can possibly authorize will equal that which will
							justly fall upon us.</p>
						<p>Another cause of their delusion was too great a dependence upon the
							imagination. We shall find no lesson more clearly taught by history, by
							experience, or by observation, than this, that man is never safe while
							either his fancy or his feeling is the guiding principle of his nature.
							There is a strong and constant attraction between his imagination and
							his passions; and, if either is permitted to exercise unlimited sway,
							the other will most certainly be drawn into co with it, and, when they
							are allowed to act without restraint upon each other and with each
							other, they lead to the derangement and convulsion of his whole system.
							They constitute the combustible elements of our being: one serves as the
							spark to explode the other. Reason, enlightened by revelation and guided
							by conscience, is the great conservative principle: <pb n="436"
								id="vII436"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2449">
								<figDesc>Page 436.</figDesc>
							</figure> while that exercises the sovereign power over the fancy and
							the passions, we are safe; if it is dethroned, no limit can be assigned
							to the ruin that may follow. In the scenes we have now been called to
							witness, we have perceived to what lengths of folly, cruelty, and crime
							even good men have been carried, who relinquished the aid, rejected the
							counsels, and abandoned the guidance of their reason.</p>
						<p>Another influence that operated to produce the catastrophe in 1692 was
							the power of contagious sympathy. Every wise man and good citizen ought
							to be aware of the existence and operation of this power. There seems
							indeed to be a constitutional, original, sympathy in our nature. When
							men act in a crowd, their heartstrings are prone to vibrate in unison.
							Whatever chord of passion is struck in one breast, the same will ring
							forth its wild note through the whole mass. This principle shows itself
							particularly in seasons of excitement, and its power rises in proportion
							to the ardor and zeal of those upon whom it acts. It is for every one
							who desires to be preserved from the excesses of popular feeling, and to
							prevent the community to which he belongs from plunging into riotous and
							blind commotions, to keep his own judgment and emotions as free as
							possible from a power that seizes all it can reach, draws them into its
							current, and sweeps them round and round like the Maelstrom, until they
							are overwhelmed and buried in its devouring vortex. When others are
							heated, the only wisdom is to determine to keep cool; whenever a people
							or an individual <pb n="437" id="vII437"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2450">
								<figDesc>Page 437.</figDesc>
							</figure> is rushing headlong, it is the duty of patriotism and of
							friendship to check the motion.</p>
						<p>In this connection it may be remarked — and I should be sorry to bring
							the subject to a close without urging the thought upon your attention —
							that the mere power of sympathy, the momentum with which men act in a
							crowd, is itself capable of convulsing society and overthrowing all its
							safeguards, without the aid or supposed agency of supernatural beings.
							The early history of the colony of New York presents a case in
							point.</p>
						<p>In 1741, just half a century after the witchcraft prosecutions in
							Massachusetts, the city of New York, then containing about nine thousand
							inhabitants, witnessed a scene quite rivalling, in horror and folly,
							that presented here. Some one started the idea, that a conspiracy was on
							foot, among the colored portion of the inhabitants, to murder the
							whites. The story was passed from one to another. Although subsequently
							ascertained to have been utterly without foundation, no one stopped to
							inquire into its truth, or had the wisdom or courage to discountenance
							its circulation. Soon a universal panic, like a conflagration, spread
							through the whole community; and the results were most frightful. More
							than one hundred persons were cast into prison. Four white persons and
							eighteen negroes were hanged. Eleven negroes were burned at the stake,
							and fifty were transported into slavery. As in the witchcraft
							prosecutions, a clergyman was among the victims, and perished on the
							gallows.</p>
						<pb n="438" id="vII438"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2451">
								<figDesc>Page 438.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>The “New-York Negro Plot,” as it was called, was indeed marked by all the
							features of absurdity in the delusion, ferocity in the popular
							excitement, and destruction along the path of its progress, which
							belonged to the witchcraft proceedings here, and shows that any people,
							given over to the power of contagious passion, may be swept by
							desolation, and plunged into ruin.</p>
						<p>One of the practical lessons inculcated by the history that has now been
							related is, that no duty is more certain, none more important, than a
							free and fearless expression of opinion, by all persons, on all
							occasions. No wise or philosophic person would think of complaining of
							the diversities of sentiment it is likely to develop. Such diversities
							are the vital principle of free communities, and the only elements of
							popular intelligence. If the right to utter them is asserted by all and
							for all, tolerance is secured, and no inconvenience results. It is
							probable that there were many persons here in 1692 who doubted the
							propriety of the proceedings at their commencement, but who were
							afterwards prevailed upon to fall into the current and swell the tide.
							If they had all discharged their duty to their country and their
							consciences by freely and boldly uttering their disapprobation and
							declaring their dissent, who can tell but that the whole tragedy might
							have been prevented? and, if it might, the blood of the innocent may be
							said, in one sense, to be upon their heads.</p>
						<p>The leading features and most striking aspects of <pb n="439" id="vII439"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2452">
								<figDesc>Page 439.</figDesc>
							</figure> the witchcraft delusion have been repeated in places where
							witches and the interference of supernatural beings are never thought
							of: whenever a community gives way to its passions, and spurns the
							admonitions and casts off the restraints of reason, there is a delusion
							that can hardly be described in any other phrase. We cannot glance our
							eye over the face of our country without beholding such scenes: and, so
							long as they are exhibited; so long as we permit ourselves to invest
							objects of little or no real importance with such an inordinate
							imaginary interest that we are ready to go to every extremity rather
							than relinquish them; so long as we yield to the impulse of passion, and
							plunge into excitement, and take counsel of our feelings rather than our
							judgment, — we are following in the footsteps of our fanatical
							ancestors. It would be wiser to direct our ridicule and reproaches to
							the delusions of our own times than to those of a previous age; and it
							becomes us to treat with charity and mercy the failings of our
							predecessors, at least until we have ceased to imitate and repeat
							them.</p>
						<p>It has been my object to collect and arrange all the materials within
							reach necessary to give a correct and adequate view of the passage of
							history related and discussed in this work, and to suggest the
							considerations and conclusions required by truth and justice. It is
							worthy of the most thoughtful contemplation. The moralist,
							metaphysician, and political philosopher will find few chapters of human
							experience more fraught with instruction, and may well ponder upon <pb
								n="440" id="vII440"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2453">
								<figDesc>Page 440.</figDesc>
							</figure> the lessons it teaches, scrutinize thoroughly all its periods,
							phases, and branches, analyze its causes, eliminate its elements, and
							mark its developments. The laws, energies, capabilities, and liabilities
							of our nature, as exhibited in the character of individuals and in the
							action of society, are remarkably illustrated. The essential facts
							belonging to the transaction, gathered from authentic records and
							reliable testimonies and traditions, have been faithfully presented. <hi
								rend="smallcaps">The Witchcraft Delusion of</hi> 1692, so far as I
							have been able to recover it from misunderstanding and oblivion, has
							been brought to view; and I indulge the belief, that the subject will
							commend itself to, and reward, the study of every meditative mind.</p>
						<p>I know not in what better terms the discussion of this subject can be
							brought to a termination, than in those which express the conclusions to
							which one of our own most distinguished citizens was brought, after
							having examined the whole transaction with the eye of a lawyer and the
							spirit of a judge. The following is from the Centennial Discourse
							pronounced in Salem on the 18th of September, 1828, by the late Hon.
							Joseph Story, of the Supreme Court of the United States: —</p>
						<p>“We may lament, then,” says he, “the errors of the times, which led to
							these prosecutions. But surely our ancestors had no special reasons for
							shame in a belief which had the universal sanction of their own and all
							former ages; which counted in its train philosophers, as well as
							enthusiasts; which was graced <pb n="441" id="vII441"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2454">
								<figDesc>Page 441.</figDesc>
							</figure> by the learning of prelates, as well as by the countenance of
							kings; which the law supported by its mandates, and the purest judges
							felt no compunctions in enforcing. Let Witch Hill remain for ever
							memorable by this sad catastrophe, not to perpetuate our dishonor, but
							as an affecting, enduring proof of human infirmity; a proof that perfect
							justice belongs to one judgment only, — that which is linked to the
							throne of God.”</p>
						<p>In the work which has now reached its close, many strange phases of
							humanity have been exposed. We have beheld, with astonishment and
							horror, the extent to which it is liable to be the agent and victim of
							delusion and ruin. Folly that cannot be exceeded; wrong, outrage, and
							woe, melting the heart that contemplates them; and crime, not within our
							power or province to measure, — have passed before us. But not the dark
							side only of our nature has been displayed. Manifestations of innocence,
							heroism, invincible devotion to truth, integrity of soul triumphing over
							all the terrors and horrors that can be accumulated in life and in
							death, Christian piety in its most heavenly radiance, have mingled in
							the drama, whose curtain is now to fall. Noble specimens of virtue in
							man and woman, old and young, have shed a light, as from above, upon its
							dark and melancholy scenes. Not only the sufferers, but some of those
							who shared the dread responsibility of the crisis, demand our
							commiseration, and did what they could to atone for their error.</p>
						<p>The conduct of Judge Sewall claims our particular <pb n="442" id="vII442"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2455">
								<figDesc>Page 442.</figDesc>
							</figure> admiration. He observed annually in private a day of
							humiliation and prayer, during the remainder of his life, to keep fresh
							in his mind a sense of repentance and sorrow for the part he bore in the
							trials. On the day of the general fast, he rose in the place where he
							was accustomed to worship, the Old South, in Boston, and, in the
							presence of the great assembly, handed up to the pulpit a written
							confession, acknowledging the error into which he had been led, praying
							for the forgiveness of God and his people, and concluding with a request
							to all the congregation to unite with him in devout supplication, that
							it might not bring down the displeasure of the Most High upon his
							country, his family, or himself. He remained standing during the public
							reading of the paper. This was an act of true manliness and dignity of
							soul.</p>
						<p>The following passage is found in his diary, under the date of April 23,
							1720, nearly thirty years afterwards. It was suggested by the perusal of
							Neal's “History of New England:” —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“In Dr. Neal's `History of New England,' its nakedness is laid open
								in the businesses of the Quakers, Anabaptists, witchcraft. The
								judges' names are mentioned p. 502; my confession, p. 536, vol. ii.
								The good and gracious God be pleased to save New England and me, and
								my family!”</p>
						</q>
						<p>There never was a more striking and complete fulfilment of the apostolic
							assurance, that the prayer of a righteous man availeth much, than in
							this instance. God has been pleased, in a remarkable manner, to <pb
								n="443" id="vII443"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2456">
								<figDesc>Page 443.</figDesc>
							</figure> save and bless New England. The favor of Heaven was bestowed
							upon Judge Sewall during the remainder of his life. He presided for many
							years on the bench where he committed the error so sincerely deplored by
							him, and was regarded by all as a benefactor, an ornament, and a
							blessing to the community: while his family have enjoyed to a high
							degree the protection of Providence from that day to this; have adorned
							every profession, and every department of society; have filled with
							honor the most elevated stations; have graced, in successive
							generations, the same lofty seat their ancestor occupied; and been the
							objects of the confidence, respect, and love of their fellow.</p>
						<p>Your thoughts have been led through scenes of the most distressing and
							revolting character. I leave before your imaginations one bright with
							all the beauty of Christian virtue, — that which exhibits Judge Sewall
							standing forth in the house of his God and in the presence of his
							fellow-worshippers, making a public declaration of his sorrow and regret
							for the mistaken judgment he had co-operated with others in pronouncing.
							Here you have a representation of a truly great and magnanimous spirit;
							a spirit to which the divine influence of our religion had given an
							expansion and a lustre that Roman or Grecian virtue never knew; a spirit
							that had achieved a greater victory than warrior ever won, — a victory
							over itself; a spirit so noble and so pure, that it felt no shame in
							acknowledging an error, and publicly imploring, <pb n="444" id="vII444"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2457">
								<figDesc>Page 444.</figDesc>
							</figure> for a great wrong done to his fellow-creatures, the
							forgiveness of God and man.</p>
						<p>Our Essex poet, whose beautiful genius has made classical the banks of
							his own Merrimac, shed a romantic light over the early homes and

							<p>When Edward Bishop and his wife Sarah were arrested, household goods
								which were valued by the sheriff himself at ten pounds, — he
								refusing that sum for their restitution, — six cows, twenty-four
								swine, forty-six sheep, were taken from his farm. The imprisonment
								of himself and wife (prior to their escape) aggregated thirty-seven
								weeks. Ten shillings a week for board, and other charges and prison
								fees amounting to five pounds, were assessed upon his estate, and
								taken by distraint. A family of twelve children was left without any
								to direct or care for them, and the product of the farm for that
								year wholly cut off.</p>
							<p>There were taken from the estate of Samuel Wardwell, who was
								executed, five cows, a heifer and yearling, a horse, nine hogs,
								eight loads of hay, six acres of standing corn, and a set of
								carpenters' tools. From the estate of Dorcas Hoar, a widow, there
								were taken two cows, an ox and mare, four pigs, bed, bed-curtains
								and bedding, and other household stuff.</p>
							<p>Persons apprehended were made to pay all charges of every kind for
								their maintenance, fuel, clothes, expenses of transportation from
								jail to jail, and inexorable court and prison fees. The usual fee to
								the clerk of the courts was ¥1. 17<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 5<hi

								fee. When discharged, there was a fee. The expenses of the
								executions, even hangmen's fees, were levied on the families of the
								sufferers. Abraham Foster, whose mother died in prison, to get her
								body for burial, had to pay ¥2. 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi></p>
							<p>When the value of money at that time is considered, and we bear in

								other depositions in these cases, that may perhaps be explained
								under the head of nightmare. The following are specimens; that, for
								instance, of Robert Downer, of Salisbury, who testifies and says,
								—</p>
							<q direct="unspecified">
								<p>“That, several years ago, Susanna Martin, the then wife of George
									Martin, being brought to court for a witch, the said Downer,
									having some words with her, this deponent, among other things,
									told her he believed that she was a witch, by what was said or
									witnessed against her; at which she, seeming not well affected,
									said that a, or some, she-devil would fetch him away shortly, at
									which this deponent was not much moved; but at night, as he lay
									in his bed in his own house, alone, there came at his window the
									likeness of a cat, and by and by came up to his bed, took fast
									hold of his throat, and lay hard upon him a considerable while,
									and was like to throttle him. At length, he minded what Susanna
									Martin threatened him with the day before. he strove what he
									could, and said, `Avoid, thou she-devil, in the name of the
									Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost!' and then it let him
									go, and jumped down upon the floor, and went out at the window
									again.”</p>
							</q>
							<p>Susanna Martin, by the boldness and severity of her language, in
								defending herself against the charge of witchcraft, had evidently,
								for a long time, rendered herself an object of dread, and seems to
								have disturbed the dreams of the superstitious throughout the
								neighborhood. For instance, Jarvis Ring, of Salisbury, made oath as
								follows: —</p>
							<q direct="unspecified">
								<p>“That, about seven or eight years ago, he had been several times
									afflicted, in the night-time, by some body or some thing coming
									up upon him when he was in bed, and did sorely afflict him by
									lying upon him; and he could neither move nor speak while it was
									upon him, but sometimes made a kind of noise that folks did hear
									him and come up to him; and, as soon as anybody came, it would
									be gone. This it did for a long time, both then and since, but
									he did never see anybody clearly; but one time, in the night, it
									came upon me as at other times, and I did then see the person of
									Susanna Martin, of Amesbury. I, this deponent, did perfectly see
									her; and she came to this deponent, and took him by the hand,
									and bit him by the finger by force, and then came and lay upon
									him awhile, as formerly, and after a while went away. The print
									of the bite is yet to be seen on the little finger of his right
									hand; for it was hard to heal. He further saith, that several
									times he was asleep when it came; but, at that time, he was as
									fairly awaked as ever he was, and plainly saw her shape, and
									felt her teeth, as aforesaid.”</p>
							</q>
							<p>Barnard Peach made oath substantially as follows: —</p>
							<q direct="unspecified">
								<p>“That about six or seven years past, being in bed on a Lord's-day
									night, he heard a scrambling at the window, and saw Susanna
									Martin come in at the window, and jump down upon the floor. She
									was in her hood and scarf, and the same dress that she was in
									before, at meeting the same day. Being come in, she was coming
									up towards this deponent's face, but turned back to his feet,
									and took hold of them, and drew up his body into a heap, and lay
									upon him about an hour and a half or two hours, in all which
									time this deponent could not stir nor speak; but, feeling
									himself beginning to be loosened or lightened, and he beginning
									to strive, he put out his hand among the clothes, and took hold
									of her hand, and brought it up to his mouth, and bit three of
									the fingers (as he judges) to the breaking of the bones; which
									done, the said Martin went out of the chamber, down the stairs,
									and out of the door. The deponent further declared, that, on
									another Lord's-day night, while sleeping on the hay in a barn,
									about midnight the said Susanna Martin and another came out of
									the shop into the barn, and one of them said, `Here he is,' and
									then came towards this deponent. He, having a quarterstaff, made
									a blow at them; but the roof of the barn prevented it, and they
									went away: but this deponent followed them, and, as they were
									going towards the window, made another blow at them, and struck
									them both down; but away they went out at the shop-window, and
									this deponent saw no more of them. And the rumor went, that the
									said Martin had a broken head at that time; but the deponent
									cannot speak to that upon his own knowledge.”</p>

					<p>[The subject of Salem Witchcraft has been traced to its conclusion, and
						discussed within its proper limits, in the foregoing work. But whoever is
						interested in it as a chapter of history or an exhibition of humanity may
						feel a curiosity, on some points, that reasonably demands gratification. The
						questions will naturally arise, Who were the earliest to extricate
						themselves and the public from the delusion? what is known, beyond the facts
						mentioned in the progress of the foregoing discussion, of the later fortunes
						of its prominent actors? what the-view taken in the retrospect by
						individuals and public bodies implicated in the transaction? and what
						opinions on the general subject have subsequently prevailed? To answer these
						questions is the design of this Supplement.]</p>
					<p>It can hardly be said that there was any open and avowed opposition in the
						community to the proceedings during their early progress. There is some
						uncertainty and obscurity to what extent there was an unexpressed dissent in
						the minds of particular private persons. On the general subject of the
						existence and power of the Devil and his agency, more or less, in
						influencing human and earthly affairs, it would be difficult to prove that
						there was any considerable difference of opinion.</p>
					<p>The first undisguised and unequivocal opposition to the proceedings was a
						remarkable document that has recently come to light. Among some papers which
						have found their way to the custody of the Essex Institute, is a letter,
						dated “Salisbury, Aug. 9, 1692,” addressed “To the worshipful Jonathan
						Corwin, Esq., these present at his house in Salem.” It is indorsed, “A
						letter <pb n="448" id="vII448"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2461">
							<figDesc>Page 448.</figDesc>
						</figure> to my grandfather, on account of the condemnation of the witches.”
						Its date shows that it was written while the public infatuation and fury
						were at their height, and the Court was sentencing to death and sending to
						the gallows its successive cartloads. There is no injunction of secresy, and
						no shrinking from responsibility. Although the name of the writer is not
						given in full, he was evidently well known to Corwin, and had written to him
						before on the subject. The messenger, in accordance with the superscription,
						undoubtedly delivered it into the hands of the judge at his residence on the
						corner of Essex and North Streets. The fact that Jonathan Corwin preserved
						this document, and placed it in the permanent files of his family papers, is
						pretty good proof that he appreciated the weight of its arguments. It is not
						improbable that he expressed himself to that effect to his brethren on the
						bench, and perhaps to others. What he said, and the fact that he was holding
						such a correspondence, may have reached the ears of the accusers, and led
						them to commence a movement against him by crying out upon his
						mother-in-law.</p>
					<p>The letter is a most able argument against the manner in which the trials
						were conducted, and, by conclusive logic, overthrows the whole fabric of the
						evidence on the strength of which the Court was convicting and taking the
						lives of innocent persons. No such piece of reasoning has come to us from
						that age. Its author must be acknowledged to have been an expert in
						dialectic subtleties, and a pure reasoner of unsurpassed acumen and force.
						It requires, but it will reward, the closest attention and concentration of
						thought in following the threads of the argument. It reaches its conclusions
						on a most difficult subject with clearness and certainty. It achieves and
						realizes, in mere mental processes, quantities, and forces, on the points at
						which it aims, what is called demonstration in mathematics and geometry.</p>
					<p>The writer does not discredit, but seems to have received, the then prevalent
						doctrines relating to the personality, power, and attributes of the Devil;
						and, from that standpoint, controverts and demolishes the principles on
						which the Court was proceeding, in reference to the “spectral evidence” and
						the credibility of the “afflicted children” generally. The letter, and the
						formal argument appended to it, arrest notice in one or two general aspects.
						There is an appearance of their having proceeded from an elderly <pb n="449"
							id="vII449"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2462">
							<figDesc>Page 449.</figDesc>
						</figure> person, not at all from any marks of infirmity of intellect, but
						rather from an air of wisdom and a tone of authority which can only result
						from long experience and observation. The circumstance that an amanuensis
						was employed, and the author writes the initials of his signature only,
						strengthens this impression. At the same time, there are indications of a
						free and progressive spirit, more likely to have had force at an earlier
						period of life. In some aspects, the document indicates a theological
						education, and familiarity with matters that belong to the studies of a
						minister; in others, it manifests habits of mind and modes of expression and
						reasoning more natural to one accustomed to close legal statements and
						deductions. If the production of a trained professional man of either class,
						it would justly be regarded as remarkable. If its author belonged to neither
						class, but was merely a local magistrate, farmer, and militia officer, it
						becomes more than remarkable. There must have been a high development among
						the founders of our villages, when the laity could present examples of such
						a capacity to grasp the most difficult subjects, and conduct such acute and
						abstruse disquisitions. [See Appendix.]</p>
					<p>The question as to the authorship of this paper may well excite interest,
						involving, as it does, minute critical speculations. The elements that enter
						into its solution illustrate the difficulties and perplexities encompassing
						the study of local antiquities, and attempts to determine the origin and
						bearings of old documents or to settle minute points of history. The weight
						of evidence seems to indicate that the document is attributable to Major
						Robert Pike, of Salisbury. Whoever was its author did his duty nobly, and
						stands alone, above all the scholars and educated men of the time, in
						bearing testimony openly, bravely, in the very ears of the Court, against
						the disgraceful and shocking course they were pursuing.<note target="v2n9"

					<p>William Brattle, an eminent citizen and opulent merchant of Boston, and a
						gentleman of education and uncommon abilities, wrote a letter to an unknown
						correspondent of the clerical profession, <pb n="451" id="vII451"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2464">
							<figDesc>Page 451.</figDesc>
						</figure> in October, 1692. It is an able criticism upon the methods of
						procedure at the trials, condemning them in the strongest language; but it
						was a confidential communication, and not published <pb n="452" id="vII452"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2465">
							<figDesc>Page 452.</figDesc>
						</figure> until many years afterwards. He says that “the witches' meetings,
						the Devil's baptisms and mock sacraments, which the accusing and confessing
						witches oft speak of, are nothing else but the effect of their fancy,
						depraved and deluded by the Devil, and not a reality to be regarded or
						minded by any wise man.” He charges the judges with having taken testimony
						from the Devil himself, through witnesses who swore to what they said the
						Devil communicated to them, thus indirectly introducing the Devil as a
						witness; and he clinches the accusation by quoting the judges themselves,
						who, when the accusing and confessing witnesses contradicted each other, got
						over the difficulty by saying that the Devil, in such instances, took away
						the memory of some of them, for the moment, obscuring their brains, and
						misleading them. He sums up this part of his reasoning in these words: “If
						it be thus granted that the Devil is able to represent false ideas to the
						imaginations of the confessors, what man of sense will regard the
						confessions, or any of the words of these confessors?” He says that he knows
						several persons “about the Bay,” — men, for understanding, judgment, and
						piety, inferior to few, if any, in New England, — that do utterly condemn
						the said proceedings. He repudiates the idea that Salem was, in any sense,
						exclusively responsible for the transaction; and affirms that “other
						justices in the country, besides the Salem justices, <pb n="453" id="vII453"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2466">
							<figDesc>Page 453.</figDesc>
						</figure> have issued out their warrants;” and states, that, of the eight
						“judges, commissioned for this Court at Salem, five do belong to Suffolk
						County, four of which five do belong to Boston, and therefore I see no
						reason why Boston should talk of Salem as though their own judges had had no
						hand in these proceedings in Salem.”</p>
					<p>There is one view of the subject, upon which Brattle presses with much force
						and severity. There is ground to suspect, that the proceedings were suffered
						to go on after some of those appearing to countenance them had ceased to
						have faith in the accusations. He charges, directly, complicity in the
						escape of Mrs. Carey, Mrs. English, Captain Alden, Hezekiah Usher, and
						others, upon the high officials; and says that while the evidence, upon
						which so many had been imprisoned, sentenced, and executed, bore against
						Mrs. Thacher, of Boston, she was never proceeded against. “She was much
						complained of by the afflicted persons, and yet the justices would not issue
						out their warrants to apprehend” her and certain others; while at the very
						same time they were issuing, upon no better or other grounds, warrants
						against so many others. He charges the judges with this most criminal
						favoritism. The facts hardly justify such an imputation upon the judges.
						They did not, after the trials had begun, it is probable, ever issue
						warrants: that was the function of magistrates. With the exception, perhaps,
						of Corwin, I think there is no evidence of there having been any doubts or
						misgivings on the bench. It is altogether too heavy a charge to bring,
						without the strongest evidence, upon any one. To intimate that officials, or
						any persons, who did not believe in the accusations, connived at the escape
						of their friends and relatives, and at the same time countenanced, pretended
						to believe, and gave deadly effect to them when directed against others, is
						supposing a criminality and baseness too great to be readily admitted. In
						that wild reign of the worst of passions, this would have transcended them
						all in its iniquity. The only excusable people at that time were those who
						honestly, and without a doubt, believed in the guilt of the convicted. Those
						who had doubts, and did not frankly and fearlessly express them, were the
						guilty ones. On their hands is the stain of the innocent blood that was
						shed. It is not probable, and is scarcely possible, that any considerable
						number could be at once doubters and prosecutors. On this <pb n="454"
							id="vII454"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2467">
							<figDesc>Page 454.</figDesc>
						</figure> point, Brattle must be understood to mean, not that judges, or
						others actively engaged in the prosecutions, warded off proceedings against
						particular friends or relatives from a principle of deliberate favoritism,
						but that third parties, actuated by a sycophantic spirit, endeavored to hush
						up or intercept complaints, when directed too near to the high officials, or
						thought to gain their favor by aiding the escape of persons in whom they
						were interested.</p>
					<p>Brattle uses the same weapon which afterwards the opponents of Mr. Parris, in
						his church at Salem Village, wielded with such decisive effect against him
						and all who abetted him. It is much to be lamented, that, instead of hiding
						it under a confidential letter, he did not at the time openly bring it to
						bear in the most public and defiant manner. One brave, strong voice, uttered
						in the face of the court and in the congregations of the people, echoed from
						the corners of the streets, and reaching the ears of the governor and
						magistrates, denouncing the entire proceedings as the damnable crime of
						familiarity with evil spirits, and sorcery of the blackest dye, might
						perhaps have recalled the judges, the people, and the rulers to their
						senses. If the spirit of the ancient prophets of God, of the Quakers of the
						preceding age, or of true reformers of any age, had existed in any breast,
						the experiment would have been tried. Brattle says, —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“I cannot but admire that any should go with their distempered friends
							and relations to the afflicted children, to know what their distempered
							friends ail, whether they are not bewitched, who it is that afflicts
							them, and the like. It is true, I know no reason why these afflicted may
							not be consulted as well as any other, if so be that it was only their
							natural and ordinary knowledge that was had recourse to: but it is not
							on this notion that these afflicted children are sought unto, but as
							they have a supernatural knowledge; a knowledge which they obtain by
							their holding correspondence with spectres or evil spirits, as they
							themselves grant. This consulting of these afflicted children, as
							abovesaid, seems to me to be a very gross evil, a real abomination, not
							fit to be known in New England; and yet is a thing practised, not only
							by <hi rend="italics">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italics">John,</hi> — I
							mean the rude and more ignorant sort, — but by many who profess high,
							and pass among us for some of the better sort. This is that which
							aggravates the evil, and makes it heinous and tremendous; and yet this
							is not the worst of it, — for, as <pb n="455" id="vII455"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2468">
								<figDesc>Page 455.</figDesc>
							</figure> sure as I now write to you, even some of our civil leaders and
							spiritual teachers, who, I think, should punish and preach down such
							sorcery and wickedness, do yet allow of, encourage, yea, and practise,
							this very abomination. I know there are several worthy gentlemen in
							Salem who account this practice as an abomination, have trembled to see
							the methods of this nature which others have used, and have declared
							themselves to think the practice to be very evil and corrupt. But all
							avails little with the abettors of the said practice.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>If Mr. Brattle and the “several worthy gentlemen” to whom he alludes, instead
						of sitting in “trembling” silence, or whispering in private their
						disapprobation, or writing letters under the injunction of secrecy, had come
						boldly out, and denounced the whole thing, in a spirit of true courage,
						meeting and defying the risk, and carrying the war home, and promptly, upon
						the ministers, magistrates, and judges, they might have succeeded, and
						exploded the delusion before it had reached its fatal results.</p>
					<p>He mentions, in the course of his letter, among those persons known by him to
						disapprove of the proceedings, —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“The Hon. Simon Bradstreet, Esq. (our late governor), the Hon. Thomas
							Danforth, Esq. (our late deputy-governor), the Rev. Mr. Increase Mather,
							and the Rev. Mr. Samuel Willard. Major N. Saltonstall, Esq., who was one
							of the judges, has left the court, and is very much dissatisfied with
							the proceedings of it. Excepting Mr. Hale, Mr. Noyes, and Mr. Parris,
							the reverend elders, almost throughout the whole country, are very much
							dissatisfied. Several of the late justices — viz., Thomas Graves, Esq.;
							N. Byfield, Esq.; Francis Foxcroft, Esq. — are much dissatisfied; also
							several of the present justices, and, in particular, some of the Boston
							justices, were resolved rather to throw up their commissions than be
							active in disturbing the liberty of Their Majesties' subjects merely on
							the accusations of these afflicted, possessed children.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>It is to be observed, that the dissatisfaction was with some of the methods
						adopted in the proceedings, and not with the prosecutions themselves.
						Increase Mather and Samuel Willard signed the paper indorsing Deodat
						Lawson's famous sermon, which surely drove on the prosecutions; and the
						former expressed, in print, his approbation of his son Cotton's “Wonders of
						the Invisible World,” in which he labors to defend the witchcraft
						prosecutions, and to make it out that those who suffered were “malefactors.”
							<pb n="456" id="vII456"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2469">
							<figDesc>Page 456.</figDesc>
						</figure> Dr. Increase Mather is understood to have countenanced the burning
						of Calef's book, some few years afterwards, in the square of the public
						grounds of Harvard College, of which institution he was then president. It
						cannot be doubted, however, that both the elder Mather and Mr. Willard had
						expressed, more or less distinctly, their disapprobation of some of the
						details of the proceedings. It is honorable to their memories, and shows
						that the former was not wholly blinded by parental weakness, but willing to
						express his dissent, in some particulars, from the course of his
						distinguished son, and that the latter had an independence of character
						which enabled him to criticise and censure a court in which three of his
						parishioners sat as judges.</p>
					<p>Brattle relates a story which seems to indicate that Increase Mather
						sometimes was unguarded enough to express himself with severity against
						those who gave countenance to the proceedings. “A person from Boston, of no
						small note, carried up his child to Salem, near twenty miles, on purpose
						that he might consult the afflicted about his child, which accordingly he
						did; and the afflicted told him that his child was afflicted by Mrs. Carey
						and Mrs. Obinson.” The “afflicted,” in this and some other instances, had
						struck too high. The magistrates in Boston were unwilling to issue a warrant
						against Mrs. Obinson, and Mrs. Carey had fled. All that the man got for his
						pains, in carrying his child to Salem, was a hearty scolding from Increase
						Mather, who asked him “whether there was not a God in Boston, that he should
						go to the Devil, in Salem, for advice.”</p>
					<p>Bradstreet's great age prevented, it is to be supposed, his public appearance
						in the affair; but his course in a case which occurred twelve years before
						fully justifies confidence in the statement of Brattle. The tradition has
						always prevailed, that he looked with disapprobation upon the proceedings,
						from beginning to end. The course of his sons, and the action taken against
						them, is quite decisive to the point.</p>
					<p>Facts have been stated, which show that Thomas Danforth, if he disapproved of
						the proceedings at Salem, in October, must have undergone a rapid change of
						sentiments. No irregularities, improprieties, extravagances, or absurdities
						ever occurred in the examinations or trials greater than he was fully
						responsible for in April. Having, in the mean while, been superseded in
						office, he <pb n="457" id="vII457"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2470">
							<figDesc>Page 457.</figDesc>
						</figure> had leisure, in his retirement, to think over the whole matter;
						and it is satisfactory to find that he saw the error of the ways in which he
						had gone himself, and led others.</p>
					<p>The result of the inquiry on this point is, that, while some, outside of the
						village, began early to doubt the propriety of the proceedings in certain
						particulars, they failed, with the single exception of Robert Pike, to make
						manly and seasonable resistance. He remonstrated in a writing signed with
						his own initials, and while the executions were going on. He sent it to one
						of the judges, and did not shrink from having his action known. No other
						voice was raised, no one else breasted the storm, while it lasted. The
						errors which led to the delusion were not attacked from any quarter at any
						time during that generation, and have remained lurking in many minds, in a
						greater or less degree, to our day.</p>
					<p>There were, however, three persons in Salem Village and its immediate
						vicinity, who deserve to be for ever remembered in this connection. They
						resisted the fanaticism at the beginning, and defined its wrath. Joseph
						Putnam was a little more than twenty-two years of age. He probably did not
						enter into the question of the doctrines then maintained on such subjects,
						but was led by his natural sagacity and independent spirit to the course he
						took. In opposition to both his brothers and both his uncles, and all the
						rest of his powerful and extensive family, he denounced the proceedings
						through and through. At the very moment when the excitement was at its most
						terrible stage, and Mr. Parris held the life of every one in his hands,
						Joseph Putnam expressed his disapprobation of his conduct by carrying his
						infant child to the church in Salem to be baptized. This was a public and
						most significant act. For six months, he kept some one of his horses under
						saddle night and day, without a moment's intermission of the precaution; and
						he and his family were constantly armed. It was understood, that, if any one
						attempted to arrest him, it would be at the peril of life. If the marshal
						should approach with overwhelming force, he would spring to his saddle, and
						bid defiance to pursuit. Such a course as this, taken by one standing alone
						against the whole community to which he belonged, shows a degree of courage,
						spirit, and resolution, which cannot but be held in honor.</p>

					</p>
					<p>Martha Corey was an aged Christian professor, of eminently devout habits and
						principles. It is, indeed, a strange fact, that, in her humble home,
						surrounded, as it then was, by a wilderness, this husbandman's wife should
						have reached a height so above and beyond her age. But it is proved
						conclusively by the depositions adduced against her, that her mind was
						wholly disenthralled from the errors of that period. She utterly repudiated
						the doctrines of witchcraft, and expressed herself freely and fearlessly
						against them. The prayer which this woman made “upon the ladder,” and which
						produced such an impression on those who heard it, was undoubtedly
						expressive of enlightened piety, worthy of being characterized as “eminent”
						in its sentiments, and in its demonstration of an innocent heart and
						life.</p>
					<p>The following paper, in the handwriting of Mr. Parris, is among the
						court-files. It has not the ordinary form of a deposition, but somehow was
						sworn to in Court: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“The morning after the examination of Goody Nurse, Sam. Sibley met John
							Procter about Mr. Phillips's, who called to said Sibley as he was going
							to said Phillips's, and asked how the folks did at the village. He
							answered, he heard they were very bad last night, but he had heard
							nothing this morning. Procter replied, he was going to fetch home his
							jade; he left her there last night, and had rather given forty shillings
							than let her come up. Said Sibley asked why he talked so. Procter
							replied, if they were let alone so, we should all be devils and witches
							quickly; they should rather be had to the whipping-post; but he would
							fetch his jade home, and thrash the Devil out of her, — and more to the
							like purpose, crying, `Hang them! hang them!”'</p>
					</q>
					<p>In another document, it is stated that Nathaniel Ingersoll and others heard
						John Procter tell Joseph Pope, “that, if he had John Indian in his custody,
						he would soon beat the Devil out of him.”</p>
					<p>The declarations thus ascribed to John Procter show that his views of the
						subject were about right; and it will probably be generally conceded, that
						the treatment he proposed for Mary Warren and “John Indian,” if dealt out to
						the “afflicted children” generally at the outset, would have prevented all
						the mischief. A sound thrashing all round, seasonably administered, would
						have reached the root of the matter; and the story which has now been
						concluded of Salem witchcraft would never have been told.</p>
					<p>When the witchcraft tornado burst upon Andover, it prostrated <pb n="459"
							id="vII459"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2472">
							<figDesc>Page 459.</figDesc>
						</figure> every thing before it. Accusers and accused were counted by
						scores, and under the panic of the hour the accused generally confessed. But
						Andover was the first to recover its senses. On the 12th of October, 1692,
						seven of its citizens addressed a memorial to the General Court in behalf of
						their wives and children, praying that they might be released on bond, “to
						remain as prisoners in their own houses, where they may be more tenderly
						cared for.” They speak of their “distressed condition in prison, — a company
						of poor distressed creatures as full of inward grief and trouble as they are
						able to bear up in life withal.” They refer to the want of “food convenient”
						for them, and to “the coldness of the winter season that is coming which may
						despatch such out of the way that have not been used to such hardships,” and
						represent the ruinous effects of their absence from their families, who were
						at the same time required to maintain them in jail. On the 18th of October,
						the two ministers of Andover, Francis Dane and Thomas Barnard, with
						twenty-four other citizens of Andover, addressed a similar memorial to the
						Governor and General Court, in which we find the first public expression of
						condemnation of the proceedings. They call the accusers “distempered
						persons.” They express the opinion that their friends and neighbors have
						been misrepresented. They bear the strongest testimony in favor of the
						persons accused, that several of them are members of the church in full
						communion, of blameless conversation, and “walking as becometh women
						professing godliness.” They relate the methods by which they had been
						deluded and terrified into confession, and show the worthlessness of those
						confessions as evidences against them. They use this bold and significant
						language: “Our troubles we foresee are likely to continue and increase, if
						other methods be not taken than as yet have been; and we know not who can
						think himself safe, if the accusations of children and others who are under
						a diabolical influence shall be received against persons of good fame.” On
						the 2d of January, 1693, the Rev. Francis Dane addressed a letter to a
						brother clergyman, which is among the files, and was probably designed to
						reach the eyes of the Court, in which he vindicates Andover against the
						scandalous reports got up by the accusers, and says that a residence there
						of forty-four years, and intimacy with the people, enable him to declare
						that they are not justly chargeable with any <pb n="460" id="vII460"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2473">
							<figDesc>Page 460.</figDesc>
						</figure> such things as witchcraft, charms, or sorceries of any kind. He
						expresses himself in strong language: “Had charity been put on, the Devil
						would not have had such an advantage against us, and I believe many innocent
						persons have been accused and imprisoned.” He denounces “the conceit of
						spectre evidence,” and warns against continuing in a course of proceeding
						that will procure “the divine displeasure.” A paper signed by Dudley
						Bradstreet, Francis Dane, Thomas Barnard, and thirty-eight other men and
						twelve women of Andover, was presented to the Court at Salem to the same
						effect.</p>
					<p>None of the persons named by Brattle can present so strong a claim to the
						credit of having opposed the witchcraft fanaticism before the close of the
						year 1692, as Francis Dane, his colleague Barnard, and the citizens of
						Andover, who signed memorials to the Legislature on the 18th of October, and
						to the Court of Trials about the same time. There is, indeed, one conclusive
						proof that the venerable senior pastor of the Andover Church made his
						disapprobation of the witchcraft proceedings known at an earlier period, at
						least in his immediate neighborhood. The wrath of the accusers was
						concentrated upon him to an unparalleled extent from their entrance into
						Andover. They did not venture to attack him directly. His venerable age and
						commanding position made it inexpedient; but they struck as near him, and at
						as many points, as they dared. They accused, imprisoned, and caused to be
						convicted and sentenced to death, one of his daughters, Abigail Faulkner.
						They accused, imprisoned, and brought to trial another, Elizabeth Johnson.
						They imprisoned, and brought to the sentence of death, his grand-daughter,
						Elizabeth Johnson, Jr. They cried out against, and caused to be imprisoned,
						several others of his grandchildren. They accused and imprisoned Deliverance
						the wife, and also the “man-servant,” of his son Nathaniel. There is reason
						for supposing, as has been stated, that Elizabeth How was the wife of his
						nephew. Surely, no one was more signalized by their malice and resentment
						than Francis Dane; and he deserves to be recognized as standing pre-eminent,
						and, for a time, almost alone, in bold denunciation and courageous
						resistance of the execrable proceedings of that dark day.</p>
					<p>Francis Dane made the following statement, also designed to reach the
						authorities, which cannot be read by any person of sensibility <pb n="461"

					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Concerning my daughter Elizabeth Johnson, I never had ground to suspect
							her, neither have I heard any other to accuse her, till by spectre
							evidence she was brought forth; but this I must say, she was weak, and
							incapacious, fearful, and in that respect I fear she hath falsely
							accused herself and others. Not long before she was sent for, she spake
							as to her own particular, that she was sure she was no witch. And for
							her daughter Elizabeth, she is but simplish at the best; and I fear the
							common speech, that was frequently spread among us, of their liberty if
							they would confess, and the like expression used by some, have brought

					<p>There is nothing in the proceedings of the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer
						more disgraceful than the fact, that the regular Court of Superior
						Judicature, the next year, after the public mind had been rescued from the
						delusion, and the spectral evidence repudiated, proceeded to try these and
						other persons, and, in the face of such statements as the foregoing,
						actually condemned to death Elizabeth Johnson, Jr.</p>
					<p>It is remarkable that Brattle does not mention Calef. The understanding has
						been that they acted in concert, and that Brattle had a hand in getting up
						some of Calef's arguments. The silence of Brattle is not, upon the whole, at
						all inconsistent with their mutual action and alliance. As Calef was more
						perfectly unembarrassed, without personal relations to the clergy and others
						in high station, and not afraid to stand in the gap, it was thought best to
						let him take the fire of Cotton Mather. His name had not been connected with
						the matter in the public apprehension. He was a merchant of Boston, and a
						son of Robert Calef of Roxbury. His attention was called to the proceedings
						which originated in Salem Village; and his strong faculties and moral
						courage enabled him to become the most efficient opponent, in his day, of
						the system of false reasoning upon which the prosecutions rested. He
						prepared several able papers in different forms, in which he discussed the
						subject with great ability, and treated Cotton Mather and all others whom he
						regarded as instrumental in precipitating the community into the fatal
						tragedy, <pb n="462" id="vII462"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2475">
							<figDesc>Page 462.</figDesc>
						</figure> with the greatest severity of language and force of logic, holding
						up the whole procedure to merited condemnation. They were first printed, at
						London, in 1700, in a small quarto volume, under the title of “More Wonders
						of the Invisible World.” This publication burst like a bomb-shell upon all
						who had been concerned in promoting the witchcraft prosecutions. Cotton
						Mather was exasperated to the highest pitch. He says in his diary: “He sent
						this vile volume to London to be published, and the book is printed; and the
						impression is, this day week, arrived here. The books that I have sent over
						into England, with a design to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, are not
						published, but strangely delayed; and the books that are sent over to vilify
						me, and render me incapable to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, — these are
						published.” Calef's writings gave a shock to Mather's influence, from which
						it never recovered.</p>
					<p>Great difficulty has been experienced in drawing the story out in its true
						chronological sequence. The effect produced upon the public mind, when it
						became convinced that the proceedings had been wrong, and innocent blood
						shed, was a universal disposition to bury the recollection of the whole
						transaction in silence, and, if possible, oblivion. This led to a
						suppression and destruction of the ordinary materials of history. Papers
						were abstracted from the files, documents in private hands were committed to
						the flames, and a chasm left in the records of churches and public bodies.
						The journal of the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer is nowhere to be
						found. Hutchinson appears to have had access to it. It cannot well be
						supposed to have been lost by fire or other accident, because the records of
						the regular Court, up to the very time when the Special Court came into
						operation, and from the time when it expired, are preserved in order. A
						portion of the papers connected with the trials have come down in a
						miscellancous, scattered, and dilapidated state, in the offices of the Clerk
						of the Courts in the County of Essex, and of the Secretary of the
						Commonwealth. By far the larger part have been abstracted, of which a few
						have been deposited, by parties into whose hands they had happened to come,
						with the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston and the Essex Institute
						at Salem. The records of the parish of Salem Village, although exceedingly
						well kept before and after 1692 by Thomas Putnam, are in another hand for

						transactions. This general desire to obliterate the memory of the calamity
						has nearly extinguished tradition. It is more scanty and less reliable than
						on any other event at an equal distance in the past. A subject on which men
						avoided to speak soon died out of knowledge. The localities of many very
						interesting incidents cannot be identified. This is very observable, and
						peculiarly remarkable as to places in the now City of Salem. The
						reminiscences floating about are vague, contradictory, and few in number. In
						a community of uncommon intelligence, composed, to a greater degree perhaps
						than almost any other, of families that have been here from the first, very
						inquisitive for knowledge, and always imbued with the historical spirit, it
						is truly surprising how little has been borne down, by speech and memory, in
						the form of anecdote, personal traits, or local incidents, of this most
						extraordinary and wonderful occurrence of such world-wide celebrity. Almost
						all that we know is gleaned from the offices of the Registry of Deeds and
							Wills.<note target="v2n10" place="unspecified" anchored="yes"

					<p>to describe, into which the community suffered itself to be led in the
						witchcraft proceedings of 1692, — with a desire, on the contrary, to make
						the lesson then given of the mischief resulting from misguided enthusiasm,
						and which will always result when popular excitement is allowed to wield the
						organized powers of society, as impressive as facts and truth will justify,
						— I feel bound to say, in advance, that there are some considerations which
						we must keep before us, while reviewing the incidents of the transaction.
						The theological, legal, and philosophical doctrines and the popular beliefs,
						on which it was founded, have, as I have shown, led, in other countries and
						periods, to similar, and often vastly more shameful, cruel, and destructive
						results. But there was something in the affair, as it was developed here,
						that has arrested the notice of mankind, and clothed it with an inherent
						interest, beyond all other events of the kind that have elsewhere or ever
						occurred.</p>
					<p>The moral force engendered in the civilization planted on these shores, and
						pervading the whole body of society, supplied a mightier momentum, as it
						does to this day, and ever will, to the movement of the people, acting in a
						mass and as a unit, than can anywhere else be found. A population,
						invigorated by hardy enterprise, and the constant exercise of all the
						faculties of freedom, and actuated throughout by individual energy of
						character, must be mightier in motion than any other people. Such a
						population multiplies tenfold its physical forces, by the addition of <pb

						</figure> she followed him so soon to the grave. Of the other accusers, we
						have but little information. Elizabeth Booth was married to Israel Shaw
						about the year 1700. Mary Walcot was married, somewhere between 1692 and
						1697, to a person belonging to Woburn, whose name is torn or worn off from
						Mr. Parris's records. Of the other “afflicted children” nothing is known,
						beyond the fact, that the Act of the Legislature of the Province, reversing
						the judgments, and taking off the attainder from those who were sentenced to
						death in 1692, has this paragraph: “Some of the principal accusers and
						witnesses in those dark and severe prosecutions have since discovered
						themselves to be persons of profligate and vicious conversation;” and Calef
						speaks of them as “vile varlets,” and asserts that their reputations were
						not without spot before, and that subsequently they became abandoned to open
						and shameless vice.</p>
					<p>A very considerable number of the people left the place. John Shepard and
						Samuel Sibley sold their lands, and went elsewhere; as did Peter Cloyse, who
						never brought his family to the village after his wife's release from
						prison. Edward and Sarah Bishop sold their estates, and took up their abode
						at Rehoboth. Some of the Raymond family removed to Middleborough. The Haynes
						family emigrated to New Jersey. No mention is afterwards found of other
						families in the record-books. The descendants of Thomas and Edward Putnam,
						in the next generation, were mostly dispersed <pb n="466" id="vII466"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2479">
							<figDesc>Page 466.</figDesc>
						</figure> to other places; but those of Joseph remained on his lands, and
						have occupied his homestead to this day. It is a singular circumstance, that
						some of the spots where, particularly, the great mischief was brewed, are,
						and long have been, deserted. Where the parsonage stood, with its barn and
						garden and well and pathways, is now a bare and rugged field, without a
						vestige of its former occupancy, except a few broken bricks that mark the
						site of the house. The same is the case of the homestead of Jonathan Walcot.
						It was in these two families that the affair began and was matured. The
						spots where several others, who figured in the proceedings, lived, have
						ceased to be occupied; and the only signs of former habitation are hollows
						in the ground, fragments of pottery, and heaps of stones denoting the
						location of cellars and walls. Here and there, where houses and other
						structures once stood, the blight still rests.</p>
					<p>Some circumstances relating to the personal history of those who experienced
						the greatest misery during the prevalence of the dreadful fanaticism, and
						were left to mourn over its victims, have happened to be preserved in
						records and documents on file. On the 30th of November, 1699, Margaret
						Jacobs was married to John Foster. She belonged to Mr. Noyes's parish; but
						the recollection of his agency in pushing on proceedings which carried in
						their train the execution of her aged grandfather, the exile of her father,
						the long imprisonment of her mother and herself, with the prospect of a
						violent and shameful death hanging over them every hour, and, above all, her
						own wretched abandonment of truth and conscience for a while, probably under
						his persuasion, made it impossible for her to think of being married by him.
						Mr. Greene was known to sympathize with those who had suffered, and the
						couple went to the village to be united. Some years afterwards, when the
						church of the Middle Precinct, now South Danvers, was organized, John and
						Margaret Foster, among the first, took their children there for baptism; and
						their descendants are numerous, in this neighborhood and elsewhere.
						Margaret, the widow of John Willard, married William Towne. Elizabeth, the
						widow of John Procter, married, subsequently to 1696, a person named
						Richards. Edward Bishop, the husband of Bridget, a few years afterwards was
						appointed guardian of Susannah Mason, the only child of Christian, who was
						the only child of Bridget by her <pb n="467" id="vII467"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2480">
							<figDesc>Page 467.</figDesc>
						</figure> former husband Thomas Oliver. Bishop seems to have invested the
						money of his ward in the lot at the extreme end of Forrester Street, where
						it connects with Essex Street, bounded by Forrester Street on the north and
						east, and Essex Street on the south. This was the property of Susannah when
						she married John Becket, Jr. Bishop appears to have continued his business
						of a sawyer to a very advanced age, and died in Salem, in 1705.</p>
					<p>Sarah Nurse, about two years after her mother's death, married Michael
						Bowden, of Marblehead; and they occupied her father's house, in the town of
						Salem, of which he had retained the possession. His family having thus all
						been married off, Francis Nurse gave up his homestead to his son Samuel, and
						divided his remaining property among his four sons and four daughters. He
						made no formal deed or will, but drew up a paper, dated Dec. 4, 1694,
						describing the distribution of the estate, and what he expected of his
						children. He gave them immediate occupancy and possession of their
						respective portions. The provision made by the old man for his comfort, and
						the conditions required of his children, are curious. They give an
						interesting insight of the life of a rural patriarch. He reserved his “great
						chair and cushion;” a great chest; his bed and bedding; wardrobe, linen and
						woollen; a pewter pot; one mare, bridle, saddle, and sufficient fodder; the
						whole of the crop of corn, both Indian and English, he had made that year.
						The children were to discharge all the debts of his estate, pay him fourteen
						pounds a year, and contribute equally, as much more as might be necessary
						for his comfortable maintenance, and also to his “decent burial.” The labors
						of his life had closed. He had borne the heaviest burden that can be laid on
						the heart of a good man. He found rest, and sought solace and support, in
						the society and love of his children and their families, as he rode from
						house to house on the road he had opened, by which they all communicated
						with each other. The parish records show that he continued his interest in
						its affairs. He lived just long enough to behold sure evidence that justice
						would be done to the memory of those who suffered, and the authors of the
						mischief be consigned to the condemnation of mankind. The tide, upon which
						Mr. Parris had ridden to the destruction of so many, had turned; and it was
						becoming apparent to all, that <pb n="468" id="vII468"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2481">
							<figDesc>Page 468.</figDesc>
						</figure> he would soon be compelled to disappear from his ministry in the
						village, before the awakening resentment of the people and the ministers.
						Francis Nurse died on the 22d of November, 1695, seventy-seven years of age.
						His sons with their wives, and his daughters with their husbands, went into
						the Probate Court with the paper before described, and unanimously requested
						the judge to have the estate divided according to its terms. This is
						conclusive proof that the father had been just and wise in his arrangements,
						and that true fraternal love and harmony pervaded the whole family. The
						descendants, under the names of Bowden, Tarbell, and Russell, are dispersed
						in various parts of the country: those under the name of Preston, while some
						have gone elsewhere, have been ever since, and still are, among the most
						respectable and honored citizens of the village. Some of the name of Nurse
						have also remained, and worthily represent and perpetuate it.</p>
					<p>I have spoken of the tide's beginning to turn in 1695. Sure indications to
						that effect were then quite visible. It had begun far down in the public
						mind before the prosecutions ceased; but it was long before the change
						became apparent on the surface. It was long before men found utterance for
						their feelings.</p>
					<p>Persons living at a distance have been accustomed, and are to this day, to
						treat the Salem-witchcraft transaction in the spirit of lightsome ridicule,
						and to make it the subject of jeers and jokes. Not so those who have lived
						on, or near, the fatal scene. They have ever regarded it with solemn awe and
						profound sorrow, and shunned the mention, and even the remembrance, of its
						details. This prevented an immediate expression of feeling, and delayed
						movements in the way of attempting a reparation of the wrongs that had been
						committed. The heart sickened, the lips were dumb, at the very thought of
						those wrongs. Reparation was impossible. The dead were beyond its reach. The
						sorrows and anguish of survivors were also beyond its reach. The voice of
						sympathy was felt to be unworthy to obtrude upon sensibilities that had been
						so outraged. The only refuge left for the individuals who had been bereaved,
						and for the body of the people who realized that innocent blood was on all
						their hands, was in humble and soul-subdued silence, and in prayers for
						forgiveness from God and from each other.</p>
					<pb n="469" id="vII469"/>
					<p>
						<figure id="Uphv2482">

						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>It was long before the public mind recovered from its paralysis. No one knew
						what ought to be said or done, the tragedy had been so awful. The parties
						who had acted in it were so numerous, and of such standing, including almost
						all the most eminent and honored leaders of the community from the bench,
						the bar, the magistracy, the pulpit, the medical faculty, and in fact all
						classes and descriptions of persons; the mysteries connected with the
						accusers and confessors; the universal prevalence of the legal, theological,
						and philosophical theories that had led to the proceedings; the utter
						impossibility of realizing or measuring the extent of the calamity; and the
						general shame and horror associated with the subject in all minds; prevented
						any open movement. Then there was the dread of rekindling animosities which
						time was silently subduing, and nothing but time could fully extinguish.
						Slowly, however, the remembrance of wrongs was becoming obscured.
						Neighborhood and business relations were gradually reconciling the
						estranged. Offices of civility, courtesy, and good-will were reviving;
						social and family intimacies and connections were taking effect and
						restoring the community to a natural and satisfactory condition. Every day,
						the sentiment was sinking deeper in the public mind, that something was
						required to be done to avert the displeasure of Heaven from a guilty land.
						But while some were ready to forgive, and some had the grace to ask to be
						forgiven, any general movement in this direction was obstructed by
						difficulties hard to be surmounted.</p>
					<p>The wrongs committed were so remediless, the outrages upon right, character,
						and life, had been so shocking, that it was expecting too much from the
						ordinary standard of humanity to demand a general oblivion. On the other
						hand, so many had been responsible for them, and their promoters embraced
						such a great majority of all the leading classes of society, that it was
						impossible to call them to account. Dr. Bentley describes the condition of
						the community, in some brief and pregnant sentences, characteristic of his
						peculiar style: “As soon as the judges ceased to condemn, the people ceased
						to accuse.... Terror at the violence and guilt of the proceedings succeeded
						instantly to the conviction of blind zeal; and what every man had encouraged
						all professed to abhor. Few dared to blame other men, because <pb n="470"
							id="vII470"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2483">
							<figDesc>Page 470.</figDesc>
						</figure> few were innocent. The guilt and the shame became the portion of
						the country, while Salem had the infamy of being the place of the
						transactions.... After the public mind became quiet, few things were done to
						disturb it. But a diminished population, the injury done to religion, and
						the distress of the aggrieved, were seen and felt with the greatest
						sorrow.... Every place was the subject of some direful tale. Fear haunted
						every street. Melancholy dwelt in silence in every place, after the sun
						retired. Business could not, for some time, recover its former channels; and
						the innocent suffered with the guilty.”</p>
					<p>While the subject was felt to be too dark and awful to be spoken of, and most
						men desired to bury it in silence, occasionally the slumbering fires would
						rekindle, and the flames of animosity burst forth. The recollection of the
						part he had acted, and the feelings of many towards him in consequence,
						rendered the situation of the sheriff often quite unpleasant; and the
						resentment of some broke out in a shameful demonstration at his death, which
						occurred early in 1697. Mr. English, representing that class who had
						suffered under his official hands in 1692, having a business demand upon
						him, in the shape of a suit for debt, stood ready to seize his body after it
						was prepared for interment, and prevented the funeral at the time. The body
						was temporarily deposited on the sheriff's own premises. There were, it is
						probable, from time to time, other less noticeable occurrences manifesting
						the long-continued existence of the unhappy state of feeling engendered in
						1692. There were really two parties in the community, generally both
						quiescent, but sometimes coming into open collision; the one exasperated by
						the wrongs they and their friends had suffered, the other determined not to
						allow those who had acted in conducting the prosecutions to be called to
						account for what they had done. After the lapse of thirty years, and long
						subsequent to the death of Mr. Noyes, Mr. English was prosecuted for having
						said that Mr. Noyes had murdered Rebecca Nurse and John Procter.</p>
					<p>It has been suggested, that the bearing of the executive officers of the law
						towards the prisoners was often quite harsh. This resulted from the general
						feeling, in which these officials would have been likely to sympathize, of
						the peculiarly execrable nature of the crime charged upon the accused, and
						from the danger that <pb n="471" id="vII471"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2484">
							<figDesc>Page 471.</figDesc>
						</figure> might attend the manifestation of any appearance of kindly regard
						for them. So far as the seizure of goods is considered, or the exaction of
						fees, the conduct of the officials was in conformity with usage and
						instructions. The system of the administration of the law, compared with our
						times, was stern, severe, and barbarous. The whole tone of society was more
						unfeeling. Philanthropy had not then extended its operations, or directed
						its notice, to the prison. Sheriff Corwin was quite a young man, being but
						twenty-six years of age at the time of his appointment. He probably acted
						under the advice of his relatives and connections on the bench. I think
						there is no evidence of any particular cruelty evinced by him. The arrests,
						examinations, and imprisonments had taken place under his predecessor,
						Marshal Herrick, who continued in the service as his deputy.</p>
					<p>That individual, indeed, had justly incurred the resentment of the sufferers
						and their friends, by eager zeal in urging on the prosecutions, perpetual
						officiousness, and unwarrantable interference against the prisoners at the
						preliminary examinations. The odium originally attached to the marshal seems
						to have been transferred to his successor, and the whole was laid at the
						door of the sheriff. Marshal Herrick does not appear to have been connected
						with Joseph Herrick, who lived on what is now called Cherry Hill, but was a
						man of an entirely different stamp. He was thirty-four years of age, and had
						not been very long in the country. John Dunton speaks of meeting him in
						Salem, in 1686, and describes him as a “very tall, handsome man, very
						regular and devout in his attendance at church, religious without bigotry,
						and having every man's good word.” His impatient activity against the
						victims of the witchcraft delusion wrought a great change in the condition
						of this popular and “handsome” man, as is seen in a petition presented by
						him, Dec. 8, 1692, to “His Excellency Sir William Phips, Knight,
						Captain-general and Governor of Their Majesties' Territories and Dominions
						of Massachusetts Bay in New England; and to the Honorable William Stoughton,
						Esq., Deputy-Governor; and to the rest of the Honored Council.” It begins
						thus: “The petition of your poor servant, George Herrick, most humbly
						showeth.” After recounting his great and various services “for the term of
						nine months, as marshal or deputy-sheriff in apprehending many prisoners,
						and conveying <pb n="472" id="vII472"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2485">
							<figDesc>Page 472.</figDesc>
						</figure> them “unto prison and from prison to prison,” he complains that
						his whole time had been taken up so that he was incapable of getting any
						thing for the maintenance of his “poor family:” he further states that he
						had become so impoverished that necessity had forced him to lay down his
						place; and that he must certainly come to want, if not in some measure
						supplied. “Therefore I humbly beseech Your Honors to take my case and
						condition so far into consideration, that I may have some supply this hard
						winter, that I and my poor children may not be destitute of sustenance, and
						so inevitably perish; for I have been bred a gentleman, and not much used to
						work, and am become despicable in these hard times.” He concludes by
						declaring, that he is not “weary of serving his king and country,” nor very
						scrupulous as to the kind of service; for he promises that “if his
						habitation” could thereby be “graced with plenty in the room of penury,
						there shall be no services too dangerous and difficult, but your poor
						petitioner will gladly accept, and to the best of my power accomplish. I
						shall wholly lay myself at Your Honorable feet for relief.” Marshal Herrick
						died in 1695.</p>
					<p>But, while this feeling was spreading among the people, the government were
						doing their best to check it. There was great apprehension, that, if allowed
						to gather force, it would burst over all barriers, that no limit would be
						put to its demands for the restoration of property seized by the officers of
						the law, and that it would wreak vengeance upon all who had been engaged in
						the prosecutions. Under the influence of this fear, the following attempt
						was made to shield the sheriff of the county from prosecutions for damages
						by those whose relatives had suffered: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">

					<p>At length, the government had to meet the public feeling. A proclamation was
						issued, “By the Honorable the Lieutenant, Council, and Assembly of His
						Majesty's province of the Massachusetts Bay, in General Court assembled.” It
						begins thus: “Whereas the anger of God is not yet turned away, but his hand
						is still stretched out against his people in manifold judgments;” and, after
						several specifications of the calamities under which they were suffering,
						and referring to the “many days of public and solemn” addresses made to God,
						it proceeds: “Yet we cannot but also fear that there is something still
						wanting to accompany our supplications; and doubtless there are some
						particular sins which God is angry with our Israel for, that have not been
						duly seen and resented by us, about which God expects to be sought, if ever
						he again turn our captivity.” Thursday, the fourteenth of the next January,
						was accordingly appointed to be observed as a day of prayer and fasting,
						—</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">

					<p>The jury had acted in conformity with their obligations and honest
						convictions of duty in bringing in their verdicts. They had sworn to decide
						according to the law and the evidence. The law under which they were
						required to act was laid down with absolute positiveness by the Court. They
						were bound to receive it, and to take and weigh the evidence that was
						admitted; and to their minds it was clear, decisive, and overwhelming,
						offered by persons of good character, and confirmed by a great number of
						confessions. If it had been within their province, as it always is declared
						not to be, to discuss the general principles, and sit in judgment on the
						particular penalties of law, it would not have altered the case; for, at
						that time, not only the common people, but the wisest philosophers,
						supported the interpretation of the law that acknowledged the existence of
						witchcraft, and its sanction that visited it with death.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding all this, however, so tender and sensitive were the
						consciences of the jurors, that they signed and circulated the following
						humble and solemn declaration of regret for the part they had borne in the
						trials. As the publication of this paper was highly honorable to those who
						signed it, and cannot but be contemplated with satisfaction by all their
						descendants, I will repeat their names: —</p>

						<p>“We whose names are underwritten, being in the year 1692 called to serve
							as jurors in court at Salem, on trial of many who were by some suspected
							guilty of doing acts of witchcraft upon the bodies of sundry persons, —
							we confess that we ourselves were not capable to understand, nor able to
							withstand, the mysterious delusions of the powers of darkness and Prince
							of the air, but were, for want of knowledge in ourselves and better
							information from others, prevailed with to take up with such evidence
							against the accused as, on further consideration and better information,
							we justly fear was insufficient for the touching the lives of any (Deut.
							xvii. 6), whereby we fear we have been instrumental, with others, though
							ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon ourselves and this people of
							the Lord the guilt of innocent blood; which sin the Lord saith in

							and to the surviving sufferers in special, our deep sense of, and sorrow
							for, our errors in acting on such evidence to the condemning of any
							person; and do hereby declare, that we justly fear that we were sadly
							deluded and mistaken, — for which we are much disquieted and distressed
							in our minds, and do therefore humbly beg forgiveness, first, of God,
							for Christ's sake, for this our error, and pray that God would not
							impute the guilt of it to ourselves nor others: and we also pray that we
							may be considered candidly and aright by the living sufferers, as being
							then under the power of a strong and general delusion, utterly
							unacquainted with, and not experienced in, matters of that nature.</p>
						<p>“We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly offended;
							and do declare, according to our present minds, we would none of us do

					<p>In 1697, Rev. John Hale, of Beverly, published a work on the subject of the
						witchcraft persecutions, in which he gives the reasons which led him to the
						conclusion that there was error at the foundation of the proceedings. The
						following extract shows that he took a rational view of the subject: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“It may be queried then, How doth it appear that there was a going too
							far in this affair?</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Answer</hi> I. — By the number of persons accused.
							It cannot be imagined, that, in a place of so much knowledge, so many,
							in so small a compass of land, should so abominably leap into the
							Devil's lap, — at once.</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> II. — The quality of several of the
							accused was such as did bespeak better things, and things that accompany
							salvation. Persons whose blameless and holy lives before did testify for
							them; persons that had taken great pains to bring up <hi rend="italics"
								>their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> such
							as we had charity for as for our <pb n="476" id="vII476"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2489">
								<figDesc>Page 476.</figDesc>
							</figure> own souls, — and charity is a Christian duty, commended to us
							in 1 Cor. xiii., Col. iii. 14, and many other places.</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> III. — The number of the afflicted by
							Satan daily increased, till about fifty persons were thus vexed by the
							Devil. This gave just ground to suspect some mistake.</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> IV. — It was considerable, that nineteen
							were executed, and all denied the crime to the death; and some of them
							were knowing persons, and had before this been accounted blameless
							livers. And it is not to be imagined but that, if all had been guilty,
							some would have had so much tenderness as to seek mercy for their souls
							in the way of confession, and sorrow for such a sin.</p>
						<p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ans.</hi> V. — When this prosecution ceased, the
							Lord so chained up Satan, that the afflicted grew presently well: the
							accused are generally quiet, and for five years since we have no such
							molestation by them.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Such reasonings as these found their way into the minds of the whole
						community; and it became the melancholy conviction of all candid and
						considerate persons that innocent blood had been shed. Standing where we do,
						with the lights that surround us, we look back upon the whole scene as an
						awful perversion of justice, reason, and truth.</p>
					<p>On the 13th of June, 1700, Abigail Faulkner presented a well memorial to the
						General Court, in which she says that her pardon “so far had its effect, as
						that I am yet suffered to live, but this only as a malefactor convict upon
						record of the most heinous crimes that mankind can be supposed to be guilty
						of;” and prays for “the defacing of the record” against her. She claims it
						as no more than a simple act of justice; stating that the evidence against
						her was wholly confined to the “afflicted, who pretended to see me by their
						spectral sight, and not with their bodily eyes.” That “the jury (upon only
						their testimony) brought me in `Guilty,' and the sentence of death was
						passed upon me;” and that it had been decided that such testimony was of no
						value. The House of Representatives felt the force of her appeal, and voted
						that “the prayer of the petitioner be granted.” The council declined to
						concur, but addressed “His Excellency to grant the petitioner His Majesty's
						gracious pardon; and His Excellency expressed His readiness to grant the
						same.” Some adverse influence, it seemed, prevailed to prevent it.</p>
					<p>On the 18th of March, 1702, another petition was presented to <pb n="477"
							id="vII477"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2490">
							<figDesc>Page 477.</figDesc>
						</figure> the General Court, by persons of Andover, Salcm Village, and
						Topsfield, who had suffered imprisonment and condemnation, and by the
						relations of others who had been condemned and executed on the testimony, as
						they say, of “possessed persons,” to this effect: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Your petitioners being dissatisfied and grieved that (besides what the
							condemned persons have suffered in their persons and estates) their
							names are exposed to infamy and reproach, while their trial and
							condemnation stands upon public record, we therefore humbly pray this
							honored Court that something may be publicly done to take off infamy
							from the names and memory of those who have suffered as aforesaid, that
							none of their surviving relations nor their posterity may suffer
							reproach on that account.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>[Signed by Francis Faulkner, Isaac Easty, Thorndike Procter, and eighteen
						others.]</p>
					<p>On the 20th of July, in answer to the foregoing petitions, a bill was ordered
						by the House of Representatives to be drawn up, forbidding in future such
						procedures, as in the witchcraft trials of 1692; declaring that “no spectre
						evidence may hereafter be accounted valid or sufficient to take away the
						life or good name of any person or persons within this province, and that
						the infamy and reproach cast on the names and posterity of said accused and
						condemned persons may in some measure be rolled away.” The council concurred
						with an additional clause, to acquit all condemned persons “of the penalties
						to which they are liable upon the convictions and judgments in the courts,
						and estate them in their just credit and reputation, as if no such judgment
						had been had.”</p>
					<p>This petition was re-enforced by an “address” to the General Court, dated
						July 8, 1703, by several ministers of the county of Essex. They speak of the
						accusers in the witchcraft trials as “young persons under diabolical
						molestations,” and express this sentiment: “There is great reason to fear
						that innocent persons then suffered, and that God may have a controversy
						with the land upon that account.” They earnestly beg that the prayer of the
						petitioners, lately presented, may be granted. This petition was signed by
						Thomas Barnard, of Andover; Joseph Green, of Salem Village; William Hubbard,
						John Wise, John Rogers, and Jabez <pb n="478" id="vII478"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2491">

						</figure> Fitch, of Ipswich; Benjamin Rolfe, of Haverhill; Samuel Cheever,
						of Marblehead; Joseph Gerrish, of Wenham; Joseph Capen, of Topsfield;
						Zechariah Symmes, of Bradford; and Thomas Symmes, of Boxford. Francis Dane,
						of Andover, had died six years before. John Hale, of Beverly, had died three
						years before. The great age of John Higginson, of Salem, — eighty-seven
						years, — probably prevented the papers being handed to him. It is
						observable, that Nicholas Noyes, his colleague, is not among the
						signers.</p>
					<p>What prevented action, we do not know; but nothing was done. Six years
						afterwards, on the 25th of May, 1709, an “humble address” was presented to
						the General Court by certain inhabitants of the province, some of whom “had
						their near relations, either parents or others, who suffered death in the
						dark and doleful times that passed over this province in 1692;” and others
						“who themselves, or some of their relations, were imprisoned, impaired and
						blasted in their reputations and estates by reason of the same.” They pray
						for the passage of a “suitable act” to restore the reputations of the
						sufferers, and to make some remuneration “as to what they have been
						damnified in their estates thereby.” This paper was signed by Philip English
						and twenty others. Philip English gave in an account in detail of what
						articles were seized and carried away, at the time of his arrest, from four
						of his warehouses, his wharf, and shop-house, besides the expenses incurred
						in prison, and in escaping from it. It appears by this statement, that he
						and his wife were nine weeks in jail at Salem and Boston. Nothing was done
						at this session. The next year, Sept. 12, 1710, Isaac Easty presented a
						strong memorial to the General Court in reference to his case. He calls for
						some remuneration. In speaking of the arrest and execution of his “beloved
						wife,” he says “my sorrow and trouble of heart in being deprived of her in
						such a manner, which this world can never make me any compensation for.” At
						the same time, the daughters of Elizabeth How, the son of Sarah Wildes, the
						heirs of Mary Bradbury, Edward Bishop and his wife Sarah, sent in severally
						similar petitions, — all in earnest and forcible language. Charles, one of
						the sons of George Burroughs, presented the case of his “dear and honored
						father;” declaring that his innocence of the crime of which he was accused,
						and his excellence of character, were shown in “his careful catechising his
						children, and upholding <pb n="479" id="vII479"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2492">
							<figDesc>Page 479.</figDesc>
						</figure> religion in his family, and by his solemn and savory written
						instructions from prison.” He describes in affecting details the condition
						in which his father's family of little children was left at his death. One
						of Mr. Burroughs's daughters, upon being required to sign a paper in
						reference to compensation, expresses her distress of mind in these words:
						“Every discourse on this melancholy subject doth but give a fresh wound to
						my bleeding heart. I desire to sit down in silence.” John Moulton, in behalf
						of the family of Giles Corey, says that they “cannot sufficiently express
						their grief” for the death, in such a manner, of “their honored father and
						mother.” Samuel Nurse, in behalf of his brothers and sisters, says that
						their “honored and dear mother had led a blameless life from her youth
						up.... Her name and the name of her posterity lies under reproach, the
						removing of which reproach is the principal thing wherein we desire
						restitution. And, as we know not how to express our loss of such a mother in
						such a way, so we know not how to compute our charge, but leave it to the
						judgment of others, and shall not be critical.” He distinctly intimates,
						that they do not wish any money to be paid them, unless “the attainder is
						taken off.” Many other petitions were presented by the families of those who
						suffered, all in the same spirit; and several besides the Nurses insisted
						mainly upon the “taking off the attainder.”</p>
					<p>The General Court, on the 17th of October, 1710, passed an act, that “the
						several convictions, judgments, and attainders be, and hereby are, reversed,
						and declared to be null and void.” In simple justice, they ought to have
						extended the act to all who had suffered; but they confined its effect to
						those in reference to whom petitions had been presented. The families of
						some of them had disappeared, or may not have had notice of what was going
						on; so that the sentence which the Government acknowledged to have been
						unjust remains to this day unreversed against the names and memory of
						Bridget Bishop, Susanna Martin, Alice Parker, Ann Pudeator, Wilmot Read, and
						Margaret Scott. The stain on the records of the Commonwealth has never been
						fully effaced. What caused this dilatory and halting course on the part of
						the Government, and who was responsible for it, cannot be ascertained. Since
						the presentation of Abigail Faulkner's petition in 1700, the Legislature, in
						the popular branch at least, and the <pb n="480" id="vII480"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2493">
							<figDesc>Page 480.</figDesc>
						</figure> Governor, appear to have been inclined to act favorably in the
						premises; but some power blocked the way. There is some reason to conjecture
						that it was the influence of the home government. Its consent to have the
						prosecutions suspended, in 1692, was not very cordial, but, while it
						approved of “care and circumspection therein,” expressed reluctance to allow
						any “impediment to the ordinary course of justice.”</p>
					<p>On the 17th of December, 1711, Governor Dudley issued his warrant for the
						purpose of carrying out a vote of the “General Assembly,” “by and with the
						advice and consent of Her Majesty Council,” to pay “the sum of ¥578. 12<hi
							rend="italics">s.</hi>” to “such persons as are living, and to those
						that legally represent them that are dead;” which sum was divided as
						follows: —</p>

					<p>The distribution, as above, according to the evidence as it has come down to

						<figure id="Uphv2494">
							<figDesc>Page 481.</figDesc>
						</figure> amount, and the long delay before it was ordered, are
						discreditable to the province. One of the larger sums was allowed to William
						Good, while he clearly deserved nothing, as he was an adverse witness in the
						examination of his wife, and did what he could to promote the prosecution
						against her. He did not, it is true, swear that he believed her to be a
						witch; but what he said tended to prejudice the magistrates and the public
						against her. Benjamin Putnam acted as his attorney, and received the money
						for him. Good was a retainer and dependant of that branch of the Putnam
						family; and its influence gave him so large a proportionate amount, and not
						the reason or equity of the case. More was allowed to Abigail Hobbs, a very
						malignant witness against the prisoners, than to the families of several who
						were executed. Nearly twice as much was allowed for Abigail Faulkner, who
						was pardoned, as for Elizabeth How, who was executed. The sums allowed in
						the cases of Parker, Carrier, and Foster, were shamefully small. The public
						mind evidently was not satisfied; and the Legislature were pressed for a
						half-century to make more adequate compensation, and thereby vindicate the
						sentiment of justice, and redeem the honor of the province.</p>
					<p>On the 8th of December, 1738, Major Samuel Sewall, a son of the Judge,
						introduced an order in the House of Representatives for the appointment of a
						committee to get information relating to “the circumstances of the persons
						and families who suffered in the calamity of the times in and about the year
						1692.” Major Sewall entered into the matter with great zeal. The House
						unanimously passed the order. He was chairman of the committee; and, on the
						9th of December, wrote to his cousin Mitchel Sewall in Salem, son of
						Stephen, earnestly requesting him and John Higginson, Esq., to aid in
						accomplishing the object. The following is an extract from a speech
						delivered by Governor Belcher to both Houses of the Legislature, Nov. 22,
						1740. It is honorable to his memory.</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“The Legislature have often honored themselves in a kind and generous
							remembrance of such families and of the posterity of such as have been
							sufferers, either in their persons or estates, for or by the Government,
							of which the public records will give you many instances. I should
							therefore be glad there might be a committee appointed by this Court to
							inquire into the sufferings of the people called Quakers, in the early
							days of this country, as also into the descendants of such <pb n="482"
								id="vII482"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2495">
								<figDesc>Page 482.</figDesc>
							</figure> families as were in a manner ruined in the mistaken management
							of the terrible affair called witchcraft. I really think there is
							something incumbent on this Government to be done for relieving the
							estates and reputations of the posterities of the unhappy families that
							so suffered; and the doing it, though so long afterwards, would
							doubtless be acceptable to Almighty God, and would reflect honor upon
							the present Legislature.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>On the 31st of May, 1749, the heirs of George Burroughs addressed a petition
						to Governor Shirley and the General Court, setting forth “the unparalleled
						persecutions and sufferings” of their ancestor, and praying for “some
						recompense from this Court for the losses thereby sustained by his family.”
						It was referred to a committee of both Houses. The next year, the
						petitioners sent a memorial to Governor Spencer Phips and the General Court,
						stating, that “it hath fell out, that the Hon. Mr. Danforth, chairman of the
						said committee, had not, as yet, called them together so much as once to act
						thereon, even to this day, as some of the honorable committee themselves
						were pleased, with real concern, to signify to your said petitioners.” The
						House immediately passed this order: “That the committee within referred to
						be directed to sit forthwith, consider the petition to them committed, and
						report as soon as may be.”</p>
					<p>All that I have been able to find, as the result of these long and
						long-protracted movements, is a statement of Dr. Bentley, that the heirs of
						Philip English received two hundred pounds. He does not say when the act to
						this effect was passed. Perhaps some general measure of the kind was
						adopted, the record of which I have failed to meet. The engrossing interest
						of the then pending French war, and of the vehement dissensions that led to
						the Revolution, probably prevented any further attention to this subject,
						after the middle of the last century.</p>
					<p>It is apparent from the foregoing statements and records, that while many
						individuals, the people generally, and finally Governor Belcher and the
						House of Representatives emphatically, did what they could, there was an
						influence that prevailed to prevent for a long time, if not for ever, any
						action of the province to satisfy the demands made by justice and the honor
						of the country in repairing the great wrongs committed by the legislative,
						executive, and judicial branches of the Government in 1692. The only bodies
							<pb n="483" id="vII483"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2496">
							<figDesc>Page 483.</figDesc>
						</figure> of men who fully came up to their duty on the occasion were the
						clergy of the county, and, as will appear, the church at Salem Village.</p>
					<p>What was done by the First Church in Salem is shown in the following extract
						from its records: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“March 2, 1712. — After the sacrament, a church-meeting was appointed to
							be at the teacher's house, at two of the clock in the afternoon, on the
							sixth of the month, being Thursday: on which day they accordingly met to
							consider of the several following particulars propounded to them by the
							teacher; viz.: —</p>
						<p>“1. Whether the record of the excommunication of our Sister Nurse (all
							things considered) may not be erased and blotted out. The result of
							which consideration was, That whereas, on July 3d, 1692, it was proposed
							by the Elders, and consented to by an unanimous vote of the church, that
							our Sister Nurse should be excommunicated, she being convicted of
							witchcraft by the Court, and she was accordingly excommunicated, since
							which the General Court having taken off the attainder, and the
							testimony on which she was convicted being not now so satisfactory to
							ourselves and others as it was generally in that hour of darkness and
							temptation; and we being solicited by her son, Mr. Samuel Nurse, to
							erase and blot out of the church records the sentence of her
							excommunication, — this church, having the matter proposed to them by
							the teacher, and having seriously considered it, doth consent that the
							record of our Sister Nurse's excommunication be accordingly erased and
							blotted out, that it may no longer be a reproach to her memory, and an
							occasion of grief to her children. Humbly requesting that the merciful
							God would pardon whatsoever sin, error, or mistake was in the
							application of that censure and of that whole affair, through our
							merciful High-priest, who knoweth how to have compassion on the
							ignorant, and those that are out of the way.</p>
						<p>“2. It was proposed whether the sentence of excommunication against our
							Brother Giles Corey (all things considered) may not be erased and
							blotted out. The result was, That whereas, on Sept. 18, 1692, it was
							considered by the church, that our Brother Giles Corey stood accused of
							and indicted for the sin of witchcraft, and that he had obstinately
							refused to plead, and so threw himself on certain death. It was agreed
							by the vote of the church, that he should be excommunicated for it; and
							accordingly he was excommunicated. Yet the church, having now testimony
							in his behalf, that, before his death, he did bitterly repent of his
							obstinate refusal to plead in defence <pb n="484" id="vII484"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2497">
								<figDesc>Page 484.</figDesc>
							</figure> of his life, do consent that the sentence of his
							excommunication be erased and blotted out.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>It will be noticed that these proceedings were not had at a regular public
						meeting, but at a private meeting of the church, on a week-day afternoon, at
						the teacher's house. The motives that led to them were a disposition to
						comply with the act of the General Court, and the solicitations of Mr.
						Samuel Nurse, rather than a profound sense of wrong done to a venerable
						member of their own body, who had claims upon their protection as such. The
						language of the record does not frankly admit absolutely that there was sin,
						error, or mistake, but requests forgiveness for whatsoever there may have
						been. The character of Rebecca Nurse, and the outrageous treatment she had
						received from that church, in the method arranged for her excommunication,
						demanded something more than these hypothetical expressions, with such a
						preamble.</p>
					<p>The statement made in the vote about Corey is, on its face, a
						misrepresentation. From the nature of the proceeding by which he was
						destroyed, it was in his power, at any moment, if he “repented of his
						obstinate refusal to plead,” by saying so, to be instantly released from the
						pressure that was crushing him. The only design of the torture was to make
						him bring it to an end by “answering” guilty, or not guilty. Somebody
						fabricated the slander that Corey's resolution broke down under his agonies,
						and that he bitterly repented; and Mr. Noyes put the foolish scandal upon
						the records of the church.</p>
					<p>The date of this transaction is disreputable to the people of Salem. Twenty
						years had been suffered to elapse, and a great outrage allowed to remain
						unacknowledged and unrepented. The credit of doing what was done at last
						probably belongs to the Rev. George Corwin. His call to the ministry, as
						colleague with Mr. Noyes, had just been consummated. The introduction of a
						new minister heralded a new policy, and the proceedings have the appearance
						of growing out of the kindly and auspicious feelings which generally attend
						and welcome such an era.</p>
					<p>The Rev. George, son of Jonathan Corwin, was born May 21, 1683, and graduated
						at Harvard College in 1701. Mr. Barnard, of Marblehead, describes his
						character: “The spirit of <pb n="485" id="vII485"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2498">
							<figDesc>Page 485.</figDesc>
						</figure> early devotion, accompanied with a natural freedom of thought and
						easy elocution, a quick invention, a solid judgment, and a tenacious memory,
						laid the foundation of a good preacher; to which his acquired literature,
						his great reading, hard studies, deep meditation, and close walk with God,
						rendered him an able and faithful minister of the New Testament.” The
						records of the First Church, in noticing his death, thus speak of him: “He
						was highly esteemed in his life, and very deservedly lamented at his death;
						having been very eminent for his early improvement in learning and piety,
						his singular abilities and great labors, his remarkable zeal and
						faithfulness. He was a great benefactor to our poor.” Those bearing the name
						of Curwen among us are his descendants. He died Nov. 23, 1717.</p>
					<p>The Rev. Nicholas Noyes died Dec. 13, 1717. He was a person of superior
						talents and learning. He published, with the sermon preached by Cotton
						Mather on the occasion, a poem on the death of his venerable colleague, Mr.
						Higginson, in 1708; and also a poem on the death of Rev. Joseph Green, in
						1715. Although an amiable and benevolent man in other respects, it cannot be
						denied that he was misled by his errors and his temperament into the most
						violent course in the witchcraft prosecutions; and it is to be feared that
						his feelings were never wholly rectified in reference to that
						transaction.</p>
					<p>Jonathan, the father of the Rev. George Corwin, and whose part as a
						magistrate and judge in the examinations and trials of 1692 has been seen,
						died on the 9th of July, 1718, seventy years of age.</p>
					<p>It only remains to record the course of the village church and people in
						reference to the events of 1692. After six persons, including Rebecca Nurse,
						had suffered death; and while five others, George Burroughs, John Procter,
						John Willard, George Jacobs, and Martha Carrier, were awaiting their
						execution, which was to take place on the coming Friday, Aug. 19, — the
						facts, related as follows by Mr. Parris in his record-book, occurred: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Sabbath-day, 14th August, 1692. — The church was stayed after the
							congregation was dismissed, and the pastor spake to the church after
							this manner: —</p>
						<p>“`Brethren, you may all have taken notice, that, several sacrament days
							past, our brother Peter Cloyse, and Samuel Nurse and his wife, <pb
								n="486" id="vII486"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2499">
								<figDesc>Page 486.</figDesc>
							</figure> and John Tarbell and his wife, have absented from communion
							with us at the Lord's Table, yea, have very rarely, except our brother
							Samuel Nurse, been with us in common public worship: now, it is needful
							that the church send some persons to them to know the reason of their
							absence. Therefore, if you be so minded, express yourselves.'</p>
						<p>“None objected. But a general or universal vote, after some discourse,
							passed, that Brother Nathaniel Putnam and the two deacons should join
							with the pastor to discourse with the said absenters about it.</p>
						<p>“31st August. — Brother Tarbell proves sick, unmeet for discourse;
							Brother Cloyse hard to be found at home, being often with his wife in
							prison at Ipswich for witchcraft; and Brother Nurse, and sometimes his
							wife, attends our public meeting, and he the sacrament, 11th September,
							1692: upon all which we choose to wait further.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>When it is remembered that the individuals aimed at all belonged to the
						family of Rebecca Nurse, whose execution had taken place three weeks before
						under circumstances with which Mr. Parris had been so prominently and
						responsibly connected, this proceeding must be felt by every person of
						ordinary human sensibilities to have been cruel, barbarous, and unnatural.
						Parris made the entry in his book, as he often did, some time after the
						transaction, as the inserted date of Sept. 11, shows. What his object was in
						commencing disciplinary treatment of this distressed family is not certain.
						It may be that he was preparing to get up such a feeling against them as
						would make it safe to have the “afflicted” cry out upon some of them. Or it
						may be that he wished to get them out of his church, to avoid the
						possibility of their proceeding against him, by ecclesiastical methods, at
						some future day. He could not, however, bring his church to continue the
						process. This is the first indication that the brethren were no longer to be
						relied on by him to go all lengths, and that some remnants of good feeling
						and good sense were to be found among them.</p>
					<p>But Mr. Parris was determined not to allow the public feeling against persons
						charged with witchcraft to subside, if he could help it; and he made one
						more effort to renew the vehemence of the prosecutions. He prepared and
						preached two sermons, on the 11th of September, from the text, Rev. xvii.
						14: “These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them:
						for he is <pb n="487" id="vII487"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2500">
							<figDesc>Page 487.</figDesc>
						</figure> Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are
						called and chosen and faithful.” They are entitled, “The Devil and his
						instruments will be warring against Christ and his followers.” this note is
						added, “After the condemnation of six witches at a court at Salem, one of
						the witches, viz., Martha Corey, in full communion with our church.” The
						following is a portion of “the improvement” in the application of these
						discourses: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“It may serve to reprove such as seem to be so amazed at the war the
							Devil has raised amongst us by wizards and witches, against the Lamb and
							his followers, that they altogether deny it. If ever there were witches,
							men and women in covenant with the Devil, here are multitudes in New
							England. Nor is it so strange a thing that there should be such; no, nor
							that some church-members should be such. Pious Bishop Hall saith, `The
							Devil's prevalency in this age is most clear in the marvellous number of
							witches abounding in all places. Now hundreds (says he) are discovered
							in one shire; and, if fame deceive us not, in a village of fourteen
							houses in the north are found so many of this damned brood. Heretofore,
							only barbarous deserts had them; but now the civilized and religious
							parts are frequently pestered with them. Heretofore, some silly,
							ignorant old woman, &amp;c.; but now we have known those of both sexes
							who professed much knowledge, holiness, and devotion, drawn into this
							damnable practice.”'</p>
					</q>
					<p>The foregoing extract is important as showing that some persons at the
						village had begun to express their disbelief of the witchcraft doctrine of
						Mr. Parris, “altogether denying it.” The title and drift of the sermons in
						connection with the date, and his proceedings, the month before, against
						Samuel Nurse, Tarbell, and Cloyse, members of his church, give color to the
						idea that he was designing to have them “cried out” against, and thus
						disposed of. It is a noticeable fact, that, about this time, Cotton Mather
						was also laying his plans for a renewal, or rather continuance, of
						witchcraft prosecutions. Nine days after these sermons were preached by
						Parris, Mather wrote the following letter to Stephen Sewall of Salem: —</p>

					<p>But that I may be the more capable to assist in lifting up a standard against
						the infernal enemy, I must renew my most importunate request, that you would
						please quickly to perform what you kindly promised, of giving me a narrative
						of the evidences given in at the trials of half a dozen, or if you please a

				<div2 id="d1e7758" type="section">

					<p>In order to understand the character and aim of this letter, it will be
						necessary to consider its date. It was written Sept. 20, 1692. On the 19th
						of August, but one month before, Dr. Mather <pb n="489" id="vII489"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2502">
							<figDesc>Page 489.</figDesc>
						</figure> was acting a conspicuous part under the gallows at Witch-hill, at
						the execution of Mr. Burroughs and four others, increasing the power of the
						awful delusion, and inflaming the passions of the people. On the 9th of
						September, six more miserable creatures received sentence of death. On the
						17th of September, nine more received sentence of death. On the 17th of
						September, Giles Cory was crushed to death. And, on the 22d of September,
						eight were executed. These were the last that suffered death. The letter,
						therefore, was written while the horrors of the transaction were at their
						height, and by a person who had himself been a witness of them, and whose
						“good hap” it had been to “do some little service” in promoting them. The
						object of the writer is declared to be, that he might be “more capable to
						assist in lifting up a standard against the infernal enemy.” The literal
						meaning of this expression is, that he might be enabled to get up another
						witchcraft delusion under his own special management and control. Can any
						thing be imagined more artful and dishonest than the plan he had contrived
						to keep himself out of sight in all the operations necessary to accomplish
						his purpose? “Nay, though I will never lay aside the character which I
						mentioned in my last words, yet I am willing, that, when you write, you
						should imagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate as any among
						us: address me as one that believed nothing reasonable; and when you have so
						knocked me down, in a spectre so unlike me, you will enable me to box it
						about among my neighbors, till it come — I know not where at last.”</p>
					<p>Upon obtaining the document requisite to the fulfilment of his design, he did
						“box it about” so effectually among his neighbors, that he succeeded that
						next summer in getting up a wonderful case of witchcraft, in the person of
						one Margaret Rule, a member of his congregation in Boston. Dr. Mather
						published an account of her long-continued fastings, even unto the ninth
						day, and of the incredible sufferings she endured from the “infernal enemy.”
						“She was thrown,” says he, “into such exorbitant convulsions as were
						astonishing to the spectators in general. They that could behold the doleful
						condition of the poor family without sensible compassions might have
						entrails, indeed, but I am sure they could have no true bowels in them.” So
						far was he successful in spreading the delusion, that he prevailed upon six
						men to testify <pb n="490" id="vII490"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2503">
							<figDesc>Page 490.</figDesc>
						</figure> that they had seen Margaret Rule lifted bodily from her bed, and
						raised by an invisible power “so as to touch the garret floor;” that she was
						entirely removed from the bed or any other material support; that she
						continued suspended for several minutes; and that a strong man, assisted by
						several other persons, could not effectually resist the mysterious force
						that lifted her up, and poised her aloft in the air! The people of Boston
						were saved from the horrors intended to be brought upon them by this dark
						and deep-laid plot, by the activity, courage, and discernment of Calef and
						others, who distrusted Dr. Mather, and, by watching his movements, exposed
						the imposture, and overthrew the whole design.</p>
					<p>Mr. Parris does not appear to have produced much effect by his sermons. The
						people had suffered enough from the “war between the Devil and the Lamb,” as
						he and Mather had conducted it; and it could not be renewed.</p>
					<p>Immediately upon the termination of the witchcraft proceedings, the
						controversy between Mr. Parris and the congregation, or the inhabitants, as
						they were called, of the village, was renewed, with earnest resolution on
						their part to get rid of him. The parish neglected and refused to raise the
						means for paying his salary; and a majority of the voters, in the meetings
						of the “inhabitants,” vigilantly resisted all attempts in his favor. The
						church was still completely under his influence; and, as has been stated in
						the First Part, he made use of that body to institute a suit against the
						people. The court and magistrates were wholly in his favor, and peremptorily
						ordered the appointment, by the people, of a new committee. The inhabitants
						complied with the order by the election of a new committee, but took care to
						have it composed exclusively of men opposed to Mr. Parris; and he found
						himself no better off than before. He concluded not to employ his church any
						longer as a principal agent in his lawsuit against the parish; but used it
						for another purpose.</p>
					<p>After the explosion of the witchcraft delusion, the relations of parties
						became entirely changed. The prosecutors at the trials were put on the
						defensive, and felt themselves in peril. Parris saw his danger, and, with
						characteristic courage and fertility of resources, prepared to defend
						himself, and carry the war upon any quarter from which an attack might be
						apprehended. He <pb n="491" id="vII491"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2504">
							<figDesc>Page 491.</figDesc>
						</figure> continued, on his own responsibility, to prosecute, in court, his
						suit against the parish, and in his usual trenchant style. As the law then
						was, a minister, in a controversy with his parish, had a secure advantage,
						and absolutely commanded the situation, if his church were with him. From
						the time of his settlement, Parris had shaped his policy on this basis. He
						had sought to make his church an impregnable fortress against his opponents.
						But, to be impregnable, it was necessary that there should be no enemies
						within it. A few disaffected brethren could at any time demand, and have a
						claim to, a mutual council; and Mr. Parris knew, that, before the
						investigations of such a council, his actions in the witchcraft prosecutions
						could not stand. This perhaps suggested his movements, in August, 1692,
						against Samuel Nurse, John Tarbell, and Peter Cloyse. He did not at that
						time succeed in getting rid of them; and they remained in the church, and,
						with the exception of Cloyse, in the village. They might at any time take
						the steps that would lead to a mutual council; and Mr. Parris was
						determined, at all events, to prevent that. It was evident that the members
						of that family would insist upon satisfaction being given them, in and
						through the church, for the wrongs he had done them. Although, in the
						absence of Cloyse, but two in number, there was danger that sympathy for
						them might reach others of the brethren. Thomas Wilkins, a member in good
						standing, son of old Bray Wilkins, and a connection of John Willard, an
						intelligent and resolute man, had already joined them. Parris felt that
						others might follow, and that whatever could be done to counteract them must
						be done quickly. He accordingly initiated proceedings in his church to rid
						himself of them, if not by excommunication, at least by getting them under
						discipline, so as to prevent the possibility of their dealing with him.</p>
					<p>This led to one of the most remarkable passages of the kind in the annals of
						the New-England churches. It is narrated in detail by Mr. Parris, in his
						church record-book. It would not be easy to find anywhere an example of
						greater skill, wariness, or ability in a conflict of this sort. On the one
						side is Mr. Parris, backed by his church and the magistrates, and aided, it
						is probable, by Mr. Noyes; on the other, three husbandmen. They had no known
						backers or advisers; and, at frequent stages of the fencing match, had to
						parry or strike, without time to consult any <pb n="492" id="vII492"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2505">
							<figDesc>Page 492.</figDesc>
						</figure> one. Mr. Parris was ingenious, quick, a great strategist, and not
						over-scrupulous as to the use of his weapons. Nurse, Tarbell, and Wilkins
						were cautious, cool, steady, and persistent. Of course, they were wholly
						inexperienced in such things, and liable to make wrong moves, or to be
						driven or drawn to untenable ground. But they will not be found, I think, to
						have taken a false step from beginning to end. Their line of action was
						extremely narrow. It was necessary to avoid all personalities, and every
						appearance of passion or excitement; to make no charge against Mr. Parris
						that could touch the church, as such, or reflect upon the courts,
						magistrates, or any others that had taken part in the prosecutions. It was
						necessary to avoid putting any thing into writing, with their names
						attached, which could in any way be tortured into a libel. Parris lets fall
						expressions which show that he was on the watch for something of the kind to
						seize upon, to transfer the movement from the church to the courts. Entirely
						unaccustomed to public speaking, these three farmers had to meet assemblages
						composed of their opponents, and much wrought up against them; to make
						statements, and respond to interrogatories and propositions, the full and
						ultimate bearing of which was not always apparent: any unguarded expression
						might be fatal to their cause. Their safety depended upon using the right
						word at the right time and in the right manner, and in withholding the
						statement of their grievances, in adequate force of language, until they
						were under the shelter of a council. If, during the long-protracted
						conferences and communications, they had tripped at any point, allowed a
						phrase or syllable to escape which might be made the ground of discipline or
						censure, all would be lost; for Parris could not be reached but through a
						council, and a council could not even be asked for except by brethren in
						full and clear standing. It was often attempted to ensnare them into making
						charges against the church; but they kept their eye on Parris, and, as they
						told him more than once in the presence of the whole body of the people, on
						him alone. Limited as the ground was on which they could stand, they held it
						steadfastly, and finally drove him from his stronghold.</p>
					<p>On the first movement of Mr. Parris offensively upon them, they commenced
						their movement upon him. The method by which alone they could proceed,
						according to ecclesiastical law <pb n="493" id="vII493"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2506">
							<figDesc>Page 493.</figDesc>
						</figure> and the platform of the churches, was precisely as it was
						understood to be laid down in Matt. xviii. 15-17. Following these
						directions, Samuel Nurse first called alone upon Mr. Parris, and privately
						made known his grievances. Parris gave him no satisfaction. Then, after a
						due interval, Nurse, Tarbell, and Wilkins called upon him together. He
						refused to see them together, but one at a time was allowed to go up into
						his study. Tarbell and Nurse each spent an hour or more with him, leaving no
						time for Wilkins. In these interviews, he not only failed to give
						satisfaction, but, according to his own account, treated them in the coolest
						and most unfeeling manner, not allowing himself to utter a soothing word,
						but actually reiterating his belief of the guilt of their mother; telling
						them, as he says, “that he had not seen sufficient grounds to vary his
						opinion.” Cloyse came soon after to the village, and had an interview with
						him for the same purpose. Parris saw them one only at a time, in order to
						preclude their taking the second step required by the gospel rule; that is,
						to have a brother of the church with them as a witness. He also took the
						ground that they could not be witnesses for each other, but that he should
						treat them all as only one person in the transaction. A sense of the
						injustice of his conduct, or some other consideration, led William Way,
						another of the brethren, to go with them as a witness. Nurse, Tarbell,
						Wilkins, Cloyse, and Way went to his house together. He said that the four
						first were but one person in the case; but admitted that Way was a distinct
						person, a brother of accredited standing, and a witness. He escaped,
						however, under the subterfuge that the gospel rule required “two or <hi
							rend="italics">three</hi> witnesses.” In this way, the matter stood for
						some time; Parris saying that they had not complied with the conditions in
						Matt. xviii., and they maintaining that they had.</p>
					<p>The course of Parris was fast diminishing his hold upon the public
						confidence. It was plain that the disaffected brethren had done what they
						could, in an orderly way, to procure a council. At length, the leading
						clergymen here and in Boston, whose minds were open to reason, thought it
						their duty to interpose their advice. They wrote to Parris, that he and his
						church ought to consent to a council. They wrote a second time in stronger
						terms. Not daring to quarrel with so large a portion of the clergy, Parris
						pretended to comply with their advice, but demanded a majority of the
						council <pb n="494" id="vII494"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2507">

						</figure> to be chosen by him and his church. The disaffected brethren
						insisted upon a fair, mutual council; each party to have three ministers,
						with their delegates, in it. To this, Parris had finally to agree. The
						dissatisfied brethren named, as one of their three, a church at Ipswich.
						Parris objected to the Ipswich church. The dissenting brethren insisted that
						each side should be free to select its respective three churches. Parris was
						not willing to have Ipswich in the council. The other party insisted, and
						here the matter hung suspended. The truth is, that the disaffected brethren
						were resolved to have the Rev. John Wise in the council. They knew Cotton
						Mather would be there, on the side of Parris; and they knew that John Wise
						was the man to meet him. The public opinion settled down in favor of the
						dissatisfied brethren, on the ground that each party to a mutual council
						ought to — and, to make it really mutual, must — have free and full power to
						nominate the churches to be called by it. Parris, being afraid to have a
						mutual council, and particularly if Mr. Wise was in it, suddenly took a new
						position. He and his church called an <foreign lang="unknown" rend="italics"
							>ex parte</foreign> council, at which the following ministers, with
						their delegates, were present: Samuel Checkley of the New South Church,
						James Allen of the First Church, Samuel Willard of the Old South, Increase
						and Cotton Mather of the North Church, — all of Boston; Samuel Torrey of
						Weymouth; Samuel Phillips of Rowley, and Edward Payson, also of Rowley.
						Among the delegates were many of the leading public men of the province. The
						Result was essentially damaging to Mr. Parris. The tide was now strongly set
						against him. The Boston ministers advised him to withdraw from the contest.
						They provided a settlement for him in Connecticut, and urged him to quit the
						village, and go there. But he refused, and prolonged the struggle. In the
						course of it, papers were drawn up and signed, one by his friends, another
						by his opponents, together embracing nearly all the men and women of the
						village. Those who did not sign either paper were understood to sympathize
						with the disaffected brethren. Many who signed the paper favorable to him
						acted undoubtedly from the motive stated in the heading; viz., that the
						removal of Mr. Parris could do no good, “for we have had three ministers
						removed already, and by every removal our differences have been rather
						aggravated.” Another removal, they thought, would utterly ruin them. They
							<pb n="495" id="vII495"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2508">
							<figDesc>Page 495.</figDesc>
						</figure> do not express any particular interest in Mr. Parris, but merely
						dread another change. They preferred to bear the ills they had, rather than
						fly to others that they knew not of. It is a very significant fact, that
						neither Mrs. Ann Putnam nor the widow Sarah Houlton signed either paper (the
						Sarah Houlton whose name appears was the wife of Joseph Houlton, Sr.). There
						is reason to believe that they regretted the part they had taken,
						particularly against Rebecca Nurse, and probably did not feel over favorably
						to the person who had led them into their dreadful responsibility.</p>
					<p>In the mean time, the controversy continued to wax warm among the people. Mr.
						Parris was determined to hold his place, and, with it, the parsonage and
						ministry lands. The opposition was active, unappeasable, and effective. The
						following paper, handed about, illustrates the methods by which they
						assailed him: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“As to the contest between Mr. Parris and his hearers, &amp;c., it may be
							composed by a satisfactory answer to Lev. xx. 6: `And the soul that
							turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go
							a-whoring after them, I will set my face against that soul, and will cut
							him off from among his people.' 1 Chron. x. 13, 14: `So Saul died for
							his transgression which he committed against the Lord, — even against
							the word of the Lord, which he kept not, — and also for asking counsel
							of one who had a familiar to inquire of it, and inquired not of the
							Lord: therefore he slew him,”' &amp;c.</p>
					</q>
					<p>Mr. Parris mirrored, or rather daguerrotyped, his inmost thoughts upon the
						page of his church record-book. Whatever feeling happened to exercise his
						spirit, found expression there. This gives it a truly rare and singular
						interest. Among a variety of scraps variegating the record, and thrown in
						with other notices of deaths, he has the following: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“1694, Oct. 27. — Ruth, daughter to Job Swinnerton (died), and buried the
							28th instant, being the Lord's Day; and the corpse carried by the
							meeting-house door in time of singing before meeting afternoon, and more
							at the funeral than at the sermon.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>This illustrates the state of things. The Swinnerton family were all along
						opposed to Mr. Parris, and kept remarkably clear from the witchcraft
						delusion. Originally, it was not customary to have prayers at funerals. At
						any rate, all that Mr. Parris had to do on the occasion was to witness and
						record the fact, which he <pb n="496" id="vII496"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2509">
							<figDesc>Page 496.</figDesc>
						</figure> indites in the pithy manner in which he often relieves his mind,
						that more people went to the distant burial-ground than came to hear him
						preach. The procession was made up of his opponents; the congregation, of
						his friends. At last, Captain John Putnam proposed that each party should
						choose an equal number from themselves to decide the controversy; and that
						Major Bartholomew Gedney, from the town, should be invited to act as
						moderator of the joint meeting. Both sides agreed, and appointed their
						representatives. Major Gedney consented to preside. But this movement came
						to nothing, probably owing to the refractoriness of Mr. Parris; for, from
						that moment, he had no supporters. The church ceased to act: its members
						were merged in the meeting of the inhabitants. There was no longer any
						division among them. The party that had acted as friends of Mr. Parris
						united thenceforward with his opponents to defend the parish in the suit he
						had brought against it in the courts. The controversy was quite protracted.
						The Court was determined to uphold him, and expressed its prejudice against
						the parish, sometimes with considerable severity of manner and action.<note

						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>The parish heeded not the frowns of the Court, but persisted inexorably in
						its purpose to get rid of Mr. Parris. After an obstinate contest, it
						prevailed. In the last stage of the controversy, it appointed four men, as
						its agents or attorneys, whose names indicate the spirit in which it acted,
						— John Tarbell, Samuel Nurse, Daniel Andrew, and Joseph Putnam. His
						dauntless son did not follow the wolf through the deep and dark recesses of
						his den with a more determined resolution than that with which Joseph Putnam
						pursued Samuel Parris through the windings of the law, until he ferreted him
						out, and rid the village of him for ever.</p>
					<p>Finally, the inferior court of Common Pleas, before which Mr. Parris had
						carried the case, ordered that the matters in controversy between him and
						the inhabitants of Salem Village should be referred to arbitrators for
						decision. The following statement was laid before them by the persons
						representing the inhabitants: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“<hi rend="italics">To the Honorable Wait Winthrop, Elisha Cook, and
								Samuel Sewall, Esquires, Arbitrators, indifferently chosen, between

								to hear Mr. Parris, nor to own him as a Minister of the Gospel, nor
								to contribute any Support to him as such for several years past,
								humbly offered as fit for consideration.</hi></p>
						<p>“We humbly conceive that, having, in April, 1693, given our reasons why
							we could not join with Mr. Parris in prayer, preaching, or sacrament, if
							these reasons are found sufficient for our withdrawing (and we cannot
							yet find but they are), then we conceive ourselves virtually discharged,
							not only in conscience, but also in law, which requires <pb n="498"
								id="vII498"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2511">
								<figDesc>Page 498.</figDesc>
							</figure> maintenance to be given to such as are orthodox and blameless;
							the said Mr. Parris having been teaching such dangerous errors, and
							preached such scandalous immoralities, as ought to discharge any (though
							ever so gifted otherways) from the work of the ministry, particularly in
							his oath against the lives of several, wherein he swears that the
							prisoners with their looks knock down those pretended sufferers. We
							humbly conceive that he that swears to more than he is certain of, is
							equally guilty of perjury with him that swears to what is false. And
							though they did fall at such a time, yet it could not be known that they
							did it, much less could they be certain of it; yet did swear positively
							against the lives of such as he could not have any knowledge but they
							might be innocent.</p>
						<p>“His believing the Devil's accusations, and readily departing from all
							charity to persons, though of blameless and godly lives, upon such
							suggestions; his promoting such accusations; as also his partiality
							therein in stifling the accusations of some, and, at the same time,
							vigilantly promoting others, — as we conceive, are just causes for our
							refusal, &amp;c.</p>
						<p>“That Mr. Parris's going to Mary Walcot or Abigail Williams, and
							directing others to them, to know who afflicted the people in their
							illnesses, — we understand this to be a dealing with them that have a
							familiar spirit, and an implicit denying the providence of God, who
							alone, as we believe, can send afflictions, or cause devils to afflict
							any: this we also conceive sufficient to justify such refusal.</p>
						<p>“That Mr. Parris, by these practices and principles, has been the
							beginner and procurer of the sorest afflictions, not to this village
							only, but to this whole country, that did ever befall them.</p>
						<p>“We, the subscribers, in behalf of ourselves, and of several others of
							the same mind with us (touching these things), having some of us had our
							relations by these practices taken off by an untimely death; others have
							been imprisoned and suffered in our persons, reputations, and estates, —
							submit the whole to your honors' decision, to determine whether we are
							or ought to be any ways obliged to honor, respect, and support such an

					<p>The arbitrators decided that the inhabitants should pay to Mr. Parris a
						certain amount for arrearages, and also the sum of ¥79. 9<hi rend="italics"
							>s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> for all his right and interest in
						the ministry house and land, and that he be forthwith dismissed; and his
						ministerial relation to the church and society in Salem Village dissolved.
						The parish raised the money with great alacrity. Nathaniel Ingersol, who
						had, as has been stated, made him a present at his settlement of a valuable
						piece of land adjoining the parsonage grounds, bought it back, paying him a
						liberal price for it, fully equal to its value; and he left the place, so
						far as appears, for ever.</p>
					<p>On the 14th of July, 1696, in the midst of his controversy with his people,
						his wife died. She was an excellent woman; and was respected and lamented by
						all. He caused a stone slab to be placed at the head of her grave, with a
						suitable inscription, still plainly legible, concluding with four lines, to
						which his initials are appended, composed by him, of which this is one:
						“Farewell, best wife, choice mother, neighbor, friend.” Her ashes rest in
						what is called the Wadsworth burial ground.</p>
					<p>Mr. Parris removed to Newton, then to Concord; and in November, 1697, began
						to preach at Stow, on a salary of forty pounds, half in money and half in
						provisions, &amp;c. A grant from the general court was relied upon from year
						to year to help to make up the twenty pounds to be paid in money. Afterwards
						he preached at Dunstable, partly supported by a grant from the general
						court, and finally in Sudbury, where he died, Feb. 27, 1720. His daughter
						Elizabeth, who belonged, it will be remembered, to the circle of “afflicted
						children” in 1692, then nine years of age, in 1710 married Benjamin Barnes
						of Concord. Two other daughters married in Sudbury. His son Noyes, who
						graduated at Harvard College in 1721, became deranged, and was supported by
						the town. His other son Samuel was long deacon of the church at Sudbury, and
						died Nov. 22, 1792, aged ninety years.</p>
					<p>In the “Boston News Letter,” No. 1433, July 15, 1731, is a notice, as
						follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Any person or persons who knew Mr. Samuel Parris, formerly of Barbadoes,
							afterwards of Boston in New England, merchant, and after that minister
							of Salem Village, &amp;c., deceased to be a son of Thomas Parris of the
							island aforesaid, Esq. who deceased 1673, or <pb n="500" id="vII500"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2513">
								<figDesc>Page 500.</figDesc>
							</figure> sole heir by will to all his estate in said island, are
							desired to give or send notice thereof to the printer of this paper; and
							it shall be for their advantage.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>Whether the identity of Mr. Parris, of Salem Village, with the son of Thomas
						Parris, of Barbadoes, was established, we have no information. If it was,
						some relief may have come to his descendants. There is every reason to
						believe, that, after leaving the village, he and his family suffered from
						extremely limited means, if not from absolute poverty. The general
						ill-repute brought upon him by his conduct in the witchcraft prosecutions
						followed him to the last. He had forfeited the sympathy of his clerical
						brethren by his obstinate refusal to take their advice. They earnestly, over
						and over again, expostulated against his prolonging the controversy with the
						people of Salem Village, besought him to relinquish it, and promised him, if
						he would, to provide an eligible settlement elsewhere. They actually did
						provide one. But he rejected their counsels and persuasions, in expressions
						of ill-concealed bitterness. So that, when he was finally driven away, they
						felt under no obligations to befriend him; and with his eminent abilities he
						<unclear/> out a precarious and inadequate maintenance for himself and
						family, in feeble settlements in outskirt towns, during the rest of his
						days.</p>
					<p>It is difficult to describe the character of this unfortunate man. Just as is
						the condemnation which facts compel history to pronounce, I have a feeling
						of relief in the thought, that, before the tribunal to which he so long ago
						passed, the mercy we all shall need, which comprehends all motives and
						allows for all infirmities, has been extended to him, in its infinite wisdom
						and benignity.</p>
					<p>He was a man of uncommon abilities, of extraordinary vivacity and activity of
						intellect. He does not appear to have been wilfully malevolent; although
						somewhat reckless in a contest, he was not deliberately untruthful; on the
						contrary, there is in his statements a singular ingenuousness and fairness,
						seldom to be found in a partisan, much more seldom in a principal. Although
						we get almost all we know of the examinations of accused parties in the
						witchcraft proceedings, and of his long contentions with his parish, from
						him, there is hardly any ground to regret that the parties on the other side
						had no friends to tell their story. A transparency <pb n="501" id="vII501"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2514">
							<figDesc>Page 501.</figDesc>
						</figure> of character, a sort of instinctive incontinency of mind, which
						made him let out every thing, or a sort of blindness which prevented his
						seeing the bearings of what was said and done, make his reports the vehicles
						of the materials for the defence of the very persons he was prosecuting. I
						know of no instance like it. His style is lucid, graphic, lively, natural to
						the highest degree; and whatever he describes, we see the whole, and, as it
						were, from all points of view. Language flowed from his pen with a facility,
						simplicity, expressiveness, and accuracy, not surpassed or often equalled.
						He wrote as men talk, using colloquial expressions without reserve, but
						always to the point. When we read, we hear him; abbreviating names, and
						clipping words, as in the most familiar and unguarded conversation. He was
						not hampered by fear of offending the rules which some think necessary to
						dignify composition. In his off-hand, free and easy, gossiping entries in
						the church-book, or in his carefully prepared productions, like the
						“Meditations for Peace,” read before his church and the dissatisfied
						brethren, we have specimens of plain good English, in its most translucent
						and effective forms. Considering that his academic education was early
						broken off, and many intermediate years were spent in commercial pursuits,
						his learning and attainments are quite remarkable. The various troubles and
						tragic mischiefs of his life, the terrible wrongs he inflicted on others,
						and the retributions he brought upon himself, are traccable to two or three
						peculiarities in his mental and moral organization.</p>
					<p>He had a passion for a scene, a ceremony, an excitement. He delighted in the
						exercise of power, and rejoiced in conflicts or commotions, from the
						exhilaration they occasioned, and the opportunity they gave for the
						gratification of the activity of his nature. He pursued the object of
						getting possession of the ministry house and land with such desperate
						pertinacity, not, I think, from avaricious motives, but for the sake of the
						power it would give him as a considerable landholder. His love of form and
						public excitement led him to operate as he did with his church. He kept it
						in continual action during the few years of his ministry. He had at least
						seventy-five special meetings of that body, without counting those which
						probably occurred without number, but of which there is no record, during
						the six months of the witchcraft period. Twice, the brethren gave out,
						wholly exhausted; and the powers <pb n="502" id="vII502"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2515">
							<figDesc>Page 502.</figDesc>
						</figure> of the church were, by vote, transferred to a special committee,
						to act in its behalf, composed of persons who had time and strength to
						spare. But Mr. Parris, never weary of excitement, would have been delighted
						to preside over church-meetings, and to be a participator in vehement
						proceedings, every day of his life. The more noisy and heated the
						contention, the more he enjoyed it. During all the transactions connected
						with the witchcraft prosecutions, he was everywhere present, always wide
						awake, full of animation, if not cheerfulness, and ready to take any part to
						carry them on. These propensities and dispositions were fraught with danger,
						and prolific of evil in his case, in consequence of what looks very much
						like a total want in himself of many of the natural human sensibilities, and
						an inability to apprehend them in others. Through all the horrors of the
						witchcraft prosecutions, he never evinced the slightest sensibility, and
						never seemed to be aware that anybody else had any. It was not absolute
						cruelty, but the absence of what may be regarded as a natural sense. It was
						not a positive wickedness, but a negative defect. He seemed to be surprised
						that other people had sentiments, and could not understand why Tarbell and
						Nurse felt so badly about the execution of their mother. He told them to
						their faces, without dreaming of giving them offence, that, while they
						thought she was innocent, and he thought she was guilty and had been justly
						put to death, it was a mere difference of opinion, as about an indifferent
						matter. In his “Meditations for Peace,” presented to these dissatisfied
						brethren, for the purpose and with an earnest desire of appeasing them, he
						tells them that the indulgence of such feelings at all is a yielding to
						“temptation,” being under “the clouds of human weakness,” and “a bewraying
						of remaining corruption.” Indeed, the theology of that day, it must be
						allowed, bore very hard upon even the best and most sacred affections of our
						nature. The council, in their Result, allude to the feelings of those whose
						parents, and other most loved and honored relatives and connections, had
						been so cruelly torn from them and put to death, as “infirmities discovered
						by them in such an heart-breaking day,” and bespeak for their grief and
						lamentations a charitable construction. They ask the church, whose hands
						were red with the blood of their innocent and dearest friends, not to pursue
						them with “more critical and vigorous proceedings” in consequence of their
						exhibiting these <pb n="503" id="vII503"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2516">
							<figDesc>Page 503.</figDesc>
						</figure> natural sensibilities on the occasion, but “to treat them with
						bowels of much compassion.” These views had taken full effect upon Mr.
						Parris, and obliterated from his breast all such “infirmities.” This is the
						only explanation or apology that can be made for him.</p>
					<p>Of the history of Cotton Mather, subsequently to the witchcraft prosecutions,
						and more or less in consequence of his agency in them, it may be said that
						the residue of his life was doomed to disappointment, and imbittered by
						reproach and defeat. The storm of fanatical delusion, which he doubted not
						would carry him to the heights of clerical and spiritual power, in America
						and everywhere, had left him a wreck. His political aspirations, always one
						of his strongest passions, were wholly blasted; and the great aim and crown
						of his ambition, the Presidency of Harvard College, once and again and for
						ever had eluded his grasp. I leave him to tell his story, and reveal the
						state of his mind and heart in his own most free and full expressions from
						his private diary for the year 1724.</p>

						Rev. Benjamin Colman, pastor of the Brattle Church in Boston, to the vacant
						presidential chair. He declined the appointment. The question hung in
						suspense another six months. In June, 1725, the Rev. Benjamin Wadsworth,
						pastor of the First Church in Boston, was elected, accepted the office, and
						held it to his death, on the 16th of March, 1737. It may easily be imagined
						how keenly these repeated slights were felt by Cotton Mather. He died on the
						13th of February, 1728.</p>
					<p>From the early part of the spring of 1695, when the abortive attempt to
						settle the difficulty between Mr. Parris and the people of the village, by
						the umpirage of Major Gedney, was made, it evidently became the settled
						purpose of the leading men, on both sides, to restore harmony to the place.
						On all committees, persons who had been prominent in opposition to each
						other were joined together, that, thus co-operating, they might become
						reconciled. <pb n="506" id="vII506"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2519">
							<figDesc>Page 506.</figDesc>
						</figure> This is strikingly illustrated in the “seating of the
						meeting-house,” as it was called. In 1699, in a seat accommodating three
						persons, John Putnam the son of Nathaniel, and John Tarbell, were two of the
						three. Another seat for three was occupied by James and John Putnam, sons of
						John, and by Thomas Wilkins. Thomas Putnam and Samuel Nurse were placed in
						the same seat; and so were the wives of Thomas Putnam and Samuel Nurse, and
						the widow Sarah Houlton. The widow Preston, daughter of Rebecca Nurse, was
						seated with the widow Walcot, mother of Mary, one of the accusing girls.</p>
					<p>We see in this the effect of the wise and decisive course adopted by Mr.
						Parris's successor, the Rev. Joseph Green. Immediately upon his ordination,
						Nov. 10, 1698, he addressed himself in earnest to the work of reconciliation
						in that distracted parish. From the date of its existence, nearly thirty
						years before, it had been torn by constant strife. It had just passed
						through scenes which had brought all hearts into the most terrible
						alienation. A man of less faith would not have believed it possible, that
						the horrors and outrages of those scenes could ever be forgotten, forgiven,
						or atoned for, by those who had suffered or committed the wrongs. But he
						knew the infinite power of the divine love, which, as a minister of Christ,
						it was his office to inspire and diffuse. He knew that, with the blessing of
						God, that people, who had from the first been devouring each other, and upon
						whose garments the stain of the blood of brethren and sisters was fresh,
						might be made “kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another,
						even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven” them. In this heroic and
						Christ-like faith, he entered upon and steadfastly adhered to his divine
						work. He pursued it with patience, wisdom, and courageous energy. No
						ministry in the whole history of the New-England churches has had a more
						difficult task put upon it, and none has more perfectly succeeded in its
						labors. I shall describe the administration of this good man, as a minister
						of reconciliation, in his own words, transcribed from his church records:

							preparation for the sacrament of the Lord's Supper), at John Putnam,
							Jr.'s, after the exercise, I desired the church to manifest, by the
							usual sign, that they were so cordially satisfied with their brethren,
							Thomas Wilkins, John Tarbell, and Samuel Nurse, that they were heartily
								<pb n="507" id="vII507"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2520">
								<figDesc>Page 507.</figDesc>
							</figure> desirous that they would join with us in all ordinances, that
							so we might all live lovingly together. This they consented unto, and
							none made any objection, but voted it by lifting up their hands. And
							further, that whatever articles they had drawn up against these brethren
							formerly, they now looked upon them as nothing, but let them fall to the
							ground, being willing that they should be buried for ever.</p>
						<p>“Feb. 5, 1699. — This day, also our brother John Tarbell, and his wife,
							and Thomas Wilkins and his wife, and Samuel Nurse's wife, joined with us
							in the Lord's Supper; which is a matter of thankfulness, seeing they
							have for a long time been so offended as that they could not comfortably
							join with us.</p>
						<p>“1702. — In December, the pastor spake to the church, on the sabbath, as
							followeth: `Brethren, I find in your church-book a record of Martha
							Corey's being excommunicated for witchcraft; and, the generality of the
							land being sensible of the errors that prevailed in that day, some of
							her friends have moved me several times to propose to the church whether
							it be not our duty to recall that sentence, that so it may not stand
							against her to all generations; and I myself being a stranger to her,
							and being ignorant of what was alleged against her, I shall now only
							leave it to your consideration, and shall determine the matter by a vote
							the next convenient opportunity.</p>
						<p>“Feb. 14, 170⅔. — The major part of the brethren consented to the
							following: `Whereas this church passed a vote, Sept. 11, 1692, for the
							excommunication of Martha Corey, and that sentence was pronounced
							against her Sept. 14, by Mr. Samuel Parris, formerly the pastor of this
							church; she being, before her excommunication, condemned, and afterwards
							executed, for supposed witchcraft; and there being a record of this in
							our church-book, page 12, we being moved hereunto, do freely consent and
							heartily desire that the same sentence may be revoked, and that it may
							stand no longer against her; for we are, through God's mercy to us,
							convinced that we were at that dark day under the power of those errors
							which then prevailed in the land; and we are sensible that we had not
							sufficient grounds to think her guilty of that crime for which she was
							condemned and executed; and that her excommunication was not according
							to the mind of God, and therefore we desire that this may be entered in
							our church-book, to take off that odium that is cast on her name, and
							that so God may forgive our sin, and may be atoned for the land; and we
							humbly pray that God will not leave us any more to such errors and sins,
							but will teach and enable us always to do that which is right in his
							sight.'</p>

					</p>
					<p>The First Church in Salem rescinded its votes of excommunication of Rebecca
						Nurse and Giles Corey, in March, 1712. The church at the village was nearly
						ten years before it, in this act of justice to itself and to the memory of
						the injured dead. Mr. Green did not wait until the public sentiment drove
						him to it. He regarded it as his duty to lead, and keep in front of that
						sentiment, in the right direction. He did not wait until everybody demanded
						it to be done, but instantly began to prepare his people for it. At the
						proper time, he gave notice that he was about to bring the question before
						them; and he accordingly did so. He had no idea of allowing a few
						narrow-minded, obstinate individuals to keep the blot any longer upon the
						records of his church. His conduct is honorable to his name, and to the name
						of the village. By wise, prudent, but persistent efforts, he gradually
						repaired every breach, brought his parish out from under reproach, and set
						them right with each other, with the obligations of justice, and with the
						spirit of Christianity. It is affecting to read his ejaculations of praise
						and gratitude to God for every symptom of the prevalence of harmony and love
						among the people of his charge.</p>
					<p>The man who extinguished the fires of passion in a community that had ever
						before been consumed by them deserves to be held in lasting honor. The
						history of the witchcraft delusion in Salem Village would, indeed, be
						imperfectly written, if it failed to present the character of him who healed
						its wounds, obliterated the traces of its malign influence on the hearts and
						lives of those who acted, and repaired the wrongs done to the memory of
						those who suffered, in it. Joseph Green had a manly and amiable nature. He
						was a studious scholar and an able preacher. He was devoted to his ministry
						and faithful to its obligations. He was a leader of his people, and shared
						in their occupations and experiences. He was active in the ordinary
						employments of life and daily concerns of society. Possessed of independent
						property, he was frugal and simple in his habits, and liberal in the use of
						his means. The parsonage, while he lived in it, was the abode of
						hospitality, and frequented by the best society in the neighborhood. By
						mingled firmness and kindliness, he met and removed difficulties. He had a
						cheerful temperament, was not irritated by the course of events, even when
						of an unpleasant character. While Mr. Noyes was disturbed, even to
						resentment, by encroachments upon his parish, <pb n="509" id="vII509"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2522">

						</figure> in the formation of new societies in the middle precinct of Salem,
						now South Danvers, and in the second precinct of Beverly, now Upper Beverly,
						Mr. Green, although they drew away from him as many as from Mr. Noyes, went
						to participate in the raising of their meeting-houses. Of a genial
						disposition, he countenanced innocent amusements. He was fond of the sports
						of the field. The catamount was among the trophies of his sure aim, and he
						came home with his huntsman's bag filled with wild pigeons. He would take
						his little sons before and behind him on his horse, and spend a day with
						them fishing and fowling on Wilkins's Pond; and, when Indians threatened the
						settlements, he would shoulder his musket, join the brave young men of his
						parish, and be the first in the encounter, and the last to relinquish the
						pursuit of the savage foe.</p>
					<p>He was always, everywhere, a peacemaker; by his genial manner, and his
						genuine dignity and decision of character, he removed dissensions from his
						church and neighborhood, and secured the respect while he won the love of
						all. That such a person was raised up and placed where he was at that time,
						was truly a providence of God.</p>
					<p>The part performed in the witchcraft tragedy by the extraordinary child of
						twelve years of age, Ann Putnam, has been fully set forth. As has been
						stated, both her parents (and no one can measure their share of
						responsibility, nor that of others behind them, for her conduct) died within
						a fortnight of each other, in 1699. She was then nineteen years of age; a
						large family of children, all younger than herself, was left with her in the
						most melancholy orphanage. How many there were, we do not exactly know:
						eight survived her. Although their uncles, Edward and Joseph, were near, and
						kind, and able to care for them, the burden thrown upon her must have been
						great. With the terrible remembrance of the scenes of 1692, it was greater
						than she could bear. Her health began to decline, and she was long an
						invalid. Under the tender and faithful guidance of Mr. Green, she did all
						that she could to seek the forgiveness of God and man. After consultations
						with him, in visits to his study, a confession was drawn up, which she
						desired publicly to make. Upon conferring with Samuel Nurse, it was found to
						be satisfactory to him, as the representative of those who had suffered from
						her testimony. It was her desire to offer this <pb n="510" id="vII510"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2523">
							<figDesc>Page 510.</figDesc>
						</figure> confession and a profession of religion at the same time. The day
						was fixed, and made known to the public. On the 25th of August, 1706, a
						great concourse assembled in the meeting-house. Large numbers came from
						other places, particularly from the town of Salem. The following document,
						having been judged sufficient and suitable, was written out in the
						church-book the evening before, and signed by her. It was read by the pastor
						before the congregation, who were seated; she standing in her place while it
						was read, and owning it as hers by a declaration to that effect at its
						close, and also acknowledging the signature.</p>

						compunctions of conscience. The load of sin was easily thrown upon the back
						of Satan. This young woman was undoubtedly sincere in her penitence, and was
						forgiven, we trust and believe; but she failed to see the depth of her
						iniquity, and of those who instigated and aided her, in her false
						accusations. The blame, and the deed, were wholly hers and theirs. Satan had
						no share in it. Human responsibility cannot thus be avoided.</p>
					<p>While, in a certain sense, she imputes the blame to Satan, this declaration
						of Ann Putnam is conclusive evidence that she and her confederate accusers
						did not believe in any communications having been made to them by invisible
						spirits of any kind. Those persons, in our day, who imagine that they hold
						intercourse, by rapping or otherwise, with spiritual beings, have sometimes
						found arguments in favor of their belief in the phenomena of the witchcraft
						trials. But Ann Putnam's confession is decisive against this. If she had
						really received from invisible beings, subordinate spirits, or the spirits
						of deceased persons, the matters to which she testified, or ever believed
						that she had, she would have said so. On the contrary, she declares that she
						had no foundation whatever, from any source, for what she said, but was
						under the subtle and mysterious influence of the Devil himself.</p>
					<p>She died at about the age of thirty-six years. Her will is dated May 20,
						1715, and was presented in probate June 29, 1716. Its preamble is as
						follows: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“In the name of God, amen. I, Anne Putnam, of the town of Salem, single
							woman, being oftentimes sick and weak in body, but of a disposing mind
							and memory, blessed be God! and calling to mind the mortality of my
							body, and that it is appointed for all men once to die, do make this my
							last will and testament. First of all, I recommend my spirit into the
							hands of God, through Jesus Christ my Redeemer, with whom I hope to live
							for ever; and, as for my body, I commit it to the earth, to be buried in
							a Christian and decent manner, at the discretion of my executor,
							hereafter named, nothing doubting but, by the mighty power of God, to
							receive the same again at the resurrection.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>She divided her land to her four brothers, and her personal estate to her
						four sisters.</p>
					<p>It seems that she was frequently the subject of sickness, and <pb n="512"
							id="vII512"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2525">
							<figDesc>Page 512.</figDesc>
						</figure> her bodily powers much weakened. The probability is, that the
						long-continued strain kept upon her muscular and nervous organization,
						during the witchcraft scenes, had destroyed her constitution. Such
						uninterrupted and vehement exercise, to their utmost tension, of the
						imaginative, intellectual, and physical powers, in crowded and heated rooms,
						before the public gaze, and under the feverish and consuming influence of
						bewildering and all but delirious excitement, could hardly fail to sap the
						foundations of health in so young a child. The tradition is, that she had a
						slow and fluctuating decline. The language of her will intimates, that, at
						intervals, there were apparent checks to her discase, and rallies of
						strength, — “oftentimes sick and weak in body.” She inherited from her
						mother a sensitive and fragile constitution; but her father, although
						brought to the grave, probably by the terrible responsibilities and trials
						in which he had been involved, at a comparatively early age, belonged to a
						long-lived race and neighborhood. The opposite elements of her composition
						struggled in a protracted contest, — on the one side, a nature morbidly
						subject to nervous excitability sinking under the exhaustion of an
						overworked, overburdened, and shattered system; on the other, tenacity of
						life. The conflict continued with alternating success for years; but the
						latter gave way at last. Her story, in all its aspects, is worthy of the
						study of the psychologist. Her confession, profession, and death point the
						moral.</p>
					<p>The Rev. Joseph Green died Nov. 26, 1715. The following tribute to his memory
						is inscribed on the records of the church. It is in the handwriting, and
						style of thought and language, of Deacon Edward Putnam.</p>

						<p>“Sept. 5, 1746. — At a church meeting appointed on the lecture, the day
							before, on the occasion of several persons in this parish being reported
							to have resorted to a woman of a very ill reputation, pretending to the
							art of divination and fortune-telling, &amp;c., to make inquiry into
							that matter, and to take such resolutions as may be thought proper on
							the occasion, the brethren of the church then present came into the
							following votes; viz., That for Christians, especially church-members,
							to seek to and consult reputed witches or fortune-tellers, this church
							is clearly of opinion, and firmly believes on the testimony of the Word
							of God, is highly impious and scandalous, being a violation of the
							Christian covenant sealed in baptism, rendering the persons guilty of it
							subject to the just censure of the church.</p>
						<p>“No proof appearing against any of the members of this church (some of
							whom had been strongly suspected of this crime), so as to convict them
							of their being guilty, it was further voted, That the pastor, in the
							name of the church, should publicly testify their disapprobation and
							abhorrence of this infamous and ungodly practice of consulting witches
							or fortune-tellers, or any that are reputed such; exhorting all under
							their watch, who may have been guilty of it, to an hearty repentance and
							returning to God, earnestly seeking forgiveness in the blood of Christ,
							and warning all against the like practice for the time to come.</p>
						<p>“Sept. 7. — This testimony, exhortation, and warning, voted by the
							church, was publicly given by the pastor, before the dismission of the
							congregation.”</p>
					</q>
					<p>The Salem Village Parish, when its present pastor, the Rev. Charles B. Rice,
						was settled, Sept. 2, 1863, had been in existence a hundred and ninety-one
						years. During its first twenty-five years, it had four ministers, whose
						aggregate period of service was eighteen years. During the succeeding
						hundred and sixty years, it had four ministers, whose aggregate period of
						service <pb n="514" id="vII514"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2527">
							<figDesc>Page 514.</figDesc>
						</figure> was one hundred and fifty-eight years. They had all been well
						educated, several were men of uncommon endowments, and without exception
						they possessed qualities suitable for success and usefulness in their
						calling.</p>
					<p>The first period was filled with an uninterrupted series of troubles,
						quarrels, and animosities, culminating in the most terrific and horrible
						disaster that ever fell upon a people. The second period was an
						uninterrupted reign of peace, harmony, and unity; no religious society ever
						enjoying more comfort in its privileges, or exhibiting a better example of
						all that ought to characterize a Christian congregation.</p>
					<p>The contrast between the lives of its ministers, in the two periods
						respectively, is as great as between their pastorates. The first four
						suffered from inadequate means of support, and, owing to the feuds in the
						congregation, rates not being collected, were hardly supplied with the
						necessaries of life. There is no symptom in the records of the second period
						of there having ever been any difficulty on this score. The prompt
						fulfilment of their contracts by the people, and the favor of Providence,
						placed the ministers above the reach or approach of inconvenience or
						annoyance from that quarter.</p>
					<p>The history of the New-England churches presents no epoch more melancholy,
						distressful, and stormy than the first, and none more united, prosperous, or
						commendable than the second period in the annals of the Salem Village
						church.</p>
					<p>The contrast between the fortunes and fates of the ministers of these two
						periods is worthy of being stated in detail.</p>
					<p>James Bayley began to preach at the Village at the formation of the society,
						when he was quite a young man, within three years from receiving his degree
						at Harvard College. After about seven years, during which he buried his wife
						and three children, and encountered a bitter and turbulent opposition, — so
						far as we can see, most causeless and unreasonable, — he relinquished the
						ministry altogether, and spent the residue of his life in another profession
						elsewhere.</p>
					<p>The ministry of George Burroughs, at the Village, lasted about two years. The
						violence of both parties to the controversy by which the parish had been
						rent was concentrated upon his innocent and unsheltered head. He was, at a
						public assembly of his <pb n="515" id="vII515"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2528">
							<figDesc>Page 515.</figDesc>
						</figure> people, in his own meeting-house, arrested, and taken out in the
						custody of the marshal of the county, a prisoner for a debt incurred to meet
						the expenses of his wife's recent funeral, of an amount less than the salary
						then due him, and which, in point of fact, he had paid at the time by an
						order upon the parish treasurer. From such outrageous ill-treatment, he
						escaped by resigning his ministry. He was followed to his retreat in a
						remote settlement, and while engaged there, a laborious, self-sacrificing,
						and devoted minister, was<unclear/> by the malignity of his enemies at the
						Village, suddenly seized, all unconscious of having wronged a human
						creature, snatched from the table where he was taking his frugal meal in his
						humble home, torn from his helpless family, hurried up to the Village;
						overwhelmed in a storm of falsehood, rage, and folly; loaded with irons,
						immured in a dungeon, carried to the place of execution, consigned to the
						death of a felon; and his uncoffined remains thrown among the clefts of the
						rocks of Witch Hill, and left but half buried, — for a crime of which he was
						as innocent as the unborn child.</p>
					<p>Deodat Lawson, a great scholar and great preacher, after a two years' trial,
						and having buried his wife and daughter at the Village, abandoned the
						attempt to quell the storm of passion there. He found another settlement on
						the other side of Massachusetts Bay, which he left without taking leave, and
						was never heard of more by his people. Eight years afterwards, he
						re-appeared in the reprint, at London, of his famous Salem Village sermon,
						and then vanished for ever from sight. A cloud of impenetrable darkness
						envelopes his name at that point. Of his fate nothing is known, except that
						it was an “unhappy” one.</p>
					<p>Samuel Parris, after a ministry of seven years, crowded from the very
						beginning with contention and animosity, and closed in desolation, ruin, and
						woes unutterable, havoc scattered among his people and the whole country
						round, was driven from the parish, the blood of the innocent charged upon
						his head, and, for the rest of his days, consigned to obscurity and penury.
						The place of his abode has upon it no habitation or structure of man; and
						the only vestiges left of him are his records of the long quarrel with his
						congregation, and his inscription on the headstone, erected by him, as he
						left the Village for ever, over the fresh grave of his wife.</p>
					<pb n="516" id="vII516"/>
					<p>
						<figure id="Uphv2529">
							<figDesc>Page 516.</figDesc>
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>Surely, the annals of no church present a more dismal, shocking, or shameful
						history than this.</p>
					<p>Joseph Green, on the 26th of November, 1715, terminated with his life a
						ministry of eighteen years, as useful, beneficent, and honorable as it had
						been throughout harmonious and happy. Peter Clark died in office, June 10,
						1768, after a service of fifty-one years. He was recognized throughout the
						country as an able minister and a learned divine. Peace and prosperity
						reigned, without a moment's intermission, among the people of his charge.
						Benjamin Wadsworth, D.D., also died in office, Jan. 18, 1826, after a
						service of fifty-four years. Through life he was universally esteemed and
						loved in all the churches. Milton P. Braman, D.D., on the 1st of April,
						1861, terminated by resignation a ministry of thirty-five years. He always
						enjoyed universal respect and affection, and the parish under his care,
						uninterrupted union and prosperity. He did not leave his people, but remains
						among them, participating in the enjoyment of their privileges, and
						upholding the hands of his successor. His eminent talents are occasionally
						exercised in neighboring pulpits, and in other services of public
						usefulness. He lives in honored retirement on land originally belonging to
						Nathaniel Putnam, distant only a few rods, a little to the north of east,
						from the spot owned and occupied by his first predecessor, James Bayley.</p>
					<p>It can be said with assurance, of this epoch in the history of the Salem
						Village church and society, that it can hardly be paralleled in all that
						indicates the well-being of man or the blessings of Heaven. No such
						contrast, as these two periods in the annals of this parish present, can
						elsewhere be found.</p>
					<p>Prosecutions for witchcraft continued in the older countries after they had
						been abandoned here; although it soon began to be difficult, everywhere, to
						procure the conviction of a person accused of witchcraft. In 1716, a Mrs.
						Hicks and her daughter, the latter aged nine years, were hanged in
						Huntingdon, in England, for witchcraft. In the year 1720, an attempt,
						already alluded to, was made to renew the Salem excitement in Littleton,
						Mass., but it failed: the people had learned wisdom at a price too dear to
						allow them so soon to forget it. In a letter to Cotton Mather, written Feb.
						19, 1720, the excellent Dr. Watts, after having expressed his doubts
						respecting the sufficiency of the spectral <pb n="517" id="vII517"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2530">

						</figure> evidence for condemnation, says, in reference to the Salem
						witchcraft, “I am much persuaded that there was much immediate agency of the
						Devil in these affairs, and perhaps there were some real witches too.” Not
						far from this time, we find what was probably the opinion of the most
						liberal-minded and cultivated people in England expressed in the following
						language of Addison: “To speak my thoughts freely, I believe, in general,
						that there is and has been such a thing as witchcraft, but, at the same
						time, can give no credit to any particular instance of it.”</p>
					<p>There was an execution for witchcraft in Scotland in 1722. As late as the
						middle of the last century, an annual discourse, commemorative of executions
						that took place in Huntingdon during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, continued
						to be delivered in that place. An act of a Presbyterian synod in Scotland,
						published in 1743, and reprinted at Glasgow in 1766, denounced as a national
						sin the repeal of the penal laws against witchcraft.</p>
					<p>Blackstone, the great oracle of British law, and who flourished in the latter
						half of the last century, declared his belief in witchcraft in the following
						strong terms: “To deny the possibility, nay, the actual existence, of
						witchcraft and sorcery, is at once flatly to contradict the revealed Word of
						God, in various passages both of the Old and New Testament; and the thing
						itself is a truth to which every nation in the world hath in its turn borne
						testimony, either by examples seemingly well attested, or by prohibitory
						laws, which at least suppose the possibility of commerce with evil
						spirits.”</p>
					<p>It is related, in White's “Natural History of Selborne,” that, in the year
						1751, the people of Tring, a market town of Hertfordshire, and scarcely more
						than thirty miles from London, “seized on two superannuated wretches, crazed
						with age and overwhelmed with infirmities, on a suspicion of witchcraft.”
						They were carried to the edge of a horse-pond, and there subjected to the
						water ordeal. The trial resulted in the acquittal of the prisoners; but they
						were both drowned in the process.</p>
					<p>A systematic effort seems to have been made during the eighteenth century to
						strengthen and renew the power of superstition. Alarmed by the progress of
						infidelity, many eminent and excellent men availed themselves of the
						facilities which their position at the head of the prevailing literature
						afforded them, to push the <pb n="518" id="vII518"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2531">
							<figDesc>Page 518.</figDesc>
						</figure> faith of the people as far as possible towards the opposite
						extreme of credulity. It was a most unwise, and, in its effects, deplorable
						policy. It was a betrayal of the cause of true religion. It was an
						acknowledgment that it could not be vindicated before the tribunal of severe
						reason. Besides all the misery produced by filling the imagination with
						unreal objects of terror, the restoration to influence, during the last
						century, of the fables and delusions of an ignorant age, has done
						incalculable injury, by preventing the progress of Christian truth and sound
						philosophy; thus promoting the cause of the very infidelity it was intended
						to check. The idea of putting down one error by setting up another cannot
						have suggested itself to any mind that had ever been led to appreciate the
						value or the force of truth. But this was the policy of Christian writers
						from the time of Addison to that of Johnson. The latter expressly confesses,
						that it was necessary to maintain the credit of the belief of the existence
						and agency of ghosts, and other supernatural beings, in order to help on the
						argument for a future state as founded upon the Bible.</p>
					<p>Dr. Hibbert, in his excellent book on the “Philosophy of Apparitions,”
						illustrates some remarks similar to those just made, by the following
						quotation from Mr. Wesley: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“It is true, that the English in general, and indeed most of the men in
							Europe, have given up all accounts of witches and apparitions as mere
							old wives' fables. I am sorry for it; and I willingly take this
							opportunity of entering my solemn protest against this violent
							compliment, which so many that believe the Bible pay to those who do not
							believe it. I owe them no such service. I take knowledge, these are at
							the bottom of the outcry which has been raised, and with such insolence
							spread throughout the nation, in direct opposition, not only to the
							Bible, but to the suffrage of the wisest and best men in all ages and
							nations. They well know (whether Christians know it or not), that the
							giving up witchcraft is, in effect, giving up the Bible. And they know,
							on the other hand, that, if but one account of the intercourse of men
							with separate spirits be admitted, their whole castle in the air (Deism,
							Atheism, Materialism) falls to the ground. I know no reason, therefore,
							why we should suffer even this weapon to be wrested out of our hands.
							Indeed, there are numerous arguments besides, which abundantly confute
							their vain imaginations. But we need not be hooted out of one: neither
							reason nor religion requires this.”</p>

					<p>The belief in witchcraft continued to hold a conspicuous place among popular
						superstitions during the whole of the last century. Many now living can
						remember the time when it prevailed very generally. Each town or village had
						its peculiar traditionary tales, which were gravely related by the old, and
						deeply impressed upon the young.</p>
					<p>The legend of the “Screeching Woman” of Marblehead is worthy of being
						generally known. The story runs thus: A piratical cruiser, having captured a
						Spanish vessel during the seventeenth century, brought her into Marblehead
						harbor, which was then the site of a few humble dwellings. The male
						inhabitants were all absent on their fishing voyages. The pirates brought
						their prisoners ashore, carried them at the dead of the night into a retired
						glen, and there murdered them. Among the captives was an English female
						passenger. The women who belonged to the place heard her dying outcries, as
						they rose through the midnight air, and erverberated far and wide along the
						silent shores. She was heard to exclaim, “O mercy, mercy! Lord Jesus Christ,
						save me! Lord Jesus Christ, save me!” Her body was buried by the pirates on
						the spot. The same piercing voice is believed to be heard at intervals, more
						or less often, almost every year, in the stillness of a calm starlight or
						clear moonlight night. There is something, it is said, so wild, mysterious,
						and evidently superhuman in the sound, as to strike a chill of dread into
						the hearts of all who listen to it. The writer of an article on this
						subject, in the “Marblehead Register” of April 3, 1830, declares, that
						“there are not wanting, at the present day, persons of unimpeachable
						veracity and known respectability, who still continue firmly to believe the
						tradition, and to assert that they themselves have been auditors of the
						sounds described, which they declare were of such an unearthly nature as to
						preclude the idea of imposition or deception.”</p>
					<p>When “the silver moon unclouded holds her way,” or when the stars are
						glistening in the clear, cold sky, and the dark forms of the moored vessels
						are at rest upon the sleeping bosom of the harbor; when no natural sound
						comes forth from the animate or inanimate creation but the dull and
						melancholy rote of the sea along the rocky and winding coast, — how often is
						the watcher startled from the reveries of an excited imagination by the
						piteous, <pb n="520" id="vII520"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2533">
							<figDesc>Page 520.</figDesc>
						</figure> dismal, and terrific screams of the unlaid ghost of the murdered
						lady!</p>
					<p>A negro died, fifty years ago, in that part of Danvers called originally
						Salem Village, at a very advanced age. He was supposed to have reached his
						hundredth year. He never could be prevailed upon to admit that there was any
						delusion or mistake in the proceedings of 1692. To him, the whole affair was
						easy of explanation. He believed that the witchcraft was occasioned by the
						circumstance of the Devil's having purloined the church-book, and that it
						subsided so soon as the book was recovered from his grasp. Perhaps the
						particular hypothesis of the venerable African was peculiar to himself; but
						those persons must have a slight acquaintance with the history of opinions
						in this and every other country, who are not aware that the superstition on
						which it was founded has been extensively entertained by men of every color,
						almost, if not quite, up to the present day. If the doctrines of demonology
						have been completely overthrown and exterminated in our villages and cities,
						it is a very recent achievement; nay, I fear that in many places the
						auspicious event remains to take place.</p>
					<p>In the year 1808, the inhabitants of Great Paxton, a village of
						Huntingdonshire, in England, within sixty miles of London, rose in a body,
						attacked the house of an humble, and, so far as appears, inoffensive and
						estimable woman, named Ann Izard, suspected of bewitching three young
						females, — Alice Brown, Fanny Amey, and Mary Fox, — dragged her out of her
						bed into the fields, pierced her arms and body with pins, and tore her flesh
						with their nails, until she was covered with blood. They committed the same
						barbarous outrage upon her again, a short time afterwards; and would have
						subjected her to the water ordeal, had she not found means to fly from that
						part of the country.</p>
					<p>The writer of the article “Witchcraft,” in Rees's “Cyclopædia,” gravely
						maintains the doctrine of “ocular fascination.”</p>
					<p>Prosecutions for witchcraft are stated to have occurred, in the first half of
						the present century, in some of the interior districts of our Southern
						States. The civilized world is even yet full of necromancers and
						thaumaturgists of every kind. The science of “palmistry” is still practised
						by many a muttering vagrant; and perhaps some in this neighborhood remember
						when, in the days <pb n="521" id="vII521"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2534">
							<figDesc>Page 521.</figDesc>
						</figure> of their youthful fancy, they held out their hands, that their
						future fortunes might be read in the lines of their palms, and their wild
						and giddy curiosity and anxious affections be gratified by information
						respecting wedding-day or absent lover.</p>
					<p>The most celebrated fortune-teller, perhaps, that ever lived, resided in an
						adjoining town. The character of “Moll Pitcher” is familiarly known in all
						parts of the commercial world. She died in 1813. Her place of abode was
						beneath the projecting and elevated summit of High Rock, in Lynn, and
						commanded a view of the wild and indented coast of Marblehead, of the
						extended and resounding beaches of Lynn and Chelsea, of Nahant Rocks, of the
						vessels and islands of Boston's beautiful bay, and of its remote southern
						shore. She derived her mysterious gifts by inheritance, her grandfather
						having practised them before in Marblehead. Sailors, merchants, and
						adventurers of every kind, visited her residence, and placed confidence in
						her predictions. People came from great distances to learn the fate of
						missing friends, or recover the possession of lost goods; while the young of
						both sexes, impatient of the tardy pace of time, and burning with curiosity
						to discern the secrets of futurity, availed themselves of every opportunity
						to visit her lowly dwelling, and hear from her prophetic lips the revelation
						of the most tender incidents and important events of their coming lives. She
						read the future, and traced what to mere mortal eyes were the mysteries of
						the present or the past, in the arrangement and aspect of the grounds or
						settlings of a cup of tea or coffee. Her name has everywhere become the
						generic title of fortune-tellers, and occupies a conspicuous place in the
						legends and ballads of popular superstition. Her renown has gone abroad to
						the farthest regions, and her memory will be perpetuated in the annals of
						credulity and imposture. An air of romance is breathed around the scenes
						where she practised her mystic art, the interest and charm of which will
						increase as the lapse of time removes her history back towards the dimness
						of the distant past.</p>
					<p>The elements of the witchcraft delusion of 1692 are slumbering still in the
						bosom of society. We hear occasionally of haunted houses, cases of
						second-sight, and communications from the spiritual world. It always will be
						so. The human mind feels instinctively its connection with a higher sphere.
						Some will ever be <pb n="522" id="vII522"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2535">
							<figDesc>Page 522.</figDesc>
						</figure> impatient of the restraints of our present mode of being, and
						prone to break away from them; eager to pry into the secrets of the
						invisible world, willing to venture beyond the bounds of ascertainable
						knowledge, and, in the pursuit of truth, to aspire where the laws of
						evidence cannot follow them. A love of the marvellous is inherent to the
						sense of limitation while in these terrestrial bodies; and many will always
						be found not content to wait until this tabernacle is dissolved and we shall
						be clothed upon with a body which is from Heaven.</p>

						<p>* The facts and considerations in reference to the authorship of the
							letter to Jonathan Corwin may be summarily stated as follows: —</p>
						<p>The letter is signed “R. P.” Under these initials is written, “Robert
							Pain,” in a different hand, and, as the ink as well as the chirography
							shows, at a somewhat later date. R. P. are blotted over, but with ink of
							such lighter hue that the original letters are clearly discernible under
							it. A Robert Paine graduated at Harvard College, in 1656. But he was
							probably the foreman of the grand jury that brought in all the
							indictments in the witchcraft trials; and therefore could not, from the
							declarations in the letter itself, have been its author. The only other
							person of that name at the time, of whom we have knowledge, was his
							father, who seems, by the evidence we have, to have died in 1693. (That
							date is given in the Harvard Triennial for the death of Robert Paine,
							the graduate; but erroneously, I think, as signatures to documents, and
							conveyances of property subsequently, can hardly be ascribed to any
							other person.) Robert Paine, the father, from the earliest settlement of
							Ipswich, had been one of the leading men of the town, apparently of
							larger property than any other, often its deputy in the General Court,
							and, for a great length of time, ruling elder of the church. “Elder
							Pain,” or Penn, as the name was often spelled, enjoyed the friendship of
							John Norton, and all the ministers far and near; and religious meetings
							were often held at his house. We know nothing to justify us in saying
							that he could not have been the author of this paper; but we also know
							nothing, except the appearance of his name upon it, to impute it to
							him.</p>
						<p>The document is dated from “Salisbury.” So far as we know, Elder Paine
							always lived in Ipswich; although, having property in the upper county,
							he may have often been, and possibly in his last years resided, there.
							It is, it is true, a strong circumstance, that his name is written,
							although by a late hand, under the initials. It shows that the person
							who wrote it thought that “R. P.” meant Robert Paine; but any one
							conversant especially with the antiquities of Ipswich, or this part of
							the county, might naturally fall into such a mistake. The authorship of
							documents was often erroneously ascribed. The words “Robert Pain” were,
							probably, not on the paper when the indorsement was made, “A letter to
							my grandfather,” &amp;c. Elder Robert Paine, if living in 1692, was
							ninety-one years of age. The document under consideration, if composed
							by him, is truly a marvellous production, — an intellectual phenomenon
							not easily to be paralleled.</p>
						<p>The facts in reference to Robert Pike, of Salisbury, as they bear upon
							the question of the authorship of the document, are these. He was
							seventy-six years of age in 1692, and had always resided in “Salisbury.”
							The letter and argument are both in the handwriting of Captain Thomas
							Bradbury, Recorder of old Norfolk County. On this point, there can be no
							question. Bradbury and Pike had been fellow-townsmen for more than half
							a century, connected by all the ties of neighborhood and family
							intermarriage, and jointly or alternately had borne all the civic and
							military honors the people could bestow. The document was prepared and
							delivered to the judge while Mrs. Bradbury was in prison, and just one
							month before her trial. Pike, as has been shown (p. 226), was deeply
							interested in her behalf. The original signature (“R. P.”) has the
							marked characteristics of the same initial letters as found in
							innumerable autographs of his, on file or record. There are
							interlineations, beyond question in Pike's handwriting. These facts
							demonstrate that both Pike and Bradbury were concerned in producing the
							document.</p>
						<p>The history of Robert Pike proves that he was a man of great ability, had
							a turn of mind towards logical exercises, and was, from early life,
							conversant with disputations. Nearly fifty years before, he argued in
							town-meeting against the propriety, in view of civil and ecclesiastical
							law, of certain acts of the General Court. They arraigned,
							disfranchised, and otherwise punished him for his “litigiousness:” but
							the weight of his character soon compelled them to restore his political
							rights; and the people of Salisbury, the very next year, sent him among
							them as their deputy, and continued him from time to time in that
							capacity. At a subsequent period, he was the leader and spokesman of a
							party in a controversy about some ecclesiastical affairs, involving
							apparently certain nice questions of theology, which created a great
							stir through the country. The contest reached so high a point, that the
							church at Salisbury excommunicated him; but the public voice demanded a
							council of churches, which assembled in September, 1676, and re-instated
							Major Pike condemning his excommunication, “finding it not justifiable
							upon divers grounds.” On this occasion, as before, the General Court
							frowned upon and denounced him; but the people came again to his rescue,
							sending him at the next election into the House of Deputies, and kept
							him there until raised to the Upper House as an Assistant. He was in the
							practice of conducting causes in the courts, and was long a local
							magistrate and one of the county judges.</p>
						<p>He does not appear to have been present at any of the trials or
							examinations of 1692; but his official position as Assistant caused many
							depositions taken in his neighborhood to be acknowledged and sworn
							before him. While entertaining the prevalent views about diabolical
							agency, he always disapproved of the proceedings of the Court in the
							particulars to which the arguments of the communication to Jonathan
							Corwin apply, — the “spectre evidence,” — and the statements and actings
							of “the afflicted children.” There are indications that sometimes he saw
							through the folly of the stories told by persons whose depositions he
							was called to attest. One John Pressy was circulating a wonderful tale
							about an encounter he had with the spectre of Susanna Martin. Pike sent
							for him, and took his deposition. Pressy averred, that, one evening,
							coming from Amesbury Ferry, he fell in with the shape of Martin in the
							form of a body of light, which “seemed to be about the bigness of a
							half-bushel.” After much dodging and manœuvring, and being lost and
							bewildered, wandering to and fro, tumbling into holes, — where, as the
							deposition states, no “such pitts” were known to exist, — and other
							misadventures, he came to blows with the light, and had several brushes
							with it, striking it with his stick. At one time, “he thinks he gave her
							at least forty blows.” He finally succeeded in finding “his own house:
							but, being then seized with fear, could not speak till his wife spoke to
							him at the door, and was in such a condition that the family was afraid
							of him; which story being carried to the town the next day, it was, upon
							inquiry, understood, that said Goodwife Martin was in such a miserable
							case and in such pain that they swabbed her body, as was reported.” He
							concludes his deposition by saying, that Major Pike “seemed to be
							troubled that this deponent had not told him of it in season that she
							might have been viewed to have seen what her all was.” The affair had
							happened “about twenty-four years ago.” Probably neither Pressy nor the
							Court appreciated the keenness of the major's expression of regret. It
							broke the bubble of the deposition. The whole story was the product of a
							benighted imagination, disordered by fear, filled with inebriate
							vagaries, exaggerated in nightmare, and resting upon wild and empty
							rumors. Robert Pike's course, in the case of Mrs. Bradbury, harmonizes
							with the supposition that he was Corwin's correspondent.</p>
						<p>Materials may be brought to light that will change the evidence on the
							point. It may be found that Elder Paine died before 1692: that would
							dispose of the question. It may appear that he was living in Salisbury
							at the time, and acted with Pike and Bradbury, they giving to the paper
							the authority of his venerable name and years. But all that is now
							known, constrains me to the conclusion stated in the text.</p>

						<p>* As an illustration of the oblivion that had settled over the details of
							the transactions and characters connected with the witchcraft
							prosecutions, it may be mentioned, that when, thirty-five years ago, I
							prepared the work entitled `Lectures on Witchcraft; comprising a History
							of the Delusion in 1692,' although professional engagements prevented my
							making the elaborate exploration that has now been given to the subject,
							I extended the investigation over the ordinary fields of research, and
							took particular pains to obtain information brought down by tradition,
							gleaned all that could be gathered from the memories of old persons then
							living of what they had heard from their predecessors, and sought for
							every thing that local antiquaries and genealogists could contribute. I
							find, by the methods of inquiry adopted in the preparation of the
							present work, how inadequate and meagre was the knowledge then
							possessed. Most of the persons accused and executed, like Giles Corey,
							his wife Martha, and Bridget Bishop, were supposed to have been of
							humble, if not mean condition, of vagrant habits, and more or less
							despicable repute. By following the threads placed in my hands, in the
							files of the county-offices of Registry of Deeds and Wills, and
							documents connected with trials at law, and by a collation of
							conveyances and the administration of estates, I find that Corey,
							however eccentric or open to criticism in some features of character and
							passages of his life, was a large landholder, and a man of singular
							force and acuteness of intellect; while his wife had an intelligence in
							advance of her times, and was a woman of eminent piety. The same is
							found to have been the case with most of those who suffered.</p>
						<p>The reader may judge of my surprise in now discovering, that, while at
							different times. Neither are records always to be relied upon as to
							precision. In the record-book of the village church, Mr. Parris enters
							the age of Mrs. Ann Putnam, at the date of her admission, June 4, 1691,
							as “Ann: ætat: 27.” But an “Account of the Early Settlers of Salisbury,”
							in the “New-England Historical and Genealogical Register,” vol. vii. p.
							314, gives the date of her birth “15, 4, 1661.” Her age is stated above
							according to this last authority; and, if correct, she was not so young,
							at the time of her marriage, as intimated (vol. i. p. 253), but
							seventeen years five months and ten days. It is difficult, however, to
							conceive how Parris, who was careful about such matters, and undoubtedly
							had his information from her own lips, could have been so far out of the
							way. Her brother, William Carr, in 1692, deposed that he was then
							forty-one years of age or thereabouts; whereas, the “Account of the
							Early Settlers of Salisbury,” just referred to, gives the date of his
							birth “15, 1, 1648.” It is indeed singular, that two members of a family
							of their standing should have been under an error as to their own age;
							one to an extent of almost, the other of some months more than, three
							years.</p>
					</note>
					<note id="v2n11" place="unspecified" anchored="yes"><p>* The following passage
							is from the parish records: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“On the 3d of February, 1693, a warrant was issued for a meeting of
								the inhabitants of the village, signed by Thomas Preston, Joseph
								Pope, Joseph Houlton, and John Tarbell, of the standing annual
								committee, to be held Feb. 14, “to consider and agree and determine
								who are capable of voting in our public transactions, by the power
								given us by the General-court order at our first settlement; and to
								consider of and make void a vote in our book of records, on the 18th
								of June, 1689, where there is a salary of sixty-six pounds stated to
								Mr. Parris, he not complying with it; also to consider of and make
								void several votes in the book of records on the 10th of October,
								1692, where our ministry house and barn and two acres of land seem
								to be conveyed from us after a fraudulent manner.”</p>
						</q>
						<p>At this meeting, it was voted, that “all men that are ratable, or
							hereafter shall be living within that tract of land mentioned in our
							General-court order, shall have liberty in nominating and appointing a
							committee, and voting in any of our public concerns.”</p>
						<p>By referring to the account, in the First Part, of the controversy
							between the inhabitants of the village and Mr. Bayley, “the power” above
							alluded to, “given us by the General Court,” will be seen fully
							described. In its earnestness to fasten Mr. Bayley upon “the
							inhabitants,” the Court elaborately ordained the system by which they
							should be constrained to provide for him, and compelled to raise the
							means of paying his salary. As no church had then been organized, the
							General Court fastened the duty upon “householders.” The fact had not
							been forgotten, and the above vote showed that the parish intended to
							hold on to the power then given them. This highly incensed the Court of
							Sessions. It ordered the parish book of records to be produced before
							it, and caused a condemnation of such a claim of right to be written
							out, in open Court, on the face of the record, where it is now to be
							seen. It is as follows: —</p>
						<q direct="unspecified">
							<p>“At the General Sessions of the Peace holden at Ipswich, March the
								28th, 1693. This Court having viewed and considered the above
								agreement or vote contained in the last five lines, finding the same
								to be repugnant to the laws of this province, do declare the same to
								be null and void, and that this order be recorded with the records
								of this Court.</p>

							into the kingdom of God. Now, since (besides your share in the common
							calamities, under the burden whereof this poor people are groaning at
							this time) the righteous and holy God hath been pleased to permit a sore
							and grievous affliction to befall you, such as can hardly be said to be
							common to men; viz., by giving liberty to Satan to range and rage
							amongst you, to the torturing the bodies and distracting the minds of
							some of the visible sheep and lambs of the Lord Jesus Christ. And (which
							is yet more astonishing) he who is the accuser of the brethren endeavors
							to introduce as criminal some of the visible subjects of Christ's
							kingdom, by whose sober and godly conversation in times <pb n="526"

							of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would cause all grace to abound to you
							and in you, that your poor place may be delivered from those breaking
							and ruining calamities which are threatened as the pernicious
							consequences of Satan's malicious operations; and that you may not be
							left to bite and devour one another in your sacred or civil society, in
							your relations or families, to the destroying much good and promoting
							much evil among you, so as in any kind to weaken the hands or discourage
							the heart of your reverend and pious pastor, whose family also being so
							much under the influence of these troubles, spiritual sympathy cannot
							but stir you up to assist him as at all times, so especially at such a
							time as this; he, as well as his neighbors, being under such awful
							circumstances. As to this discourse, my humble desire and endeavor is,
							that it may appear to be according to the form of sound words, and in

							afterwards to give way to the printing of it. I present it therefore to
							your acceptance, and commend it to the divine benediction; and that it
							may please the Almighty God to manifest his power in putting an end to
							your sorrows of this nature, by bruising Satan under your feet shortly,

					<p rend="center">[Appended to his Sermon, London edition, 1704.]</p>
					<p><hi rend="smallcaps">At</hi> the request of several worthy ministers and
						Christian friends, I do here annex, by way of appendix to the preceding
						sermon, some brief account of those amazing things which occasioned that
						discourse to be delivered. Let the reader please therefore to take it in the
						brief remarks following, and judge as God shall incline him.</p>
					<p>It pleased God, in the year of our Lord 1692, to visit the people at a place
						called Salem Village, in New England, with a very sore and grievous
						affliction, in which they had reason to believe that the sovereign and holy
						God was pleased to permit Satan and his instruments to affright and afflict
						those poor mortals in such an astonishing and unusual manner.</p>
					<p>Now, I having for some time before attended the work of the ministry in that
						village, the report of those great afflictions came quickly to my notice,
						and the more readily because the first person afflicted was in the
						minister's family who succeeded me after I was removed from them. In pity,
						therefore, to my Christian friends and former acquaintance there, I was much
						concerned about them, frequently consulted with them, and fervently, by
						divine assistance, prayed for them; but especially my concern was augmented
						when it was reported, at an examination of a person suspected for
						witchcraft, that my wife and daughter, who died three years before, were
						sent out of the world under the malicious operations of the infernal powers,
						as is more fully represented in the following remarks. I did then desire,
						and was also desired by some concerned in the Court, to be there present,
						that I might hear what was alleged in that respect; observing, therefore,
						when I was amongst them, that the case of the afflicted was very amazing and
						deplorable, and the charges brought against the accused such as were ground
						of suspicions, yet very intricate, and difficult to draw up right
						conclusions about them; I thought good, for the satisfaction of myself and
						such of my friends as might be curious to inquire into those mysteries of
						God's providence and Satan's malice, to draw up and keep by me a brief
						account of the most remarkable things that came to my knowledge in those
						affairs, which remarks were afterwards (at my request) revised and corrected
						by some who sat judges on the bench in those matters, and were now
						transcribed from the same paper on which they were then written. After this,
						I being by the providence of God <pb n="528" id="vII528"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2541">
							<figDesc>Page 528.</figDesc>
						</figure> called over into England in the year 1696, I then brought that
						paper of remarks on the witchcraft with me; upon the sight thereof some
						worthy ministers and Christian friends here desired me to reprint the
						sermon, and subjoin the remarks thereunto in way of appendix; but for some
						particular reasons I did then decline it. But now, forasmuch as I myself had
						been an eye and ear witness of most of those amazing things, so far as they
						came within the notice of human senses, and the requests of my friends were
						renewed since I came to dwell in London, I have given way to the publishing
						of them, that I may satisfy such as are not resolved to the contrary, that
						there may be (and are) such operations of the powers of darkness on the
						bodies and minds of mankind by divine permission and that those who sat
						judges on those cases may, by the serious consideration of the formidable
						aspect and perplexed circumstances of that afflictive providence, be in some
						measure excused, or at least be less censured, for passing sentence on
						several persons as being the instruments of Satan in those diabolical
						operations, when they were involved in such a dark and dismal scene of
						providence, in which Satan did seem to spin a finer thread of spiritual
						wickedness than in the ordinary methods of witchcraft: hence the judges,
						desiring to bear due testimony against such diabolical practices, were
						inclined to admit the validity of such a sort of evidence as was not so
						clearly and directly demonstrable to human senses as in other cases is
						required, or else they could not discover the mysteries of witchcraft. I
						presume not to impose upon my Christian or learned reader any opinion of
						mine how far Satan was an instrument in God's hand in these amazing
						afflictions which were on many persons there about that time; but I am
						certainly convinced, that the great God was pleased to lengthen his chain to
						a very great degree for the hurting of some and reproaching of others, as
						far as he was permitted so to do. Now, that I may not grieve any whose
						relations were either accused or afflicted in those times of trouble and
						distress, I choose to lay down every particular at large, without mentioning
						any names or persons concerned (they being wholly unknown here); resolving
						to confine myself to such a proportion of paper as is assigned to these
						remarks in this impression of the book, yet, that I may be distinct, shall
						speak briefly to the matter under three heads; viz.: —</p>
					<p>1. Relating to the afflicted.</p>
					<p>2. Relating to the accused. And,</p>
					<p>3. Relating to the confessing witches.</p>
					<p>To begin with the afflicted. —</p>
					<p>1. One or two of the first that were afflicted complaining of unusual
						illness, their relations used physic for their cure; but it was altogether
						in vain.</p>
					<p>2. They were oftentimes very stupid in their fits, and could neither hear nor
						understand, in the apprehension of the standers-by; so that, when prayer
						hath been made with some of them in such a manner as might be audible in a
						great congregation, yet, when their fit was off, they declared they did not
						hear so much as one word thereof.</p>
					<pb n="529" id="vII529"/>
					<p>
						<figure id="Uphv2542">
							<figDesc>Page 529.</figDesc>
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>3. It was several times observed, that, when they were discoursed with about
						God or Christ, or the things of salvation, they were presently afflicted at
						a dreadful rate; and hence were oftentimes outrageous, if they were
						permitted to be in the congregation in the time of the public worship.</p>
					<p>4. They sometimes told at a considerable distance, yea, several miles off,
						that such and such persons were afflicted, which hath been found to be done
						according to the time and manner they related it; and they said the spectres
						of the suspected persons told them of it.</p>
					<p>5. They affirmed that they saw the ghosts of several departed persons, who,
						at their appearing, did instigate them to discover such as (they said) were
						instruments to hasten their deaths, threatening sorely to afflict them if
						they did not make it known to the magistrates. They did affirm at the
						examination, and again at the trial of an accused person, that they saw the
						ghosts of his two wives (to whom he had carried very ill in their lives, as
						was proved by several testimonies), and also that they saw the ghosts of my
						wife and daughter (who died above three years before); and they did affirm,
						that, when the very ghosts looked on the prisoner at the bar, they looked
						red, as if the blood would fly out of their faces with indignation at him.
						The manner of it was thus: several afflicted being before the prisoner at
						the bar, on a sudden they fixed all their eyes together on a certain place
						of the floor before the prisoner, neither moving their eyes nor bodies for
						some few minutes, nor answering to any question which was asked them: so
						soon as that trance was over, some being removed out of sight and hearing,
						they were all, one after another, asked what they saw; and they did all
						agree that they saw those ghosts above mentioned. I was present, and heard
						and saw the whole of what passed upon that account, during the trial of that
						person who was accused to be the instrument of Satan's malice therein.</p>
					<p>6. In this (worse than Gallick) persecution by the dragoons of hell, the
						persons afflicted were harassed at such a dreadful rate to write their names
						in a Devil-book presented by a spectre unto them: and one, in my hearing,
						said, “I will not, I will not write! It is none of God's book, it is none of
						God's book: it is the Devil's book, for aught I know;” and, when they
						steadfastly refused to sign, they were told, if they would but touch, or
						take hold of, the book, it should do; and, lastly, the diabolical
						propositions were so low and easy, that, if they would but let their
						clothes, or any thing about them, touch the book, they should be at ease
						from their torments, it being <unclear/> consent that is aimed at by the
						Devil in those representations and operations.</p>
					<p>7. One who had been long afflicted at a stupendous rate by two or three
						spectres, when they were (to speak after the manner of men) tired out with
						tormenting of her to force or fright her to sign a covenant with the Prince
						of Darkness, they said to her, as in a diabolical and accursed passion, “Go
						your ways, and the Devil go with you; for we will be no more pestered and
						plagued about you.” And, ever after that, she was well, and no more
						afflicted, that ever I heard of.</p>
					<pb n="530" id="vII530"/>
					<p>
						<figure id="Uphv2543">
							<figDesc>Page 530.</figDesc>
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>8. Sundry pins have been taken out of the wrists and arms of the afflicted;
						and one, in time of examination of a suspected person, had a pin run through
						both her upper and her lower lip when she was called to speak, yet no
						apparent festering followed thereupon, after it was taken out.</p>
					<p>9. Some of the afflicted, as they were striving in their fits in open court,
						have (by invisible means) had their wrists bound fast together with a real
						cord, so as it could hardly be taken off without cutting. Some afflicted
						have been found with their arms tied, and hanged upon an hook, from whence
						others have been forced to take them down, that they might not expire in
						that posture.</p>
					<p>10. Some afflicted have been drawn under tables and beds by undiscerned
						force, so as they could hardly be pulled out; and one was drawn half-way
						over the side of a well, and was, with much difficulty, recovered back
						again.</p>
					<p>11. When they were most grievously afflicted, if they were brought to the
						accused, and the suspected person's hand but laid upon them, they were
						immediately relieved out of their tortures; but, if the accused did but look
						on them, they were instantly struck down again. Wherefore they used to cover
						the face of the accused, while they laid their hands on the afflicted, and
						then it obtained the desired issue: for it hath been experienced (both in
						examinations and trials), that, so soon as the afflicted came in sight of
						the accused, they were immediately cast into their fits; yea, though the
						accused were among the crowd of people unknown to the sufferers, yet, on the
						first view, were they struck down, which was observed in a child of four or
						five years of age, when it was apprehended, that so many as she could look
						upon, either directly or by turning her head, were immediately struck into
						their fits.</p>
					<p>12. An iron spindle of a woollen wheel, being taken very strangely out of an
						house at Salem Village, was used by a spectre as an instrument of torture to
						a sufferer, not being discernible to the standers-by, until it was, by the
						said sufferer, snatched out of the spectre's hand, and then it did
						immediately appear to the persons present to be really the same iron
						spindle.</p>
					<p>13. Sometimes, in their fits, they have had their tongues drawn out of their
						mouths to a fearful length, their heads turned very much over their
						shoulders; and while they have been so strained in their fits, and had their
						arms and legs, &amp;c., wrested as if they were quite dislocated, the blood
						hath gushed plentifully out of their mouths for a considerable time
						together, which some, that they might be satisfied that it was real blood,
						took upon their finger, and rubbed on their other hand. I saw several
						together thus violently strained and bleeding in their fits, to my very
						great astonishment that my fellow-mortals should be so grievously distressed
						by the invisible powers of darkness. For certainly all considerate persons
						who beheld these things must needs be convinced, that their motions in their
						fits were preternatural and involuntary, both as to the manner, which was so
						strange as a well person could not (at least without great pain) screw their
						bodies into, <pb n="531" id="vII531"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2544">
							<figDesc>Page 531.</figDesc>
						</figure> and as to the violence also, they were preternatural motions,
						being much beyond the ordinary force of the same persons when they were in
						their right minds; so that, being such grievous sufferers, it would seem
						very hard and unjust to censure them of consenting to, or holding any
						voluntary converse or familiarity with, the Devil.</p>
					<p>14. Their eyes were, for the most part, fast closed in their trance-fits, and
						when they were asked a question they could give no answer; and I do verily
						believe, they did not hear at that time; yet did they discourse with the
						spectres as with real persons, asserting things and receiving answers
						affirmative or negative, as the matter was. For instance, one, in my
						hearing, thus argued <hi rend="italics">with,</hi> and railed <hi
							rend="italics">at,</hi> a spectre: “Goodw—, begone, begone, begone! Are
						you not ashamed, a woman of your profession, to afflict a poor creature so?
						What hurt did I ever do you in my life? You have but two years to live, and
						then the Devil will torment your soul for this. Your name is blotted out of
						God's book, and it shall never be put into God's book again. Begone! For
						shame! Are you not afraid of what is coming upon you? I know, I know what
						will make you afraid, — the wrath of an angry God: I am sure that will make
						you afraid. Begone! Do not torment me. I know what you would have” (we
						judged she meant her soul): “but it is out of your reach; it is clothed with
						the white robes of Christ's righteousness.” This sufferer I was well
						acquainted with, and knew her to be a very sober and pious woman, so far as
						I could judge; and it appears that she had not, in that fit, voluntary
						converse with the Devil, for then she might have been helped to a better
						guess about that woman abovesaid, as to her living but two years, for she
						lived not many months after that time. Further, this woman, in the same fit,
						seemed to dispute with a spectre about a text of Scripture: the apparition
						seemed to deny it; she said she was sure there was such a text, and she
						would tell it; and then said she to the apparition, “I am sure you will be
						gone, for you cannot stand before that text.” Then was she sorely afflicted,
						— her mouth drawn on one side, and her body strained violently for about a
						minute; and then said, “It is, it is, it is,” three or four times, and then
						was afflicted to hinder her from telling; at last, she broke forth, and
						said, “It is the third chapter of the Revelations.” I did manifest some
						scruple about reading it, lest Satan should draw any thereby superstitiously
						to improve the word of the eternal God; yet judging I might do it once, for
						an experiment, I began to read; and, before I had read through the first
						verse, she opened her eyes, and was well. Her husband and the spectators
						told me she had often been relieved by reading texts pertinent to her case,
						— as Isa. 40, 1, ch. 49, 1, ch. 50, 1, and several others. These things I
						saw and heard from her.</p>
					<p>15. They were vehemently afflicted, to hinder any persons praying with them,
						or holding them in any religious discourse. The woman mentioned in the
						former section was told by the spectre I should not go to prayer; but she
						said I should, and, after I had done, reasoned with the apparition, “Did not
						I say he should go to prayer?” I went also to visit a person afflicted in
							<pb n="532" id="vII532"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2545">
							<figDesc>Page 532.</figDesc>
						</figure> Boston; and, after I was gone into the house to which she
						belonged, she being abroad, and pretty well, when she was told I was there,
						she said, “I am loath to go in; for I know he will fall into some good
						discourse, and then I am sure I shall go into a fit.” Accordingly, when she
						came in, I advised her to improve all the respite she had to make her peace
						with God, and sue out her pardon through Jesus Christ, and beg supplies of
						faith and every grace to deliver her from the powers of darkness; and,
						before I had uttered all this, she fell into a fearful fit of diabolical
						torture.</p>
					<p>16. Some of them were asked how it came to pass that they were not affrighted
						when they saw the <hi rend="italics">black-man:</hi> they said they were at
						first, but not so much afterwards.</p>
					<p>17. Some of them affirmed they saw the <hi rend="italics">black-man</hi> sit
						on the gallows, and that he whispered in the ears of some of the condemned
						persons when they were just ready to be turned off, even while they were
						making their last speech.</p>
					<p>18. They declared several things to be done by witchcraft, which happened
						before some of them were born, — as strange deaths of persons, casting away
						of ships, &amp;c.; and they said the spectres told them of it.</p>
					<p>19. Some of them have sundry times seen a <hi rend="italics">white-man</hi>
						appearing amongst the spectres, and, as soon as he appeared, the <hi
							rend="italics">black-witches</hi> vanished: they said this white-man had
						often foretold them what respite they should have from their fits, as
						sometimes a day or two or more, which fell out accordingly. One of the
						afflicted said she saw him, in her fit, and was with him in a glorious place
						which had no candle nor sun, yet was full of light and brightness, where
						there was a multitude in white, glittering robes, and they sang the song in
						Rev. 5, 9; Psal. 110, 149. She was loath to leave that place, and said, “<hi
							rend="italics">How long shall I stay here? Let me be along with
							you.</hi>” She was grieved she could stay no longer in that place and
						company.</p>
					<p>20. A young woman that was afflicted at a fearful rate had a spectre appeared
						to her with a white sheet wrapped about it, not visible to the standers
						until this sufferer (violently striving in her fit) snatched at, took hold,
						and tore off a corner of that sheet. Her father, being by her, endeavored to
						lay hold upon it with her, that she might retain what she had gotten; but,
						at the passing-away of the spectre, he had such a violent twitch of his hand
						as if it would have been torn off: immediately thereupon appeared in the
						sufferer hand the corner of a sheet, — a real cloth, <hi rend="italics"
							>visible</hi> to the spectators, which (as it is said) remains still to
						be seen.</p>
					<p rend="center">REMARKABLE THINGS RELATING TO THE ACCUSED.</p>
					<p>1. A woman, being brought upon public examination, desired to go to prayer.
						The magistrates told her they came not there to hear her pray, but to
						examine her in what was alleged against her relating to suspicions of
						witchcraft.</p>
					<p>2. It was observed, both in times of examination and trial, that the <pb
							n="533" id="vII533"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2546">
							<figDesc>Page 533.</figDesc>
						</figure> accused seemed little affected with what the sufferers underwent,
						or what was charged against them as being the instruments of Satan therein,
						so that the spectators were grieved at their unconcernedness.</p>
					<p>3. They were sometimes their <hi rend="italics">own image,</hi> and not
						always practising upon poppets made of clouts, wax, or other materials,
						(according to the old methods of witchcraft); for <hi rend="italics"
							>natural</hi> actions in them seemed to produce preternatural
						impressions on the afflicted, as biting their lips in time of examination
						and trial caused the sufferers to be bitten so as they produced the marks
						before the magistrates and spectators: the accused pinching their hands
						together seemed to cause the sufferers to be <hi rend="italics"
							>pinched;</hi> those again <hi rend="italics">stamping</hi> with their
						feet, <hi rend="italics">these</hi> were tormented in their legs and feet,
						so as they <hi rend="italics">stamped fearfully.</hi> After all this, if the
						accused did but lean against the bar at which they stood, some very sober
						women of the afflicted complained of their breasts, as if their bowels were
						torn out; thus, some have since confessed, they were wont to afflict such as
						were the objects of their malice.</p>
					<p>4. Several were accused of having familiarity with the <hi rend="italics"
							>black-man</hi> in time of examination and trial; and that he whispered
						in their ears, and therefore they could not hear the magistrates; and that
						one woman accused rid (in her shape and spectre) by the place of judicature,
						behind the black man, in the very time when she was upon examination.</p>
					<p>5. When the suspected were standing at the bar, the afflicted have affirmed
						that they saw their shapes in other places suckling a yellow bird; sometimes
						in one place and posture, and sometimes in another. They also foretold that
						the spectre of the prisoner was going to afflict such or such a sufferer,
						which presently fell out accordingly.</p>
					<p>6. They were accused by the sufferers to keep days of hellish fasts and
						thanksgivings; and, upon one of their fast-days, they told a sufferer she
						must not eat, it was fast-day. She said she would: they told her they would
						choke her then, which, when she did eat, was endeavored.</p>
					<p>7. They were also accused to hold and administer diabolical sacraments; viz.,
						a mock-baptism and a Devil-supper, at which cursed imitations of the sacred
						institutions of our blessed Lord they used forms of words to be trembled at
						in the very rehearsing: concerning baptism I shall speak elsewhere. At their
						cursed supper, they were said to have red bread and red drink; and, when
						they pressed an afflicted person to eat and drink thereof, she turned away
						her head, and spit at it, and said, “I will not eat, I will not drink: it is
						blood. That is not the bread of life, that is not the water of life; and I
						will have none of yours.” Thus horribly doth Satan endeavor to have his
						kingdom and administrations to resemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
					<p>8. Some of the most <hi rend="italics">sober</hi> afflicted persons, when
						they were well, did affirm the spectres of such and such as they did
						complain of in their fits did appear to them, and could relate what passed
						betwixt them and the apparitions, after their fits were over, and give
						account after what manner they were hurt by them.</p>
					<p>9. Several of the accused would neither in time of examination nor trial <pb
							n="534" id="vII534"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2547">
							<figDesc>Page 534.</figDesc>
						</figure> confess any thing of what was laid to their charge: some would not
						admit of any minister to pray with them, others refused to pray for
						themselves. It was said by some of the confessing witches, that such as have
						received the Devil-sacrament can never confess: only one woman condemned,
						after the death-warrant was signed, freely confessed, which occasioned her
						reprieval for some time; and it was observable this woman had one lock of
						hair of a very great length, viz., four foot and seven inches long by
						measure. This lock was of a different color from all the rest, which was
						short and gray. It grew on the hinder part of her head, and was matted
						together like an elf-lock. The Court ordered it to be cut off, to which she
						was very unwilling, and said she was told if it were cut off she should die
						or be sick; yet the Court ordered it so to be.</p>
					<p>10. A person who had been frequently transported to and fro by the devils for
						the space of near two years, was struck dumb for about nine months of that
						time; yet he, after that, had his speech restored to him, and did depose
						upon oath, that, in the time while he was dumb, he was many times bodily
						transported to places where the witches were gathered together, and that he
						there saw feasting and dancing; and, being struck on the back or shoulder,
						was thereby made fast to the place, and could only see and hear at a
						distance. He did take his oath that he did, with his bodily eyes, see some
						of the accused at those witch-meetings several times. I was present in court
						when he gave his testimony. He also proved by sundry persons, that, at those
						times of transport, he was bodily absent from his abode, and could nowhere
						be found, but being met with by some on the road, at a distance from his
						home, was suddenly conveyed away from them.</p>
					<p>11. The afflicted persons related that the spectres of several eminent
						persons had been brought in amongst the rest; but, as the sufferers said the
						Devil could not hurt them in their shapes, but two witches seemed to take
						them by each hand, and lead them or force them to come in.</p>
					<p>12. Whiles a godly man was at prayer with a woman afflicted, the daughter of
						that woman (being a sufferer in the like kind) affirmed that she saw two of
						the persons accused at prayer to the Devil.</p>
					<p>13. It was proved by substantial evidences against one person accused, that
						he had such an unusual strength (though a very little man), that he could
						hold out a gun with one hand behind the lock, which was near seven foot in
						the barrel, being as much as a lusty man could command with both hands after
						the usual manner of shooting. It was also proved, that he lifted barrels of
						meat and barrels of molasses out of a canoe alone, and that putting his
						fingers into a barrel of molasses (full within a finger's length according
						to custom) he carried it several paces; and that he put his finger into the
						muzzle of a gun which was more than five foot in the barrel, and lifted up
						the butt-end thereof, lock, stock, and all, without any visible help to
						raise it. It was also testified, that, being abroad with his wife and his
						wife's brother, he occasionally staid behind, letting his wife and her
						brother walk forward; but, suddenly coming up with them, he was angry with
						his wife for what <pb n="535" id="vII535"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2548">
							<figDesc>Page 535.</figDesc>
						</figure> discourse had passed betwixt her and her brother: they wondering
						how he should know it, he said, “I know your thoughts;” at which expression,
						they, being amazed, asked him how he could do that; he said, “My God, whom I
						serve, makes known your thoughts to me.”</p>
					<p>I was present when these things were testified against him, and observed that
						he could not make any plea for himself (in these things) that had any
						weight: he had the liberty of challenging his jurors before empanelling,
						according to the statute in that case, and used his liberty in challenging
						many; yet the jury that were sworn brought him in guilty.</p>
					<p>14. The magistrates privately examined a child of four or five years of age,
						mentioned in the remarks of the afflicted, sect. 11: [p. 530] and the child
						told them it had a little snake which used to suck on the lowest joint of
						its forefinger; and, when they (inquiring where) pointed to other places, it
						told them not <hi rend="italics">there</hi> but <hi rend="italics"
							>here,</hi> pointing on the lowest joint of the forefinger, where they
						observed a deep red spot about the bigness of a flea-bite. They asked it who
						gave it that snake, whether the black man gave it: the child said no, its
						mother gave it. I heard this child examined by the magistrates.</p>
					<p>15. It was proved by sundry testimonies against some of the accused, that,
						upon their malicious imprecations, wishes, or threatenings, many observable
						deaths and diseases, with many other odd inconveniences, have happened to
						cattle and other estate of such as were so threatened by them, and some to
						the persons of men and women.</p>
					<p rend="center">REMARKABLE THINGS CONFESSED BY SOME SUSPECTED OF BEING GUILTY
						OF WITCHCRAFT.</p>
					<p>1. It pleased God, for the clearer discovery of those mysteries of the
						kingdom of darkness, so to dispose, that several persons, men, women, and
						children, did confess their hellish deeds, as followeth: —</p>
					<p>2. They confessed against themselves that they were witches, told how long
						they had been so, and how it came about that the Devil appeared to them;
						viz., sometimes upon discontent at their mean condition in the world,
						sometimes about fine clothes, sometimes for the gratifying other carnal and
						sensual lusts. Satan then, upon his appearing to them, made them fair
						(though false) promises, that, if they would yield to him, and sign his
						book, their desires should be answered to the uttermost, whereupon they
						signed it; and thus the accursed confederacy was confirmed betwixt them and
						the Prince of Darkness.</p>
					<p>3. Some did affirm that there were some hundreds of the society of witches,
						considerable companies of whom were affirmed to muster in arms by beat of
						drum. In time of examinations and trials, they declared that such a man was
						wont to call them together from all quarters to witch-meetings with the
						sound of a diabolical trumpet.</p>
					<p>4. Being brought to see the prisoners at the bar upon their trials, they did
						affirm in open court (I was then present), that they had oftentimes seen <pb
							n="536" id="vII536"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2549">
							<figDesc>Page 536.</figDesc>
						</figure> them at witch-meetings, where was feasting, dancing, and jollity,
						as also at Devil-sacraments; and particularly that they saw such a man —
						amongst the rest of the cursed crew, and affirmed that he did administer the
						sacrament of Satan to them, encouraging them to go on in their way, and they
						should certainly prevail. They said also that such a woman — was a deacon,
						and served in distributing the diabolical elements: they affirmed that there
						were great numbers of the witches.</p>
					<p>5. They affirmed that many of those wretched souls had been baptized at
						Newbury Falls, and at several other rivers and ponds; and, as to the manner
						of administration, the great Officer of Hell took them up by the body, and,
						putting their heads into the water, said over them, “Thou art mine, I have
						full power over thee: and thereupon they engaged and covenanted to renounce
						God, Christ, their sacred baptism, and the whole way of Gospel salvation,
						and to use their utmost endeavors to oppose the kingdom of Christ, and to
						set up and advance the kingdom of Satan.</p>
					<p>6. Some, after they had confessed, were very penitent, and did wring their
						hands, and manifest a distressing sense of what they had done, and were by
						the mercies of God recovered out of those snares of the kingdom of
						darkness.</p>
					<p>7. Several have confessed against their own mothers, that they were
						instruments to bring them into the Devil's covenant, to the undoing of them,
						body and soul; and some girls of eight or nine years of age did declare,
						that, after they were so betrayed by their mothers to the power of Satan,
						they saw the Devil go in their own shapes to afflict others.</p>
					<p>8. Some of those that confessed were immediately afflicted at a dreadful
						rate, after the same manner with the other sufferers.</p>
					<p>9. Some of them confessed, that they did afflict the sufferers according to
						the time and manner they were accused thereof; and, being asked what they
						did to afflict them, some said that they pricked pins into poppets made with
						rags, wax, and other materials: one that confessed after the signing the
						death said she used to afflict them by clutching and pinching her hands
						together, and wishing in what part and after what manner she would have them
						afflicted, and it was done.</p>
					<p>10. They confessed the design was laid by this witchcraft to root out the
						interest of Christ in New England, and that they began at the Village in
						order to settling the kingdom of darkness and the powers thereof; declaring
						that such a man — was to be head conjurer, and for his activity in that
						affair was to be crowned king of hell, and that such a woman — was to be
						queen of hell.</p>
					<p>Thus I have given my reader a brief and true account of those fearful and
						amazing operations and intrigues of the Prince of Darkness: and I must call
						them so; for, let some persons be as incredulous as they please about the
						powerful and malicious influence of evil angels upon the minds and bodies of
						mankind, <hi rend="italics">sure I am</hi> none that observed those things
						above mentioned could refer them to any other head than the sovereign
						permission of the holy God, <pb n="537" id="vII537"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2550">
							<figDesc>Page 537.</figDesc>
						</figure> and the malicious operations of his and our implacable enemy. I
						have here related nothing more than what was acknowledged to be true by the
						judges that sat on the bench, and other credible persons there, which I have
						without prejudice or partiality represented.</p>
					<p>I therefore close all with my uncessant prayers, that the great and
						everlasting Jehovah would, for the sake of his blessed Son, our most
						glorious intercessor, rebuke Satan, and so vanquish him, from time to time,
						that his power may be more and more every day suppressed, his kingdom
						destroyed; and that all his malicious and accursed instruments in those
						spiritual wickednesses may gnash their teeth, melt away, and be ashamed in
						their secret places, till they come to be judged and condemned unto the
						place of everlasting burnings prepared for the Devil and his angels, that
						they may there be tormented with him for ever and ever.</p>

								<date>Aug. 9, 1692.</date></dateline>
						</opener>
						<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honored Sir,</hi> — According as in my former to you
							I hinted that I held myself obliged to give you some farther account of
							my rude though solemn thoughts of that great case now before you, the
							happy management whereof do so much conduce to the glory of God, the
							safety and tranquillity of the country, besides what I have said in my
							former and the enclosed, I further humbly present to consideration the
							doubtfulness and unsafety of admitting spectre testimony against the
							life of any that are of blameless conversation, and plead innocent, from
							the uncertainty of them and the incredulity of them; for as for
							diabolical visions, apparitions, or representations, they are more
							commonly false and delusive than real, and cannot be known when they are
							real and when feigned, but by the Devil's report; and then not to be
							believed, because he is the father of lies.</p>
						<p>1. Either the organ of the eye is abused and the senses deluded, so as to
							think they do see or hear some thing or person, when indeed they do not,
							and this is frequent with common jugglers.</p>
						<p>2. The Devil himself appears in the shape and likeness of a person or
							thing, when it is not the person or thing itself; so he did in the shape
							of Samuel.</p>
						<p>3. And sometimes persons or things themselves do really appear, but how
							it is possible for any one to give a true testimony, which possibly did
							see neither shape nor person, but were deluded; and if they did see any
							thing, they know not whether it was the person or but his shape. All
							that can be rationally or truly said in such a case is this, — that I
							did see the shape or likeness of such a person, if my senses or eyesight
							were not deluded: and they can honestly say no more, because they know
							no more (except the Devil tells them more); and if he do, they can but
							say he told them so. But the matter is still incredible: first, because
							it is but their saying the Devil told them so; if he did so tell them,
							yet the verity of the thing remains still unproved, because the Devil
							was a liar and a murtherer (John viii. 44), and may tell these lies to
							murder an innocent person.</p>
						<p>But this case seems to be solved by an assertion of some, that affirm
							that the Devil do not or cannot appear in the shape of a godly person,
							to do hurt: others affirm the contrary, and say that he can and often
							have so done, of <pb n="539" id="vII539"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2552">
								<figDesc>Page 539.</figDesc>
							</figure> which they give many instances for proof of what they say;
							which if granted, the case remains yet unsolved, and yet the very hinge
							upon which that weighty case depends. To which I humbly say: First, That
							I do lament that such a point should be so needful to be determined,
							which seems not probable, if possible, to be determined to infallible
							satisfaction for want of clear Scripture to decide it by, though very
							rational to be believed according to rules; as, for instance, if divers
							examples are alleged of the shape of persons that have been seen, of
							whom there is ample testimony that they lived and died in the faith,
							yet, saith the objecter, 'tis possible they may be hypocrites, therefore
							the proof not infallible: and as it may admit of such an objection
							against the reasons given on the affirmative, much more may the same
							objection be made against the negative, for which they can or do give no
							reason at all, nor can a negative be proved (therefore difficult to be
							determined to satisfy infallibly); but, seeing it must be discussed, I
							humbly offer these few words: First, I humbly conceive that the saints
							on earth are not more privileged in that case than the saints in heaven;
							but the Devil may appear in the shape of a saint in heaven, namely, in
							the shape of Samuel (1 Sam. xxviii. 13, 14); therefore he can or may
							represent the shape of a saint that is upon the earth. Besides, there
							may be innocent persons that are not saints, and their innocency ought
							to be their security, as well as godly men's; and I hear nobody question
							but the Devil may take their shape.</p>
						<p>Secondly, It doth not hurt any man or woman to present the shape or
							likeness of an innocent person, more than for a limner or carver to draw
							his picture, and show it, if he do not in that form do some evil (nor
							then neither) if the laws of man do not oblige him to suffer for what
							the Devil doth in his shape, the laws of God do not.</p>
						<p>Thirdly, The Devil had power, by God's permission, to take the very
							person of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the day or time of his humiliation,
							and carry him from place to place, and tempted him with temptations of
							horrid blasphemy, and yet left him innocent. Why may we not suppose the
							like may be done to a good man? And why not much more appear in his
							shape (or make folk think it is his shape, when indeed it is not), and
							yet the person be innocent, being far enough off, and not knowing of it,
							nor would consent if he had known it, his profession and conversation
							being otherwise?</p>
						<p>Fourthly, I suppose 'tis granted by all, that the person of one that is
							dead cannot appear, because the soul and body are separated, and so the
							person is dissolved, and so ceaseth to be: and it is as certain that the
							person of the living cannot be in two places at one time, but he that is
							at Boston cannot be at Salem or Cambridge at the same time; but as the
							malice and envy in the Devil makes it his business to seek whom he may
							devour, so no question but he doth infuse the same quality into those
							that leave Jesus Christ to embrace him, that they do envy those that are
							innocent, and upon that account be as ready to say and swear that they
							did see them as the Devil is to present their shape to them. Add but
							this also, that, when they are once under his power, he puts them on
							headlong (they must needs go whom the Devil drives, saith <pb n="540"
								id="vII540"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2553">
								<figDesc>Page 540.</figDesc>
							</figure> the proverb), and the reason is clear, — because they are
							taken captive by him, to do his will. And we see, by woful and
							undeniable experience, both in the afflicted persons and the confessors,
							some of them, that he torments them at his pleasure, to force them to
							accuse others. Some are apt to doubt they do but counterfeit; but, poor
							souls! I am utterly of another mind, and I lament them with all my
							heart; but, take which you please, the case is the same as to the main
							issue. For, if they counterfeit, the wickedness is the greater in them,
							and the less in the Devil: but if they be compelled to it by the Devil,
							against their wills, then the sin is the Devil's, and the sufferings
							theirs; but if their testimonies be allowed of, to make persons guilty
							by, the lives of innocent persons are alike in danger by them, which is
							the solemn consideration that do disquiet the country.</p>
						<p>Now, that the only wise God may so direct you in all, that he may have
							glory, the country peace and safety, and your hands strengthened in that
							great work, is the desire and constant prayer of your humble servant, R.
							P., who shall no further trouble you at present.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Position.</hi> — That to put a witch to death is the
							command of God, and therefore the indispensable duty of man, — namely,
							the magistrate (Ex. xxii. 18); which, granted, resolves two questions
							that I have heard made by some: —</p>
						<p>First, Whether there are any such creatures as witches in the world.
							Secondly, If there be, whether they can be known to be such by men: both
							which must be determined on the affirmative, or else that commandment
							were in vain.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Position Second.</hi> — That it must be witches that
							are put to death, and not innocent persons: “Thou shalt not condemn the
							innocent nor the righteous” (Ex. xxiii. 7).</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Query.</hi> — Which premised, it brings to this query,
							— namely, how a witch may be known to be a witch.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> — First, By the mouth of two or three
							witnesses (Deut. xix. 15; Matt. xviii. 16; Deut. xvii. 6). Secondly,
							They may be known by their own confession, being <hi rend="italics"
								>compos mentis,</hi> and not under horrid temptation to selfmurther
							(2 Sam. xvi.; Josh. vii. 16).</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Query Second.</hi> — What is it that those two or
							three witnesses must swear? Must they swear that such a person is a
							witch? Will that do the thing, as is vulgarly supposed?</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> — I think that is too unsafe to go by, as
							well as hard to be done by the advised: First, because it would expose
							the lives of all alike to the pleasure or passion of those that are
							minded to take them away; secondly, because that, in such a testimony,
							the witnesses are not only informers in matter of fact, but sole judges
							of the crime, — which is the proper work of the judges, and not of
							witnesses.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Query Third.</hi> — What is it that the witnesses must
							testify in the case, to prove one to be a witch?</p>
						<pb n="541" id="vII541"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2554">
								<figDesc>Page 541.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> — They must witness the person did put
							forth some act which, if true, was an act of witchcraft, or familiarity
							with the Devil, the witness attest the fact to be upon his certain
							knowledge, and the judges to judge. that fact to be such a crime.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Query Fourth.</hi> — What acts are they which must be
							proved to be committed by a person, that shall be counted legal proof of
							witchcraft, or familiarity with the Devil?</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> — This I do profess to be so hard a
							question, for want of light from the Word of God and laws of men, that I
							do not know what to say to it; and therefore humbly conceive, that, in
							such a difficulty, it may be more safe, for the present, to let a guilty
							person live till further discovery, than to put an innocent person to
							death.</p>
						<p>First, Because a guilty person may afterward be discovered, and so put to
							death; but an innocent person to be put to death cannot be brought again
							to life when once dead.</p>
						<p>Secondly, Because secret things belong to God only, but revealed things
							to us and to our children. And though it be so difficult sometimes, yet
							witches there are, and may be known by some acts or other put forth by
							them, that may render them such; for Scripture examples, I can remember
							but few in the Old Testament, besides Balaam (Num. xxii. 6, xxxi.
							16).</p>
						<p>First, The sorcerers of Egypt could not tell the interpretation of
							Pharaoh's dream, though he told them his dream (Gen. xli 8): his
							successors afterwards had sorcerers, that by enchantments did, first,
							turn their rods into serpents (Exod. vii. 11, 12); second, turned water
							into blood; thirdly, brought frogs upon the land of Egypt (Exod. viii.
							7).</p>
						<p>Thirdly, Nebuchadnezzar's magicians said that they would tell him the
							interpretation, if he would tell them his dream (Dan. iv. 7); but the
							king did not believe them (ver. 8, 9).</p>
						<p>Fourthly, The Witch of Endor raised the Devil, in the likeness of Samuel,
							to tell Saul his fortune; and Saul made use of him accordingly (1 Sam.
							xxviii. 8, 11-15); and, as for New Testament, I see very little of that
							nature. Our Lord Jesus Christ did cast out many devils, and so did his
							disciples, both while he was upon earth and afterward, of which some
							were dreadfully circumstanced (Mark ix. 18; Mark v. 2-5); but of
							witches, we only read of four mentioned in the apostles' time: first,
							Simon Magus (Acts viii. 9, 11); secondly, Elymas the sorcerer (Acts
							xiii. 6, 8); thirdly, the seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, that were vagabond
							Jews, — exorcists (Acts xix. 18-16); fourthly, the girl which, by a
							spirit of divination, brought her master much gain (Acts xvi. 16),
							whether it were by telling fortuns or finding out lost things, as our
							cunning men do, is not said; but something it was that was done by that
							spirit which was in her, which, being cast out, she could not do. Now,
							whatever was done by any of these, by the help of the Devil, or by
							virtue of familiarity with him, or that the Devil did do by their
							consent or instigation, it is that which, the like being now proved to
							be done by others, is legal conviction of witchcraft, or familiarity
							with the Devil.</p>
						<pb n="542" id="vII542"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2555">
								<figDesc>Page 542.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p>As I remember, Mr. Perkins apprehends witchcraft may be sometimes
							committed by virtue of an implicit covenant with the Devil, though there
							be not explicit covenant visibly between them; namely, by using such
							words and gestures whereby they do intimate to the Devil what they would
							have him do, and he doth it.</p>
						<p>3. To tell events contingent, or to bring any thing to pass by
							supernatural means, or by no means.</p>
						<p>I have heard of some that make a circle, and mumble over some uncouth
							words; and some that have been spiteful and suspicious persons, that
							have sent for a handful of thatch from the house or barn of him that
							they have owed a spite to, and the house have been burnt as they had
							burnt the thatch that they fetched.</p>
						<p>When Captain Smith was cast away in the ship built by Mr. Stevens at
							Gloucester, many years ago, it was said that the woman that was accused
							for doing it did put a dish in a pail of water, and sent her girl
							several times to see the motion of the dish, till at last it was turned
							over, and then the woman said, “Now Smith is gone,” <hi rend="italics"
								>or</hi> “is cast away.”</p>
						<p>A neighbor of mine, who was a Hampshire man, told me that a suspected
							woman desired something of some of the family, which being denied, she
							either muttered or threatened, and some evil suddenly followed, and they
							put her into a cart to carry her to Winchester; and, when they had gone
							a little way, the team could not move the cart, though in plain ground.
							The master commanded to carry a knitch of straw, and burn her in the
							cart; which to avoid, she said they should go along, and they did. This
							they did several times before they came to Winchester, of which passages
							the men that went with her gave their oaths, and she was executed.</p>
						<p>Some have been transformed into dogs, cats, hares, hogs, and other
							creatures; and in those shapes have sometimes received wounds which have
							made them undeniably guilty, and so confessed. Sometimes having their
							imps sucking them, or infallible tokens that they are sucked, in the
							search of which great caution to be given, because of some superfluities
							of nature, and diseases that people are incident unto, as the piles,
							&amp;c., of which the judges are, upon the testimony of the witnesses,
							to determine what of crime is proved by any of these circumstances, with
							many other, in which God is pleased many times, by some overt acts, to
							bring to light that secret wickedness to apparent conviction, sometimes
							by their own necessitated confession, whereby those that he hath
							commanded to be put to death may be known to be such, which, when known,
							then it is a duty to put them to death, and not before, though they were
							as guilty before as then.</p>
						<p>There are two queries more with respect to what is proper to us in this
							juncture of time, of which we have no account of the like being common
							at other times, or in other places; namely, these, —</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Query Fifth.</hi> — The fifth query is, what we are to
							think of those persons at Salem, or the Village, before whom people are
							brought for detection, or otherwise to be concerned with them, in order
							to their being apprehended or acquitted.</p>
						<pb n="543" id="vII543"/>
						<p>
							<figure id="Uphv2556">
								<figDesc>Page 543.</figDesc>
							</figure>
						</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> — That I am, of all men, the least able
							to give any conjecture about it, because I do not know it, having myself
							never seen it, nor know nothing of it but by report, in which there must
							be supposed a possibility of some mistake, in part or in whole; but that
							which I have here heard is this: First, That they do tell who are
							witches, of which some they know, and some they do not. Secondly, They
							tell who did torment such and such a person, though they know not the
							person. Thirdly, They are tormented themselves by the looks of persons
							that are present, and recovered again by the touching of them. Fourthly,
							That, if they look to them, they fall down tormented; but, if the
							persons accused look from them, they recover, or do not fall into that
							torment. Fifthly, They can tell when a person is coming before they see
							them, and what clothes they have, and some what they have done for
							several years past, which nobody else ever accused them with, nor do not
							yet think them guilty of. Sixthly, That the dead out of their graves do
							appear unto them, and tell them that they have been murdered, and
							require them to see them to be revenged on the murtherers, which they
							name to them; some of which persons are well known to die their natural
							deaths, and publicly buried in the sight of all men. Now, if these
							things be so, I thus affirm, —</p>
						<p>First, That whatsoever is done by them that is supernatural, is either
							divine or diabolical.</p>
						<p>Secondly, That nothing is, or can be, divine, but what have God's stamp
							upon it, to which he refers for trial (Isa. viii. 19, 20): “If they
							speak not according to these, there is no light in them.”</p>
						<p>Thirdly, And by that rule none of these actions of theirs have any
							warrant in God's word, but condemned wholly.</p>
						<p>First, It is utterly unlawful to inquire of the dead, or to be informed
							by them (Isa. viii. 19). It was an act of the Witch of Endor to raise
							the dead, and of a reprobate Saul to inquire of him (1 Sam. xxviii. 8,
							11-14; Deut. xviii. 11).</p>
						<p>Secondly, It is a like evil to seek to them that have familiar spirits
							(Lev. xix. 31). It was the sin of Saul in the forementioned place (1
							Sam. xxviii. 8); and of wicked Manasses (2 Kings, xxi. 6).</p>
						<p>Thirdly, No more is it likely that their racking and tormenting should be
							done by God or good angels, but by the Devil, whose manner have ever
							been to be so employed. Witness his dealing with the poor child (Mark
							ix. 17, 19, 20-22); and with the man that was possessed by him (Mark v.
							2-5); besides what he did to Job (Job ii. 7); and all the lies that he
							told against him to the very face of God.</p>
						<p>Fourthly, The same may be rationally said of all the rest. Who should
							tell them things that they do not see, but the Devil; especially when
							some things that they tell are false and mistaken?</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Query Sixth.</hi> — These things premised, it now
							comes to the last and greatest question or query; namely, How shall it
							be known when the Devil do any of these acts of his own proper motion,
							without human concurrence, <pb n="544" id="vII544"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2557">
								<figDesc>Page 544.</figDesc>
							</figure> consent, or instigation, and when he doth it by the suggestion
							or consent of any person? This question, well resolved, would do our
							business.</p>
						<p>First, That the Devil can do acts supernatural without the furtherance of
							him by human consent or concurrence; but men or women cannot do them
							without the help of the Devil (must be granted). That granted, it
							follows, that the Devil is always the doer, but whether abetted in it by
							anybody is uncertain.</p>
						<p>Secondly, Will it be sufficient for the Devil himself to say such a man
							or woman set him a work to torment such a person by looking upon him? Is
							the Devil a competent witness in such a case?</p>
						<p>Thirdly, Or are those that are tormented by him legal witnesses to say
							that the Devil doth it by the procurement of such a person, whenas they
							know nothing about it but what comes to them from the Devil (that
							torments them)?</p>
						<p>Fourthly, May we believe the witches that do accuse any one because they
							say so (can the fruit be better than the tree)? If the root of all their
							knowledge be the Devil, what must their testimony be?</p>
						<p>Fifthly, Their testimony may be legal against themselves, because they
							know what themselves do, but cannot know what another doth but by
							information from the Devil: I mean in such cases when the person accused
							do deny it, and his conversation is blameless (Prov. xviii. 5; Prov.
							xix. 5).</p>
						<p>First, It is directly contrary to the use of reason, the law of nature,
							and principles of humanity, to deny it, and plead innocent, when accused
							of witchcraft, and yet, at the same time, to be acting witchcraft in the
							sight of all men, when they know their lives lie at stake by doing it.
							Self-interest teaches every one better.</p>
						<p>Secondly, It is contrary to the Devil's nature, or common practice, to
							accuse witches. They are a considerable part of his kingdom, which would
							fall, if divided against itself (Matt. xii. 26); except we think he that
							spake the words understood not what he said (which were blasphemy to
							think); or that those common principles or maxims are now changed; or
							that the Devil have changed his nature, and is now become a reformer to
							purge out witches out of the world, out of the country, and out of the
							churches; and is to be believed, though a liar and a murtherer from the
							beginning, and also though his business is going about continually,
							seeking whom he may destroy (1 Pet. v. 8); and his peculiar subject of
							his accusation are the brethren: called the accuser of the brethren.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Objection.</hi> — God do sometimes bring things to
							light by his providence in a way extraordinary.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Answer.</hi> — It is granted God have so done, and
							brought hidden things to light, which, upon examination, have been
							proved or confessed, and so the way is clear for their execution; but
							what is that to this case, where the Devil is accuser and witness?</p>

						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>[The following passages are taken from the records of the Salem Village
						Church, as specimens of Mr. Parris's style of narrative in that interesting
						document, and as shedding some light upon the subject of these volumes:
						—]</p>
					<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sab:</hi> 4 Nov. [1694]. — After sermon in the
						afternoon, it was propounded to the brethren, whether the church ought not
						to inquire again of our dissenting brethren after the reason of their
						dissent. Nothing appearing from any against it, it was put to vote, and
						carried in the affirmative (by all, as far as I know, except one brother,
						Josh: Rea), that Brother Jno. Tarbell should, the next Lord's Day, appear
						and give in his reasons in public; the contrary being propounded, if any had
						aught to object against it. But no dissent was manifested; and so Brother
						Nathaniel Putnam and Deacon Ingersoll were desired to give this message from
						the church to the said Brother Tarbell.</p>
					<p>Sab: 11 Nov. — Before the evening blessing was pronounced, Brother Tarbell
						was openly called again and again; but, he not appearing, application was
						made to the abovesaid church's messengers for his answer: whereupon said
						Brother Putnam reported that the said Brother Tarbell told him he did not
						know how to come to us on a Lord's Day, but desired rather that he might
						make his appearance some week-day. Whereupon the congregation was dismissed
						with the blessing: and the church stayed, and, by a full vote, renewed their
						call of said Brother Tarbell to appear the next Lord's Day for the ends
						abovesaid; and Deacon Putnam and Brother Jonathan Putnam were desired to be
						its messengers to the said dissenting brother.</p>
					<p>Sab: 18 Nov. — The said brother came in the afternoon; and, after sermon, he
						was asked the reasons for his withdrawing: whereupon he produced a paper,
						which he was urged to deliver to the pastor to communicate to the church;
						but he refused it, asking who was the church's mouth. To which, when he was
						answered, “The pastor,” he replied, Not in this case, because his offence
						was with him. The pastor demanded whether he had offence against any of the
						church besides the pastor. He answered, “No.” So at length we suffered a
						non-member, Mr. Jos: Hutchinson, to read it. After <pb n="546" id="vII546"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2559">
							<figDesc>Page 546.</figDesc>
						</figure> which the pastor read openly before the whole congregation his
						overtures for peace and reconciliation. After which said Tarbell, seemingly
						(at least) much affected, said, that, if half so much had been said
						formerly, it had never come to this. But he added that others also were
						dissatisfied besides himself: and therefore he desired opportunity that they
						might come also, which was immediately granted; viz., the 26 instant, at two
						o'clock.</p>
					<p>26 Nov. — At the public meeting above appointed at the meeting-house, after
						the pastor had first sought the grace of God with us in prayer, he then
						summed up to the church and congregation (among which were several
						strangers) the occasion of our present assembling, as is hinted the last
						meeting. Then seeing, together with Brother Tarbell, two more of our
						dissenting brethren, viz., Sam: Nurse, and Thomas Wilkins (who had, to suit
						their designs, placed themselves in a seat conveniently together), the
						church immediately, to save further sending for them, voted that said
						Brother Wilkins and Brother Nurse should now, together with Brother Tarbell,
						give in their reasons of withdrawing from the church. Then the pastor
						applied himself to all these three dissenters, pressing the church's desire
						upon them. So they produced a paper, which they much opposed the coming into
						the pastor's hands, and his reading of it; but at length they yielded to it.
						Whilst the paper was reading, Brother Nurse looked upon another (which he
						said was the original): and, after it was read throughout, he said it was
						the same with what he had. Their paper was as followeth: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“The reasons why we withdraw from communion with the church of Salem
							Village, both as to hearing the word preached, and from partaking with
							them at the Lord's Table, are as followeth: —</p>
						<p>“1. Why we attend not on public prayer and preaching the word, these are,
							(1.) The distracting and disturbing tumults and noises made by the
							persons under diabolical power and delusions, preventing sometimes our
							hearing and understanding and profiting of the word preached; we having,
							after many trials and experiences, found no redress in this case,
							accounted ourselves under a necessity to go where we might hear the word
							in quiet. (2.) The apprehensions of danger of ourselves being accused as
							the Devil's instruments to molest and afflict the persons complaining,
							we seeing those whom we had reason to esteem better than ourselves thus
							accused, blemished, and of their lives bereaved, foreseeing this evil,
							thought it our prudence to withdraw. (3.) We found so frequent and
							positive preaching up some principles and practices by Mr. Parris,
							referring to the dark and dismal mysteries of iniquity working amongst
							us, as was not profitable, but offensive. (4.) Neither could we, in
							conscience, join with Mr. Parris in many of the requests which he made
							in prayer, referring to the trouble then among us and upon us; therefore
							thought it our most safe and peaceable way to withdraw.</p>
						<p>“2. The reasons why we hold not communion with them at the Lord's <pb
								n="547" id="vII547"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2560">
								<figDesc>Page 547.</figDesc>
							</figure> Table are, first, we esteem ourselves justly aggrieved and
							offended with the officer who doth administer, for the reasons
							following: (1.) From his declared and published principles, referring to
							our molestation from the invisible world, differing from the opinion of
							the generality of the Orthodox ministers of the whole country. (2.) His
							easy and strong faith and belief of the affirmations and accusations
							made by those they call the afflicted. (3.) His laying aside that grace
							which, above all, we are required to put on; namely, charity toward his
							neighbors, and especially towards those of his church, when there is no
							apparent reason for the contrary. (4.) His approving and practising
							unwarrantable and ungrounded methods for discovering what he was
							desirous to know referring to the bewitched or possessed persons, as in
							bringing some to others, and by and from them pretending to inform
							himself and others who were the Devil's instruments to afflict the sick
							and pained. (5.) His unsafe and unaccountable oath, given by him against
							sundry of the accused. (6.) His not rendering to the world so fair, if
							true, an account of what he wrote on examination of the afflicted. (7.)
							Sundry unsafe, if sound, points of doctrine delivered in his preaching,
							which we esteem not warrantable, if Christian. (8.) His persisting in
							these principles, and justifying his practices, not rendering any
							satisfaction to us when regularly desired, but rather further offending
							and dissatisfying ourselves.</p>

					</q>
					<p>When the pastor had read these charges, he asked the dissenters above
						mentioned whether they were offended with none in the church besides
						himself. They replied, that they articled against none else. Then the
						officer asked them if they withdrew from communion upon account of none in
						the church besides himself. They answered, that they withdrew only upon my
						account. Then I read them my “Meditations for Peace,” mentioned 18 instant;
						viz.: —</p>
					<q direct="unspecified">
						<p>“Forasmuch as it is the undoubted duty of all Christians to pursue peace
							(Ps. xxxiv. 14), even unto a reaching of it, if it be possible (Rom.
							xii. 18, 19); and whereas, through the righteous, sovereign, and awful
							Providence of God, the Grand Enemy to all Christian peace has, of late,
							been most tremendously let loose in divers places hereabouts, and more
							especially amongst our sinful selves, not only to interrupt that partial
							peace which we did sometimes enjoy, but also, through his wiles and
							temptations and our weaknesses and corruptions, to make wider breaches,
							and raise more bitter animosities between too many of us, in which dark
							and difficult dispensation we have been all, or most of us, of one mind
							for a time, and afterwards of differing apprehensions, and, at last, are
							but in the dark, — upon serious thoughts of all, and after many prayers,
							I have been moved to present to you (my beloved flock) the following
							particulars, in way of contribution <pb n="548" id="vII548"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2561">
								<figDesc>Page 548.</figDesc>
							</figure> towards a regaining of Christian concord (if so be we are not
							altogether unappeasable, irreconcilable, and so destitute of the good
							spirit which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be
							entreated, James iii. 17); viz., (1.) In that the Lord ordered the late
							horrid calamity (which afterwards, plague-like, spread in many other
							places) to break out first in my family, I cannot but look upon as a
							very sore rebuke, and humbling providence, both to myself and mine, and
							desire so we may improve it. (2.) In that also in my family were some of
							both parties, viz., accusers and accused, I look also upon as an
							aggravation of the rebuke, as an addition of wormwood to the gall. (3.)
							In that means were used in my family (though totally unknown to me or
							mine, except servants, till afterwards) to raise spirits and create
							apparitions in no better than a diabolical way, I do look upon as a
							further rebuke of Divine Providence. And by all, I do humbly own this
							day, before the Lord and his people, that God has been righteously
							spitting in my face (Num. xii. 14). And I desire to lie low under all
							this reproach, and to lay my hand upon my mouth. (4.) As to the
							management of those mysteries, as far as concerns myself, I am very
							desirous (upon farther light) to own any errors I have therein fallen
							into, and can come to a discerning of. In the mean while, I do
							acknowledge, upon after-considerations, that, were the same troubles
							again, (which the Lord, of his rich mercy, for ever prevent), I should
							not agree with my former apprehensions in all points; as, for instance,
							(1.) I question not but God sometimes suffers the Devil (as of late) to
							afflict in the shape of not only innocent but pious persons, or so
							delude the senses of the afflicted that they strongly conceit their hurt
							is from such persons, when, indeed, it is not. (2.) The improving of one
							afflicted to inquire by, who afflicts the others, I fear may be, and has
							been, unlawfully used, to Satan's great advantage. (3.) As to my
							writing, it was put upon me by authority; and therein I have been very
							careful to avoid the wronging of any (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>). (4).
							As to my oath, I never meant it, nor do I know how it can be otherwise
							construed, than as vulgarly and every one understood; yea, and upon
							inquiry, it may be found so worded also. (5.) As to any passage in
							preaching or prayer, in that sore hour of distress and darkness, I
							always intended but due justice on each hand, and that not according to
							man, but God (who knows all things most perfectly), however, through
							weakness or sore exercise, I might sometimes, yea, and possibly sundry
							times, unadvisedly expressed myself. (6.) As to several that have
							confessed against themselves, they being wholly strangers to me, but yet
							of good account with better men than myself, to whom also they are well
							known, I do not pass so much as a secret condemnation upon them; but
							rather, seeing God has so amazingly lengthened out Satan's chain in this
							most formidable outrage, I much more incline to side with the opinion of
							those that have grounds to hope better of them. (7.) As to all that have
							unduly suffered in these matters (either in their persons or relations),
							through the clouds of human weakness, and Satan's wiles and sophistry, I
							do truly sympathize with them; taking it for granted that such as drew
							themselves clear of this great transgression, <pb n="549" id="vII549"/>
							<figure id="Uphv2562">
								<figDesc>Page 549.</figDesc>
							</figure> or that have sufficient grounds so to look upon their dear
							friends, have hereby been under those sore trials and temptations, that
							not an ordinary measure of true grace would be sufficient to prevent a
							bewraying of remaining corruption. (8.) I am very much in the mind, and
							abundantly persuaded, that God (for holy ends, though for what in
							particular is best known to himself) has suffered the evil angels to
							delude us on both hands, but how far on the one side or the other is
							much above me to say. And, if we cannot reconcile till we come to a full
							discerning of these things, I fear we shall never come to agreement, or,
							at soonest, not in this world. Therefore (9), in fine, The matter being
							so dark and perplexed as that there is no present appearance that all
							God's servants should be altogether of one mind, in all circumstances
							touching the same, I do most heartily, fervently, and humbly beseech
							pardon of the merciful God, through the blood of Christ, of all my
							mistakes and trespasses in so weighty a matter; and also all your
							forgiveness of every offence in this and other affairs, wherein you see
							or conceive I have erred and offended; professing, in the presence of
							the Almighty God, that what I have done has been, as for substance, as I
							apprehended was duty, — however through weakness, ignorance, &amp;c., I
							may have been mistaken; I also, through grace, promising each of you the
							like of me. And so again, I beg, entreat, and beseech you, that Satan,
							the devil, the roaring lion, the old dragon, the enemy of all
							righteousness, may no longer be served by us, by our envy and strifes,
							where every evil work prevails whilst these bear sway (Isa. iii. 14-16);
							but that all, from this day forward, may be covered with the mantle of
							love, and we may on all hands forgive each other heartily, sincerely,
							and thoroughly, as we do hope and pray that God, for Christ's sake,
							would forgive each of ourselves (Matt. xviii. 21 <hi rend="italics">ad
								finem;</hi> Col. iii. 12, 13). Put on, therefore, as the elect of
							God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
							meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one
							another. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave
							you, so also do ye (Eph. iv. 31, 32). Let all bitterness and wrath and
							anger and clamor and evil-speaking be put away from you, with all
							malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender, forgiving one another,
							even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you. Amen, amen.</p>

					<p>[In the record, off against (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>) as above, the

					<p>(<hi rend="italics">a</hi>) Added, by the desire of the council, this

						Parris's controversy with the dissatisfied brethren, consequent upon the
						proceedings in 1692, was made originally on separate sheets of paper, and
						then compiled, and inscribed in the church, as it there appears. There are
						several other entries, which refer to dates ahead. He probably made out his
						record near the close of the struggle which resulted in his dismission, and
						left it, on the pages of the book, as his history of the case. After giving
						his “Meditations for Peace,” the record goes on: —]</p>
					<p>After I had read these overtures abovesaid, I desired the brethren to declare
						themselves whether they remained still dissatisfied. Brother Tarbell
						answered, that they desired to consider of it, and to have a copy of what I
						had read. I replied, that then they must subscribe their reasons (above
						mentioned), for as yet they were anonymous: so at length, with no little
						difficulty, I purchased the subscription of their charges by my abovesaid
						overtures, which I gave, subscribed with my name, to them, to consider of;
						and so this meeting broke up. Notes that, during this agitation with our
						dissenting brethren, they entertained frequent whisperings with comers and
						goers to them and from them; particularly Dan: Andrews, and Tho: Preston
						from Mr. Israel Porter, and Jos: Hutchinson, &amp;c.</p>
					<p>Nov. 30, 1694. — Brother Nurse and Brother Tarbell (bringing with them Joseph
						Putnam and Tho: Preston) towards night came to my house, where they found
						the two deacons and several other brethren; viz., Tho: Putnam, Jno. Putnam,
						Jr., Benj. Wilkins, and Ezek: Cheever, besides Lieutenant Jno. Walcot. And
						Brother Tarbell said they came to answer my paper, which they had now
						considered of, and their answer was this; viz., that they remained
						dissatisfied, and desired that the church would call a council, according to
						the advice we had lately from ministers.</p>
					<p>[An account has been given, p. 493, of the attempts of the “dissatisfied
						brethren” to procure a mutual council to decide the controversy between them
						and Mr. Parris. On the 14th of June, 1694, a letter was addressed to him,
						advising him to agree to the call of such a council, signed by John
						Higginson, of the First Church in Salem; James Allen, of the First Church in
						Boston; John Hale, of the church in Beverly; Samuel Willard, of the Old
						South Church in Boston; Samuel Cheever, of the church in Marblehead; and
						Joseph Gerrish, of the church in Wenham. Nicholas Noyes joined in the
						advice, “with this proviso, that he be not chosen one of the council.” Mr.
						Parris contrived to avoid following the advice. On the 10th of September,
						Messrs. Higginson, Allen, Willard, Cheever, and Gerrish again, in earnest
						and quite peremptory terms, renewed their advice in another letter to Mr.
						Parris. No longer venturing to resist their authority, he yielded, and
						consented to a mutual council, upon certain terms, one of which was, that
						neither of the churches whose ministers had thus forced him to the measure
						should be of the council. The following passages give the conclusion of the
						matter, as related by Mr. Parris in his record-book: —]</p>
					<p>Feb. 12 [1695]. — The church met again, as last agreed upon; and, after a
						while, our dissenting brethren, Tho: Wilkins, Sam: Nurse, and Jno. Tarbell,
						came also. After our constant way of begging the presence of God with us,
							<pb n="551" id="vII551"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2564">
							<figDesc>Page 551.</figDesc>
						</figure> we desired our dissenting brethren to acquaint us whether they
						would accept of our last proposals, which they desired to this day to
						consider of. They answered, that they were willing to drop the six churches
						from whose elders we had had the advice abovesaid, dated 14 June last; but
						they were not free to exclude Ipswich. This they stuck unto long, and then
						desired that they might withdraw a little to confer among themselves about
						it, which was granted. But they quickly returned, as resolved for Ipswich as
						before. We desired them to nominate the three churches they would have sent
						to: and, after much debate, they did; viz., Rowley, Salisbury, and Ipswich.
						Whereupon we voted, by a full consent, Rowley and Salisbury churches for a
						part of the council, and desired them to nominate a third church. But still
						they insisted on Ipswich, which we told them they were openly informed, the
						last meeting, that we had excepted against. Then they were told that we
						would immediately choose three other churches to join with the two before
						nominated and voted, if they saw not good to nominate any more; or else we
						would choose two other churches to join with the aforesaid two, if they
						pleased. They answered, they would be willing to that, if Ipswich might be
						one of them. Then it was asked them, if a dismission to some other Orthodox
						church, where they might better please themselves, would content them.
						Brother Tarbell answered, “Ay, if we could find a way to remove our livings
						too.” Then it was propounded, whether we could not unite amongst ourselves.
						The particular answer hereunto I remember not; but (I think) such hints were
						given by them as if it were impossible. Thus much time being gone, it being
						well towards sunset, and we concluding that it was necessary that we should
						do something ourselves, if they would not (as the elders had heretofore
						desired) accept of our joining with them, we dismissed them; and, by a
						general agreement amongst ourselves, read and voted letters to the churches
						at North Boston, Weymouth, Malden, and Rowley, for their help in a
						council.</p>
					<p>[Mr. Parris's plan of finding refuge in an <hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi>
						council was utterly frustrated. On the 1st of March, the “reverend elders in
						the Bay accounted it advisable,” as he expresses it in his records, that the
						First Church and the Old South Church in Boston should be added to the
						council. They wrote to him to that effect, and he had to comply. This
						brought James Allen and Samuel Willard into the council, and determined the
						character of the result, which, coming from a tribunal called by him to
						adjudicate the case, and hearing only such evidence as he laid before it, so
						far as it bore against him, was decisive and fatal. It was as follows:
						—]</p>
					<p>The elders and messengers of the churches — met in council at Salem Village,
						April 3, 1695, to consider and determine what is to be done for the
						composure of the present unhappy differences in that place, — after solemn
						invocation of God in Christ for his direction, do unanimously declare and
						advise as followeth: —</p>
					<p>I. We judge that, albeit in the late and the dark time of the confusions,
						wherein Satan had obtained a more than ordinary liberty to be sifting of
						this plantation, there were sundry unwarrantable and uncomfortable steps
						taken <pb n="552" id="vII552"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2565">
							<figDesc>Page 552.</figDesc>
						</figure> by Mr. Samuel Parris, the pastor of the church in Salem Village,
						then under the hurrying distractions of amazing afflictions; yet the said
						Mr. Parris, by the good hand of God brought unto a better sense of things,
						hath so fully expressed it, that a Christian charity may and should receive
						satisfaction therewith.</p>
					<p>II. Inasmuch as divers Christian brethren in the church of Salem Village have
						been offended at Mr. Parris for his conduct in the time of the difficulties
						and calamities which have distressed them, we now advise them charitably to
						accept the satisfaction which he hath tendered in his Christian
						acknowledgments of the errors therein committed; yea, to endeavor, as far as
						'tis possible, the fullest reconciliation of their minds unto communion with
						him, in the whole exercise of his ministry, and with the rest of the church
						(Matt. vi. 12-14; Luke xvii. 8; James v. 16).</p>
					<p>III. Considering the extreme trials and troubles which the dissatisfied
						brethren in the church of Salem Village have undergone in the day of sore
						temptation which hath been upon them, we cannot but advise the church to
						treat them with bowels of much compassion, instead of all more critical or
						rigorous proceedings against them, for the infirmities discovered by them in
						such an heart-breaking day. And if, after a patient waiting for it, the said
						brethren cannot so far overcome the uneasiness of their spirits, in the
						remembrance of the disasters that have happened, as to sit under his
						ministry, we advise the church, with all tenderness, to grant them a
						dismission unto any other society of the faithful whereunto they may desire
						to be dismissed (Gal. vi. 1, 2; Ps. ciii. 13, 14; Job xix. 21).</p>
					<p>IV. Mr. Parris having, as we understand, with much fidelity and integrity
						acquitted himself in the main course of his ministry since he hath been
						pastor to the church in Salem Village, about his first call whereunto, we
						look upon all contestations now to be both unreasonable and unseasonable;
						and our Lord having made him a blessing unto the souls of not a few, both
						old and young, in this place, we advise that he be accordingly respected,
						honored, and supported, with all the regards that are due to a painful
						minister of the gospel (1 Thess. v. 12, 13; 1 Tim. v. 17).</p>
					<p>V. Having observed that there is in Salem Village a spirit full of
						contentions and animosities, too sadly verifying the blemish which hath
						heretofore lain upon them, and that some complaints brought against Mr.
						Parris have been either causeless and groundless, or unduly aggravated, we
						do, in the name and fear of the Lord, solemnly warn them to consider,
						whether, if they continue to devour one another, it will not be bitterness
						in the latter end; and beware lest the Lord be provoked thereby utterly to
						deprive them of those which they should account their precious and pleasant
						things, and abandon them to all the desolations of a people that sin away
						the mercies of the gospel (James iii. 16; Gal. v. 15; 2 Sam. ii. 26; Isa. v.
						4, 5, 6; Matt. xxi. 43).</p>
					<p>VI. If the distempers in Salem Village should be (which God forbid!) so
						incurable, that Mr. Parris, after all, find that he cannot, with any comfort
							<pb n="553" id="vII553"/>
						<figure id="Uphv2566">
							<figDesc>Page 553.</figDesc>
						</figure> and service, continue in his present station, his removal from
						thence will not expose him unto any hard character with us, nor, we hope,
						with the rest of the people of God among whom we live (Matt. x. 14; Acts
						xxii. 18).</p>
					<p>All which advice we follow with our prayers that the God of peace would

					<p>[The names of the lay members of the Council are marked thus, <unclear/>.
						They were persons of high standing in civil life. Samuel Checkley was not
						(as stated [Supplement, p. 494], through an inadvertence, of which, I crust,
						not many such instances can be found in these volumes) the Rev. Mr.
						Checkley, but his father, Col. Samuel Checkley, a citizen of Boston, of much
						prominence at the time.</p>
					<p>The foregoing document is skilfully drawn. While kindly in its tone towards
						Mr. Parris, it is, in reality, a strong condemnation of his course,
						especially in Article I., as also in the paragraph marked (<hi
							rend="italics">a</hi>), (p. 549), “added by the desire of the Council”
						to his “Meditations for Peace.” Article III. discountenances the proceedings
						of his church in its censure of “the dissatisfied brethren,” and requires
						that they should be recognized and treated as members in good standing. The
						fifth article administers rebuke with an equal hand to both sides, while the
						sixth and last recommends the removal of Mr. Parris, if the alienation of
						his opponents should prove “incurable.”</p>
					<p>As an authoritative condemnation of the proceedings related in this work,
						pronounced at the time, it is a fitting final close of the presentation of
						this subject.]</p>
