            <p>
               <strong>April 11th 1692.</strong>  Went to Salem, where, in the Meeting-house, the persons accused of Witchcraft were examined; was a very great Assembly;
               ëtwas awfull to see how the afflicted persons were agitated.  Mr. Noyes prayíd at the beginning, and Mr. Higginson concluded.

               <strong>May 24th 1692.</strong>  First general Council, Saltonstall, Major Gedny, Walley, Hutchinson, Lothrop, Alcot, Sewall took their Oaths together, presently
               after Major Appleton took his.  Justices of the Peace were nominated for the Province.

            <p>
               <strong>July 20th 1692.</strong>  Fast at the house of Capt. Alden, upon his account.  Mr. Willard prayíd.  I read a Sermon out of Dr. Preston, 1st and 2d
               Uses of Godís Alsufficiency.  Capt. Scottow prayíd, Mr. Allen came in and prayíd, Mr. Cotton Mather, then Capt. Hill.  Sung
               the first part 103.Ps., concluded about 5. aclock.  Brave Shower of Rain while Capt. Scottow was praying, after much Drought.
               Cous. Daniel Gookin sups with us, and bespeaks my marrying of him tomorrow.

            <p>
               <strong>July 30, 1692.</strong>  Mrs. Cary makes her escape out of Cambridge ñPrison, who was Committed for Witchcraft.

               <strong>Augt. 19th 1692.</strong>  This day the Liet. Governour, Major Phillips, Mr. Russel, Capt. Lynde and my self went to Watertown.  Advisíd the Inhabitants
               at their Town-Meeting to settle a Minister; and if could not otherwise agree, should first have a Town-Meeting to decide where
               the Meetinghouse should be set.  Many say Whitneyís Hill would be a convenient place.
            </p>
            
            <p>This day [in the margin, Dolefull!  Witchcraft] George Burrough, John Willard, Jno Procter, Martha Carrier and George Jacobs
               were executed at Salem, a very great number of Spectators being present.  Mr. Cotton Mather was there, Mr. Sims, Hale, Noyes,
               Chiever, &amp;c.  All of them said they were innocent, Carrier and all.  Mr. Mather says they all died by a Righteous Sentence.
               Mr. Burrough by his Speech, Prayer, protestation of his Innocence, did much move unthinking persons, which occasions their
               speaking hardly concerning his being executed.

               another, by the Court and Capt. Gardner of Nantucket who had been of his acquaintance: but all in vain.

               was very dark, so that getting some way beyond the fortification, was fain to come back again, and lodgd here in Capt. Henchmanís
               Room.  Has been a plentiful Rain, blessed be God.  Mr. Stoughton went away early in the morn so that I saw him not.  Read

            <p>
               <strong>Nov. 22, 1692.</strong>  I prayd that God would pardon all my Sinfull Wanderings, and direct me for the future.  That God would bless the Assembly
               in their debates, and that would chse and assist our Judges, &amp;c., and save New England as to Enemies and Witchcrafts, and
               vindicate the late Judges, consisting with his Justice and Holiness, &amp;c., with Fasting.  Cousin Anne Quinsy visited me in
               the Evening, and told me of her childrenís wellfare.  Now about, Mercy Short grows ill again, as formerly.

               and that was glad of his Restauration.

            <p>
               <strong>Fourth-day Augt 12, 1696.</strong>  Mr. Melyen, upon a slight occasion, spoke to me very smartly about the Salem Witchcraft: in discourse he said, if a man
               should take Beacon hill on ës back, carry it away; and then bring it and set it in its place again, he should not make any
               thing of that.

            <hr></hr>
            
            
            <p>Copy of the Bill I put up on the Fast day; giving it to Mr. Willard as he passíd by, and standing up at the reading of it,
               and bowing when finished; in the Afternoon.
            </p>
            
            <p>Samuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated strokes of God upon himself and family; and being sensible, that as to the Guilt
               contracted, upon the opening of the late Commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order for this Day relates)
               he is, upon many accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, Desires to take the Blame and Shame of it, Asking pardon
               of Men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who has an Unlimited Authority, would pardon that sin and all other his
               sins; personal and Relative: And according to his infinite Benignity, and Soveraignty, Not Visit the Sin of him, or of any
               other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the Land: But that He would powerfully defend him against all Temptations to Sin,
               for the future; and vouchsafe him the efficacious, saving Conduct of his Word and Spirit.

               <strong>Sixth-day, Novr 19.</strong>  Mr. Higginson coms as far as Brothers to see me; which I wonderíd at.  Mr Hale and I lodged together: He discoursíd me about
               writing a History of the Witchcraft; I fear lest he go into the other exream.  Came home with the Majr General, diníd at Madam
               Paiges; there found Hancock, Allen, and Sam. Haugh.  Found all well, Laus Deo.  At Col. Paiges was told of the Death of Mrs.
               Thatcher.  When came home, Mr. Cooke told me of the death of Mr. Hooker of Farmington.

               <strong>May, 3.</strong>  I went not to court in the morning because of my Letters.  Dr. Mather sends me Mr. Daniel Nealís History of New-England:
               It grievs me to see New Englandís Nakedness laid open in the business of the Quakers, Anabaptists, Witchcraft.  The Judges
               Names are mentioned, p. 502.  My Confession, p.536.  Vol. 2.  The Good and Gracious God to be pleased to save New-England,
               and me and my family!
